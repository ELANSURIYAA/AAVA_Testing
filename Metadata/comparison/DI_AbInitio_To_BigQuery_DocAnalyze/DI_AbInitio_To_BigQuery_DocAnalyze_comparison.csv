deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been reorganized with enhanced hierarchy and additional metadata fields. Key challenges include structural reorganization, field renaming, and model deployment abstraction that may impact dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality remain semantically identical. All three agents (DI_AbInitio_Documentation, DI_AbInitio_To_BigQuery_Analyzer, DI_AbInitio_To_BigQuery_Plan) preserve their business logic and task descriptions exactly.",4,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy, increasing organizational depth and complexity.",4,2
deductions,field_change,"Root workflow identifier renamed from 'workflowId' to 'id' within workFlowDetail object. Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name field renamed from 'workflowName' to 'name' within workFlowDetail object. Value content identical but access path modified.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from 'agentName' to 'name' within workflowAgents array. Semantic equivalence maintained.",6,9
deductions,field_change,"Model specification evolved from direct model names ('anthropic.claude-4-sonnet', 'gemini-2.5-pro', 'gpt-4') to abstracted 'modelDeploymentName' with standardized 'gpt-4.1' values.",7,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces new 'agentId' field (values: 16704, 16729, 16733) providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"New 'toolReferences' array field added in AAVA 2.0 (currently empty arrays) suggesting future tool integration capabilities.",0,12
deductions,field_change,"Task structure field renamed from 'task' to 'description' with nested task object flattened in AAVA 2.0.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed from 'tools: []' in AAVA 1.0 to 'toolReferences: []' in AAVA 2.0, indicating potential tool reference model evolution.",9,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Model deployment abstraction in AAVA 2.0 may reduce traceability to specific AI model versions, potentially impacting reproducibility and governance.",7,10
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types, proper array structures, and no broken references. All nested objects properly formatted.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced hierarchy, consistent field types, and proper object nesting. No syntax errors or broken references detected.",0,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"The evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a controlled schema migration with preserved semantic meaning but significant structural reorganization requiring mapping logic for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers, ETL pipelines, or governance tools that expect AAVA 1.0 flat structure. Migration requires comprehensive dependency analysis.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Model deployment abstraction may impact cost tracking, performance monitoring, and audit trails that rely on specific model identification.",7,10
deductions,general_finding,"Task descriptions and business logic remain 100% identical across both versions, ensuring functional equivalence despite structural changes.",10,11
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces forward-looking architectural elements (agentId, toolReferences) suggesting platform evolution toward more sophisticated agent orchestration.",0,8
