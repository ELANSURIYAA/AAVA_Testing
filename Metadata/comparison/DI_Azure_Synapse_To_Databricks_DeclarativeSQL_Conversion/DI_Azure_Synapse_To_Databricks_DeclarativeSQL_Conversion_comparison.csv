deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major changes include workflow structure reorganization, agent identification methodology, and model deployment naming conventions. Both versions maintain high syntactic correctness but exhibit moderate structural divergence.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose (DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Databricks_DeclarativeSQL_Conversion) preserved across both versions with identical business intent.",3,4
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All five agents maintain semantic equivalence: Converter, UnitTest, Conversion_Tester, Recon_Tester, and Reviewer agents preserve identical functional descriptions.",5,7
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions and expected outputs remain semantically consistent across agent definitions, ensuring business logic preservation.",15,20
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root object structure completely reorganized: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0 nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' properties to nested 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with internal property restructuring.",5,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification changed from 'agentName' to 'name' property while adding new 'agentId' numeric identifier.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification evolved from 'model' property to 'modelDeploymentName' with updated naming convention (anthropic.claude-4-sonnet -> gpt-4.1).",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened from nested 'task' object to direct 'description' property, removing 'expectedOutput' nesting.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Tools array renamed from 'tools' to 'toolReferences' indicating architectural shift in tool management.",9,12
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (7575) to integer (5708) maintaining type consistency but different values.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId as required numeric identifier for each agent, adding referential constraint not present in AAVA 1.0.",8,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes 'expectedOutput' metadata from task definitions, reducing descriptive completeness compared to AAVA 1.0.",15,
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' specifications in AAVA 2.0 may impact downstream systems expecting detailed output format definitions.",15,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat agent array to nested workflow structure suggests evolution toward more hierarchical metadata organization.",5,2
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper nesting and consistent property naming throughout.",1,
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting AAVA 1.0 flat 'nodes' array structure.",5,7
deduction,risk,"Model deployment name changes could impact agent instantiation if systems rely on specific model identifiers.",7,10
deduction,risk,"Removal of 'expectedOutput' metadata may affect validation and testing frameworks dependent on output specifications.",15,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (5) and preserve all core functional descriptions.",5,7
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow naming convention shows minor inconsistency: 'workflowName' vs 'name' property naming.",3,4
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain character-for-character identical across versions, ensuring functional consistency.",15,20
