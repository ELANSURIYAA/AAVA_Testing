deductions,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces architectural improvements including agent ID management and model deployment standardization while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains 5 agents with identical business logic but implements enhanced metadata organization.",1,1

deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Databricks_DeclarativeSQL_Converter maintains identical conversion logic and instructions across both versions.",7,6
