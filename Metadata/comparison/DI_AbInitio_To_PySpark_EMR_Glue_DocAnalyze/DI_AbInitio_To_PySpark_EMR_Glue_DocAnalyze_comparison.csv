deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata structure but breaks backward compatibility through field renames and hierarchy changes.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core business logic and agent functionality remain semantically equivalent between versions. All three agents (Documentation, Analyzer, Plan) preserve their original purpose and task descriptions.",3,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure with enhanced metadata.",1,1
deduction,field_change,"Root workflow identifier changed from 'workflowId' to nested 'workFlowDetail.id'. Semantic meaning preserved but path changed.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field changed from 'workflowName' to 'workFlowDetail.name'. Note inconsistent camelCase usage in v2.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' array to 'workflowAgents' array. Improves semantic clarity.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from implicit array position to explicit 'agentId' field. Enhances referential integrity.",5,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent name field renamed from 'agentName' to 'name' within agent context. Reduces redundancy.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model specification changed from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName'. Provides more specific deployment context.",7,11
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened from nested 'task' object to direct 'description' field. Simplifies structure but loses task metadata.",8,12
deduction,field_change,"Tools array renamed from 'tools' to 'toolReferences'. Suggests enhanced tool management system.",9,13
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID type appears consistent (integer) but context changed from direct field to nested object property.",2,2
deduction,constraint_change,"Task 'expectedOutput' field completely removed in AAVA 2.0. Significant metadata loss for validation purposes.",Multiple,None
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' specifications reduces metadata completeness and validation capabilities in downstream systems.",Multiple,None
deduction,governance_issue,"Inconsistent naming convention: 'workFlowDetail' uses PascalCase while 'workflowAgents' uses camelCase.",None,2
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and complete metadata fields.",All,None
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has naming inconsistencies and missing expectedOutput fields.",None,All
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant schema evolution with improved agent identification but reduced task metadata completeness.",All,All
deduction,ambiguity,"The removal of 'expectedOutput' fields creates ambiguity about agent output specifications and validation requirements.",Multiple,None
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in field names and structure will require updates to all dependent systems and APIs.",All,All
deduction,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata may impact automated validation and quality assurance processes.",Multiple,None
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 shows architectural improvement in agent identification and workflow organization but sacrifices some metadata richness.",All,All
deduction,general_finding,"The structural changes suggest evolution toward more enterprise-grade metadata management with explicit IDs and references.",All,All
