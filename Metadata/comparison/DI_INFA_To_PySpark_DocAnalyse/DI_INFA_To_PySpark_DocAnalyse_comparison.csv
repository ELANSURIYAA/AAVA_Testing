deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced agent modeling with explicit IDs and deployment specifications while removing task separation and expected output definitions. The semantic meaning is largely preserved but structural changes impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent pipeline for Informatica to PySpark documentation and analysis. Business logic remains consistent across DI_Informatica_Documentation, DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Analyzer, and DI_INFA_to_PySpark_Plan agents.",3,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes maintain semantic alignment: Documentation generation, complexity analysis, and conversion planning functionality preserved between versions.",4,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses workflowId/workflowName with nodes array, while AAVA 2.0 uses workFlowDetail object with workflowAgents array.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent modeling enhanced: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId (7549, 7471, 7425) and modelDeploymentName (gpt-4.1) replacing simple model field (gpt-4).",5,5
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier restructured: workflowId (148) and workflowName became workFlowDetail.id (4880) and workFlowDetail.name with different values.",2,2
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed: nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array maintaining same structural purpose.",3,3
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming evolution: agentName became name, model became modelDeploymentName with version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",5,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task object elimination: AAVA 2.0 flattens task.description directly into agent.description, removing task wrapper and expectedOutput field entirely.",8,7
deductions,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed: AAVA 1.0 task.expectedOutput field (containing detailed format requirements) completely absent in AAVA 2.0.",8,
deductions,field_change,"Tools handling simplified: AAVA 1.0 tools array replaced with toolReferences array in AAVA 2.0, both empty but different naming.",7,8
deductions,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: Simple string model field upgraded to modelDeploymentName with version specificity (gpt-4.1 vs gpt-4).",6,7
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax valid: Well-formed JSON structure with consistent property types and no syntax errors.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency maintained: All agent references, field types, and structural relationships are logically consistent.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax valid: Properly formatted JSON with correct bracket matching and property definitions.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: Agent name variations (DI_Informatica_Documentation vs DI Informatica Documentation) show inconsistent naming patterns.",6,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Structural consistency: All agentId references are unique integers and modelDeploymentName consistently specified.",5,
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata quality degradation: Loss of expectedOutput field reduces documentation completeness and format specification clarity.",8,
deductions,governance_issue,"Naming convention inconsistency: Mixed underscore and space usage in agent names reduces standardization.",4,6
deductions,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility impact: Structural changes require migration logic for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format (workflowId, nodes, task objects).",2,2
deductions,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata richness: Addition of agentId and modelDeploymentName provides better tracking and version management capabilities.",5,5
deductions,risk,"Breaking change risk: Removal of expectedOutput field may impact downstream systems relying on detailed output format specifications.",8,
deductions,risk,"Migration complexity: Field renames and structural reorganization require comprehensive mapping logic for system upgrades.",1,1
deductions,ambiguity,"Workflow ID correlation unclear: Relationship between AAVA 1.0 workflowId (148) and AAVA 2.0 workFlowDetail.id (4880) not explicitly defined.",2,2
deductions,general_finding,"Content preservation: Despite structural changes, core agent descriptions and business logic remain substantially intact with 95%+ content similarity.",4,7
deductions,general_finding,"Version evolution pattern: AAVA 2.0 demonstrates clear progression toward more structured agent modeling with enhanced metadata tracking.",1,1
