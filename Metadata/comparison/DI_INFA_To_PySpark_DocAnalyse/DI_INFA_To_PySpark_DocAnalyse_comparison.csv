deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and minor semantic evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical restructuring while preserving core business logic.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent workflow for Informatica to PySpark conversion with documentation, analysis, and planning phases.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical across versions with consistent business objectives for data migration workflows.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",3,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed from simple integer 'workflowId' to structured object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (integer) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (integer) - semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (string) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (string) - semantic meaning preserved with structural reorganization.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' - semantic meaning preserved but implies more specific agent-focused terminology.",4,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'agentName' renamed to 'name' - simplified naming convention within agent context.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'model' renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' - more descriptive and deployment-specific terminology.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'tools' renamed to 'toolReferences' - more explicit about reference nature of tool associations.",9,16
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure completely flattened: AAVA 1.0 nested task object removed, description moved to agent level in AAVA 2.0.",10,12
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'gpt-4' changed to 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade in deployment configuration.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Agent identification added: AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field providing unique identifiers missing in AAVA 1.0.",7,9
deduction,governance_issue,"Task structure simplified but potentially loses granular task metadata organization present in AAVA 1.0.",10,12
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"JSON structure valid with proper nesting and consistent data types throughout the document.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"All required fields present with appropriate string and integer types for workflow and agent definitions.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"JSON structure valid but introduces potential inconsistency with camelCase 'workFlowDetail' mixing conventions.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"Missing 'expectedOutput' field in agent definitions that was present in AAVA 1.0 task structure.",12,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents modernization with improved agent identification and deployment-specific model naming.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Structural reorganization improves logical grouping but may impact backward compatibility for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Breaking change: Flat 'nodes' to nested 'workflowAgents' structure requires significant parsing logic updates in downstream systems.",4,8
deduction,risk,"Task metadata loss: Removal of explicit task object may impact systems expecting granular task-level configuration.",10,12
deduction,risk,"Field path changes require comprehensive mapping updates in analytics pipelines and governance tooling.",2,3
deduction,ambiguity,"Inconsistent naming convention: 'workFlowDetail' uses mixed case while other fields follow camelCase pattern.",2,2
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: All agent descriptions and business logic remain identical between versions ensuring functional continuity.",12,12
deduction,general_finding,"Enhanced metadata: Addition of agentId provides better traceability and system integration capabilities.",7,9
deduction,general_finding,"Model versioning: Explicit version specification in modelDeploymentName improves deployment management.",8,11
