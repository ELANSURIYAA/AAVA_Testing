deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same core data transformation workflow (Ab Initio DML to PySpark) but with significant structural reorganization and some semantic drift. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more hierarchical structure while maintaining core functionality.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core semantic meaning preserved: both versions define a data transformation agent for converting Ab Initio DML files to PySpark StructType schemas. The business purpose remains identical.",4,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions are semantically equivalent with 95% content overlap, both focusing on DML parsing, type mapping, and StructType generation.",9,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",3,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification moved from top-level 'workflowId/workflowName' to nested 'workFlowDetail.id/name' structure, increasing hierarchy depth.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (value: 8578) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (value: 1858). Values differ significantly indicating different workflow instances.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' with content change from 'DI_AbInitio_DML_To_PySpark_EMR_Glue' to 'DI AbInitio DML To PySpark'.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with structural changes in agent definition.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from 'agentName' to 'name' within agent objects.",6,9
deductions,type_change,"Agent model reference changed from 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' with different values ('anthropic.claude-4-sonnet' vs 'gpt-4.1').",7,10
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed from empty 'tools' array to 'toolReferences' array, maintaining empty state but different naming.",8,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field (value: 3412) not present in AAVA 1.0, adding unique identification.",0,8
deductions,governance_issue,"Task description in AAVA 2.0 removes EMR-Glue specific references, reducing specificity from 'AWS Glue/EMR-compatible' to generic 'PySpark'.",9,11
deductions,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes detailed Glue-specific requirements like 'DynamicFrame contexts' and 'GlueContext-based jobs', reducing technical precision.",9,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",0,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but contains inconsistent casing in 'workFlowDetail' (camelCase 'Flow' vs expected 'workflowDetail').",3,0
deductions,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution shows progression from simple flat structure to more enterprise-ready hierarchical organization with workflow and agent separation.",0,0
deductions,risk,"Breaking change: Tools expecting 'workflowId' field will fail as it's moved to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' location.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Model deployment change from Anthropic Claude to GPT-4.1 may affect agent behavior and output quality.",7,10
deductions,risk,"Removal of EMR-Glue specific context may lead to less optimized code generation for AWS environments.",9,11
deductions,ambiguity,"Workflow ID values differ significantly (8578 vs 1858) suggesting these may represent different workflow instances rather than versions.",2,3
deductions,general_finding,"Overall assessment: Moderate schema evolution with preserved core functionality but reduced AWS-specific optimization and some structural breaking changes.",0,0
