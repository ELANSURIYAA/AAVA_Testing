deductions,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced governance through agent IDs and improved model versioning while preserving core semantic meaning. The structural changes represent a modernization effort with some backward compatibility concerns.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent workflow for SSIS to PySpark documentation and analysis. Business logic and agent responsibilities remain semantically identical.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_SSIS_Documentation maintains identical task description and expected outputs across both versions, preserving documentation generation semantics.",8,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer retains same analytical framework and complexity metrics calculation logic in both versions.",32,32
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Plan preserves cost estimation and effort planning methodology across versions.",65,65
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflowId/workflowName structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' representing improved semantic clarity for agent-centric workflows.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent structure evolution: AAVA 1.0 uses agentName/model/tools/task hierarchy while AAVA 2.0 flattens to agentId/name/modelDeploymentName/description/toolReferences.",8,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task description relocation: Moved from nested task.description in v1 to top-level description in v2, reducing nesting depth.",10,10
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from workflowId (960) to workFlowDetail.id (2625). Values differ but semantic meaning preserved.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name evolved from workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with slight formatting change: 'DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Doc&Analyze' vs 'DI SSIS to PySpark Doc&Analyze'.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container field renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' improving semantic clarity and domain alignment.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent name field renamed from 'agentName' to 'name' following standard naming conventions.",8,9
deductions,field_change,"Model reference enhanced from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",9,11
deductions,field_change,"Tools field restructured from empty 'tools' array to 'toolReferences' array maintaining same empty state.",10,13
deductions,field_change,"Task structure flattened: task.description moved to top-level description field reducing JSON nesting.",11,12
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID data type preserved as integer but value changed from 960 to 2625.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Agent identification enhanced with introduction of agentId field (7359, 7348, 7347) providing unique agent tracking capability absent in v1.",8,8
deductions,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agent IDs improving traceability and governance but creates potential backward compatibility issues for systems expecting v1 structure.",8,8
deductions,governance_issue,"Model versioning improved from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' but may impact systems with hardcoded model references.",9,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"JSON schema evolution represents modernization with improved semantic clarity but requires migration planning for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Structural flattening of task descriptions improves readability but changes JSON path references from task.description to description.",11,12
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Systems parsing workflowId and workflowName directly will fail with v2 structure requiring code updates.",2,2
deductions,risk,"Agent parsing risk: Systems expecting 'nodes' array and 'agentName' fields will require structural updates for v2 compatibility.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Model reference risk: Hardcoded 'gpt-4' model references may fail with 'gpt-4.1' upgrade requiring configuration updates.",9,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with proper nesting and consistent field types throughout.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types: workflowId (integer), workflowName (string), nodes (array).",2,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Agent structure consistent across all three agents with identical field schema and proper task nesting.",8,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Task descriptions contain complete and well-formed content with proper formatting and placeholders.",11,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with improved organization and consistent field naming.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"WorkFlowDetail object properly structured with id and name fields maintaining data integrity.",2,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Agent IDs properly assigned as integers (7359, 7348, 7347) providing unique identification.",8,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Model deployment names consistently formatted as 'gpt-4.1' across all agents.",11,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while other fields use camelCase, creating slight naming convention variance.",2,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical business logic and functional requirements for SSIS to PySpark conversion workflow.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents a structural modernization effort with enhanced governance capabilities while preserving core functionality.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Migration from v1 to v2 requires systematic updates to dependent systems but offers improved maintainability and traceability.",1,1
