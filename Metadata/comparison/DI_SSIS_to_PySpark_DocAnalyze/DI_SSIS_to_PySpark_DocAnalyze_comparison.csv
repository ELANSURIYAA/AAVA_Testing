deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been reorganized from a flat nodes array to a hierarchical structure with enhanced metadata tracking. Agent definitions remain functionally equivalent but with expanded identification and deployment information.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose (DI SSIS to PySpark documentation and analysis) is preserved across both versions with identical business objectives and agent responsibilities.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent task descriptions are semantically identical between versions, maintaining the same documentation requirements, analysis criteria, and planning specifications.",8,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization from flat 'nodes' array (AAVA 1.0) to nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure (AAVA 2.0).",3,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Introduction of hierarchical workflow metadata with dedicated workflow detail section containing id and name fields.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with enhanced nesting structure.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) maintaining semantic equivalence.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field 'agentName' (line 8) renamed to 'name' (line 12) within agent context for simplified naming.",8,12
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 9) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 13) providing more specific deployment context.",9,13
deduction,field_change,"Field 'tools' (line 10) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 95) with semantic enhancement for reference clarity.",10,95
deduction,field_change,"Field 'task' (line 11) restructured into 'description' (line 14) with task content embedded directly.",11,14
deduction,type_change,"Agent structure evolved from task object with nested description to direct description field containing full task specification.",11,14

deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced model deployment specification from simple 'gpt-4' to versioned 'gpt-4.1' indicating deployment evolution.",9,13

deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of structured task object in favor of embedded description reduces metadata granularity for task management.",11,14
deduction,governance_issue,"Flattening of expectedOutput specification into description field may impact automated task validation capabilities.",50,14
deduction,ambiguity,"Model version evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' may indicate deployment changes requiring validation of compatibility.",9,13
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization may require updates to dependent systems expecting flat nodes array structure.",3,6
deduction,risk,"Field name changes require mapping logic for systems transitioning from AAVA 1.0 to AAVA 2.0 field references.",8,12
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve all core functionality with enhanced organization in AAVA 2.0.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Task content preservation is complete with identical documentation requirements, analysis specifications, and planning criteria.",12,15
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces better separation of concerns with dedicated workflow metadata and enhanced agent identification.",1,2
