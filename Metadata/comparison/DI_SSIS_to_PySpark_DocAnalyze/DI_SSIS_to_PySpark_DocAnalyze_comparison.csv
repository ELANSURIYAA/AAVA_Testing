deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical organization and enhanced metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning. The transformation shows clear schema evolution with improved governance structure but introduces some backward compatibility concerns.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"All three agents (DI_SSIS_Documentation, DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer, DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Plan) maintain identical semantic purpose and task descriptions between versions.",4,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Workflow name preserved with minor formatting change: 'DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Doc&Analyze' remains consistent in meaning.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions and expected outputs are semantically identical, indicating preserved business logic and requirements.",8,12
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: flat 'nodes' array replaced with hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure.",4,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Field renaming: 'workflowId' (line 2) becomes nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3), 'workflowName' becomes 'workFlowDetail.name'.",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent structure enhanced: 'agentName' renamed to 'name', 'model' becomes 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade.",5,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"New metadata fields added: 'agentId' for unique identification and 'toolReferences' array for tool management.",5,18
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure simplified: 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' flattened to single 'description' field.",8,12
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification: 'agentName' field renamed to 'name' across all agents.",5,9
deductions,field_change,"Model specification: 'model' field renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",6,10
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identification: 'workflowId' moved from root level to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' structure.",2,3
deductions,type_change,"Model version upgrade: All agents upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating platform evolution.",6,10
deductions,constraint_change,"Task structure constraint change: 'expectedOutput' field removed, consolidating requirements into 'description' field only.",8,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' specifications may impact validation and quality assurance processes.",8,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Removal of 'tools' array structure replaced with 'toolReferences' but content preservation unclear.",7,18
deductions,governance_issue,"Task specification consolidation may reduce clarity between task description and expected deliverables.",8,12
deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of 'agentId' field suggests move toward unique agent identification and improved referential integrity.",5,8
deductions,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical workflow organization indicates evolution toward more structured metadata governance.",2,2

deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types (integers, strings, arrays, objects).",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"No orphaned references or broken internal consistency detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced hierarchical structure.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: 'workFlowDetail' uses camelCase while 'workflowAgents' uses different casing pattern.",2,6
deductions,correctness_aava2,"All agent references properly structured with consistent field usage.",8,
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting flat 'nodes' array.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Data loss risk: 'expectedOutput' field removal may impact downstream validation processes.",8,12
deductions,risk,"Integration risk: Field renames require updates to all dependent systems and APIs.",5,9
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear mapping between 'tools' array in v1 and 'toolReferences' array in v2 - relationship not explicitly defined.",7,18
deductions,ambiguity,"Agent versioning strategy unclear - impact of model upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 on existing workflows.",6,10
