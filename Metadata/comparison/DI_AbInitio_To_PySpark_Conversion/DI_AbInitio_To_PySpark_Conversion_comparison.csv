deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with moderate schema evolution and structural reorganization. Both versions define a DI AbInitio to PySpark conversion workflow with 5 agents but with significant naming and structural changes.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a data integration workflow for converting AbInitio to PySpark with the same fundamental purpose and agent responsibilities.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent semantic alignment: All 5 agents maintain their core functional purpose - converter, unit tester, conversion tester, recon tester, and reviewer - with preserved business meaning.",4,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure, increasing hierarchy depth.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructuring: AAVA 1.0 uses 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 uses 'workflowAgents' array with different internal structure.",4,4
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID field: workflowId (2727) in v1 vs id (1896) in workFlowDetail in v2. Values differ significantly.",3,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name evolution: workflowName 'DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Conversion' vs name 'DI AbInitio To PySpark Conversion' with spacing differences.",4,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming convention: 'agentName' in v1 becomes 'name' in v2, losing the explicit 'agent' prefix.",6,6
deductions,field_change,"Model specification evolution: 'model' field in v1 becomes 'modelDeploymentName' in v2 with different values (anthropic.claude-4-sonnet vs gpt-4.1).",7,7
deductions,structural_change,"Agent ID introduction: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3624, 3643, 3645, 3655, 3672) not present in v1.",5,5
deductions,structural_change,"Tools array transformation: v1 'tools' array with string values becomes v2 'toolReferences' empty array, indicating architectural change.",8,8
deductions,structural_change,"Task object flattening: v1 nested task.description becomes v2 flat description field, reducing nesting depth.",9,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Missing task structure: AAVA 2.0 removes the task object wrapper and expectedOutput field present in v1.",10,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degradation: v2 removes expectedOutput descriptions that provided important context about agent deliverables.",11,11
deductions,type_change,"Tool reference type change: String array 'tools' in v1 vs empty array 'toolReferences' in v2 suggests different tool management approach.",8,8
deductions,naming_convention,"Inconsistent field naming: workFlowDetail uses camelCase 'workFlowDetail' but contains 'name' field, mixing conventions.",2,2
deductions,schema_evolution,"Agent structure evolution: Significant restructuring from task-oriented to deployment-oriented agent definitions.",5,15
deductions,risk,"Breaking change impact: Field name changes and structural reorganization will require updates to dependent systems and APIs.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Data migration complexity: Different ID values and structural changes require careful mapping during version migration.",3,3
deductions,ambiguity,"Tool reference ambiguity: Empty toolReferences arrays in v2 unclear whether tools are deprecated or moved elsewhere.",8,8
deductions,general_finding,"JSON syntax validation: Both versions are syntactically valid JSON with proper structure and no parsing errors.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Content preservation: All agent descriptions maintain identical detailed task specifications ensuring functional continuity.",9,9
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow integrity: Despite structural changes, the logical workflow sequence and agent relationships are preserved.",1,15
