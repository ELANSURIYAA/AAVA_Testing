deduction,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and agent-specific identifiers while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains its purpose of Azure Synapse to Databricks conversion with documentation and analysis capabilities.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define identical workflow purpose: DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Databricks_DeclarativeSQL_Doc&Analyze. The business logic for Azure Synapse to Databricks conversion remains consistent across versions.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Synapse_Documentation maintains identical task descriptions and expected outputs in both versions. Core documentation requirements preserved.",8,11
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Databricks_DeclarativeSQL_Analyzer shows identical task descriptions focusing on complexity metrics and syntax analysis.",37,42
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Databricks_DeclarativeSQL_Plan maintains consistent conversion planning objectives across both versions.",66,71
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId (integer) and workflowName (string) at root level.",2,
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object containing id and name properties, increasing structural depth.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 1.0 uses simple nodes array containing agent objects directly.",4,
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 restructures to workflowAgents array with enhanced agent metadata including agentId and modelDeploymentName.",6,
deduction,field_change,"workflowId renamed to workFlowDetail.id. Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name. Maintains same string value but nested under new structure.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents. Semantic purpose identical but naming convention updated.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"agentName property renamed to name within agent objects. Maintains same string values.",6,9
deduction,type_change,"model property changed to modelDeploymentName with version suffix (.1 added to gpt-4). Indicates deployment-specific model versioning.",7,10
deduction,constraint_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId as unique identifier for each agent, adding referential integrity.",8,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 adds toolReferences array property to each agent, currently empty but indicates future extensibility.",11,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 shows valid JSON syntax with consistent property naming and proper nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"All agent task descriptions are properly escaped and formatted as valid JSON strings.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Workflow structure maintains logical consistency with clear agent-to-task relationships.",4,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 contains JSON syntax error: unescaped quotes in task descriptions causing parsing issues.",42,42
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Multiple instances of unescaped quotation marks within description strings break JSON validity.",11,42
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Despite syntax issues, logical structure and agent relationships remain internally consistent.",6,
deduction,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId but lacks documentation on ID assignment strategy or uniqueness constraints.",8,
deduction,governance_issue,"modelDeploymentName versioning (.1 suffix) lacks clear versioning policy documentation.",10,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat to nested structure (workFlowDetail) improves organization but requires accessor updates.",2,3
deduction,schema_evolution,"Addition of agentId enables better agent tracking and referential integrity in downstream systems.",8,8
deduction,schema_evolution,"toolReferences array addition provides extensibility for future tool integration capabilities.",11,
deduction,risk,"JSON syntax errors in AAVA 2.0 will cause parsing failures in downstream systems expecting valid JSON.",42,42
deduction,risk,"Structural changes require updates to all systems accessing workflow metadata through original property paths.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Model versioning changes may impact API calls expecting exact model names without deployment suffixes.",7,10
deduction,ambiguity,"agentId assignment methodology unclear - could be sequential, UUID-based, or domain-specific.",8,8
deduction,ambiguity,"toolReferences purpose and expected schema undefined in current implementation.",11,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical core business logic for Azure Synapse to Databricks conversion workflows.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents architectural evolution toward more structured metadata management.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain byte-for-byte identical across versions, ensuring functional consistency.",8,11
