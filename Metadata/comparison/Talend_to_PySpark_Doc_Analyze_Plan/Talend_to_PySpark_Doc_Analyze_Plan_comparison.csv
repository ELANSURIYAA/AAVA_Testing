deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow detail restructuring and agent configuration modifications. Critical governance degradation observed with removal of task specifications and expected output definitions.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a Talend to PySpark documentation and analysis pipeline with three agents performing documentation, analysis, and planning functions.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: Documentation agent creates Talend job documentation, Analyzer agent performs complexity analysis, Plan agent provides effort estimation.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow properties (workflowId, workflowName) while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object structure.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Array naming evolution: 'nodes' array in v1 renamed to 'workflowAgents' in v2, indicating conceptual shift from generic nodes to specialized agent entities.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from workflowId (1454) to workFlowDetail.id (4134). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location modified.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name changed from workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with minor textual variation: 'Talend_to_PySpark_Doc_Analyze_Plan' vs 'Talend to PySpark Doc Analyze Plan'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification evolved from agentName to name field, maintaining semantic equivalence but changing structural reference.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification changed from 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' with value evolution from 'gpt-4o' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Agent configuration structure fundamentally altered: v1 uses task object with description/expectedOutput, v2 uses flat description field.",8,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Critical metadata loss: expectedOutput field completely removed in v2, eliminating structured output specifications for all agents.",8,
deduction,constraint_change,"Task structure eliminated: v2 removes nested task object containing description and expectedOutput, flattening to single description field.",8,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tools configuration modified: v1 uses empty tools array, v2 uses toolReferences array, indicating architectural shift in tool management.",9,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Agent identification enhancement: v2 introduces agentId field (5470, 5313, 5474) providing unique numeric identifiers absent in v1.",6,7
deduction,governance_issue,"Significant governance degradation: removal of expectedOutput specifications reduces metadata completeness and eliminates structured output contracts.",8,
deduction,governance_issue,"Task specification loss impacts workflow documentation quality and reduces clarity of agent responsibilities and deliverables.",8,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from component-based (nodes) to agent-based (workflowAgents) terminology reflects architectural maturation.",4,6
deduction,schema_evolution,"Workflow detail encapsulation in v2 suggests improved data modeling with logical grouping of workflow properties.",2,2
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates excellent JSON syntax validity with consistent structure and complete metadata specifications.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types: integer IDs, string names, structured task objects.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Task objects properly structured with both description and expectedOutput fields maintaining metadata completeness.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 maintains valid JSON syntax with proper object nesting and array structures.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while workflowAgents uses different casing pattern.",2,6
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Structural integrity maintained despite architectural changes, with all references properly formed.",6,
deduction,risk,"Breaking change risk: removal of expectedOutput field may impact downstream systems expecting structured output specifications.",8,
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility concern: structural changes in workflow identification and agent configuration may require system updates.",2,6
deduction,risk,"Governance degradation risk: reduced metadata completeness may impact data quality and system documentation standards.",8,
deduction,ambiguity,"Model version evolution from 'gpt-4o' to 'gpt-4.1' may indicate capability changes requiring validation of processing compatibility.",7,9
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool management architectural shift from tools array to toolReferences requires clarification of implementation differences.",9,11
deduction,general_finding,"Overall assessment indicates controlled evolution with preserved semantic meaning but significant structural modernization.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Migration complexity moderate due to structural changes but semantic preservation enables systematic transformation.",1,1
