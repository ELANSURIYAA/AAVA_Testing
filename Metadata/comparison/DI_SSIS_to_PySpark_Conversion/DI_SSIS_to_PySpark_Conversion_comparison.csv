deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow for SSIS to PySpark conversion but with significant structural reorganization and enhanced agent modeling. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more sophisticated metadata architecture while preserving core functionality.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains identical - converting SSIS packages to PySpark code with comprehensive testing and review processes. All five agent roles are preserved with equivalent functionality.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workFlowDetail wrapper and restructures agent metadata from simple nodes array to workflowAgents with enhanced attributes including agentId and modelDeploymentName.",3,2
deduction,field_change,"Root level workflowId (961) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2598) - indicates workflow evolution or different instance",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root level workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with slight formatting change from 'DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion' to 'DI SSIS to PySpark Conversion'",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure including agentId field and modelDeploymentName replacing simple model field",4,5
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming convention changed from agentName to name field in AAVA 2.0",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification evolved from simple 'gpt-4' string to structured 'gpt-4.1' in modelDeploymentName field",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools array replaced with toolReferences array structure in AAVA 2.0, maintaining empty arrays but with different naming convention",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Task structure completely flattened in AAVA 2.0 - description moved to agent level, expectedOutput removed entirely",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata in AAVA 2.0 reduces workflow documentation and governance quality",15,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All five agent descriptions remain functionally identical with same instructions, scope, and technical requirements preserved",10,10
deduction,correctness_analysis,"Both JSON structures are syntactically valid with proper nesting, no orphaned references, and consistent data types throughout",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant schema evolution with enhanced agent modeling but potential backward compatibility challenges",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may require updates to dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format, particularly around task.expectedOutput field removal",1,1
deduction,risk,"Agent ID introduction (7159, 7151, 7142, 7141, 7060) suggests database-backed agent management requiring system integration updates",1,6
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow ID change from 961 to 2598 indicates this may be different workflow instances rather than pure version evolution",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform-wide model enhancement",7,9
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether workFlowDetail wrapper provides additional metadata or is purely structural reorganization",1,2
deduction,ambiguity,"toolReferences array purpose unclear - may indicate future tool integration capability not present in AAVA 1.0",8,10
