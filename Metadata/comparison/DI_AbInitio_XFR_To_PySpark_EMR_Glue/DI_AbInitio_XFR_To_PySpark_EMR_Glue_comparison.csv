deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same core workflow concept (Ab Initio to PySpark transformation) but with significant structural reorganization and model changes. AAVA 2.0 introduces breaking changes in JSON schema while preserving semantic meaning.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core business purpose remains identical: converting Ab Initio XFR files to PySpark functions. Task descriptions align semantically with minor variations in implementation details.",8,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural changes: workflowId/workflowName (v1) vs workFlowDetail object (v2), nodes array (v1) vs workflowAgents array (v2). Schema evolution introduces breaking changes.",2,2
deductions,field_change,"Field workflowId (8567) in v1 replaced by workFlowDetail.id (1857) in v2. Different identifier values suggest different workflow instances.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field workflowName in v1 replaced by workFlowDetail.name in v2. Structural change from flat to nested property.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array name changed from 'nodes' in v1 to 'workflowAgents' in v2. More descriptive naming but breaks backward compatibility.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent property 'agentName' in v1 changed to 'name' in v2. Simplified naming convention.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Model changed from 'anthropic.claude-4-sonnet' in v1 to 'gpt-4.1' in v2. Represents different AI model deployment.",7,10
deductions,field_change,"Property 'model' in v1 changed to 'modelDeploymentName' in v2. More descriptive field name.",7,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure remains nested object in both versions but content organization differs. V1 has more detailed step-by-step instructions.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools array empty in v1, replaced by 'toolReferences' array in v2. Naming convention change for tool management.",8,13
deductions,governance_issue,"V2 introduces agentId field (3621) not present in v1, adding agent identification capability.",0,7
deductions,governance_issue,"V1 includes more detailed EMR/Glue specific requirements in task description, potentially better for governance.",8,11
deductions,type_change,"Workflow identification changed from simple integer workflowId to complex workFlowDetail object. Impacts data access patterns.",2,2
deductions,correctness_aava1,"JSON syntax valid. All references consistent. No orphaned objects detected. Internal structure logically sound.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"JSON syntax valid. Minor inconsistency in camelCase convention (workFlowDetail vs workflowAgents). Otherwise structurally sound.",0,2
deductions,schema_evolution,"Breaking schema changes require migration strategy. Field mappings not 1:1 compatible between versions.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Renamed root-level properties break backward compatibility for dependent systems expecting v1 schema structure.",2,2
deductions,risk,"Different model deployments (Claude vs GPT-4) may produce different transformation outputs affecting downstream consistency.",7,10
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear if workFlowDetail.id (1857) and workflowId (8567) represent same logical workflow or different instances.",2,3
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain core transformation logic requirements but v2 provides more structured agent management approach.",1,1
