deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The migration introduces enhanced organization patterns and naming conventions but maintains functional equivalence for all agent definitions and task descriptions.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All five agents maintain identical core functionality and task descriptions between versions. Agent purposes and business logic remain semantically equivalent despite structural reorganization.",4,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical organization with workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure. This represents architectural improvement but breaks backward compatibility.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 392 to 4535. Semantic meaning preserved but identifier updated.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value change from 'DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Conversion' to 'DI INFA To PySpark Conversion'. Semantic meaning preserved with minor formatting difference.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"nodes array (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved with improved naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8) within agent objects. Semantic meaning preserved with simplified naming.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'. Represents version upgrade while preserving semantic meaning.",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (line 7) as new unique identifier for agents, enhancing referential integrity. This is a structural improvement not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"tools array (line 8) replaced with toolReferences array (line 11) in AAVA 2.0. Both are empty arrays but naming suggests architectural shift toward reference-based tool management.",8,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 flattens task structure by moving description directly under agent object (line 10) rather than nested under task object. This simplifies hierarchy while preserving content.",9,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes expectedOutput field that was present in AAVA 1.0 task objects. This represents metadata degradation as expected output specifications are lost.",12,0
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 metadata is syntactically valid JSON with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 metadata is syntactically valid JSON with consistent internal structure. Minor issue: missing expectedOutput field reduces metadata completeness compared to v1.",0,1
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata in AAVA 2.0 reduces governance quality as output specifications are no longer explicitly documented for each agent.",0,0
deduction,schema_evolution,"The migration represents controlled schema evolution with improved organization (workFlowDetail hierarchy) and enhanced referential integrity (agentId) while maintaining semantic equivalence.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format. Field renames and hierarchy changes require migration scripts for backward compatibility.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral differences in agent execution despite semantic equivalence in task definitions.",7,9
deduction,ambiguity,"toolReferences vs tools naming suggests architectural shift but both are empty arrays making actual functional difference unclear without additional context.",8,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent task descriptions remain identical between versions indicating successful preservation of business logic during structural migration.",0,0
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow identifier change from 392 to 4535 suggests this represents a new workflow version rather than in-place migration of existing workflow.",2,3
