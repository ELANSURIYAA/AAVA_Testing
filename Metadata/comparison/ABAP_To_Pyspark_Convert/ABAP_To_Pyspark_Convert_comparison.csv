deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and standardized model deployment. Key changes include field restructuring, ID migration, and model version upgrades.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow functionality preserved: ABAP to PySpark conversion pipeline with identical agent purposes and task descriptions. Business logic and processing steps remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. Root-level workflow metadata moved from flat structure (workflowId, workflowName) to nested object (workFlowDetail). Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents'.",2,2
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Value changed from 1402 to 4100 indicating workflow migration.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value changed from 'ABAP_To_Pyspark_Convert' to 'ABAP To Pyspark Convert' (spacing normalized).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Structural purpose preserved but naming convention updated.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' across all agents. Semantic meaning preserved.",8,10
deductions,field_change,"Field 'model' renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with standardization to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents (previously mixed: o3-mini, gpt-4o).",9,11
deductions,type_change,"Agent identification changed from implicit array index to explicit 'agentId' field with unique numeric identifiers (5434, 4473, 5414, 5091, 4630).",7,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools field restructured from empty array 'tools: []' to 'toolReferences: []' indicating enhanced tool management architecture.",10,13
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure preserved with identical descriptions across all 5 agents. Complex multi-step processing logic maintained without degradation.",11,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Model deployment standardization to 'gpt-4.1' improves consistency but may impact backward compatibility for systems expecting specific model versions.",9,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 follows enterprise metadata management patterns with improved normalization and explicit ID management.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Workflow ID change from 1402 to 4100 may break external system references and lineage tracking tools.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Model standardization to gpt-4.1 may affect cost calculations and performance characteristics compared to mixed model deployment in v1.0.",9,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper structure. All required fields present and well-formed.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure. All fields properly nested and typed.",1,
deductions,general_finding,"Agent count preserved (5 agents) with identical functional roles: Converter, Unit Testing, Conversion Tester, Recon Tester, Reviewer.",4,6
deductions,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain character-for-character identical preserving business logic and processing requirements.",11,12
deductions,general_finding,"Expected output formats maintained across all agents ensuring downstream system compatibility.",50,60
