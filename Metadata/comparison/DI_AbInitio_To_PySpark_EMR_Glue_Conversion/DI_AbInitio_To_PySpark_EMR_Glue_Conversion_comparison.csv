deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and enhanced metadata governance. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more hierarchical structure while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a DI AbInitio to PySpark EMR Glue conversion workflow with identical agent purposes and transformation logic.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure with enhanced metadata.",3,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value also changed from technical name to human-readable format.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured: 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) with enhanced agent metadata including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) remains consistent across both versions, preserving agent identity.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'model' field (line 7) evolved from simple string to 'modelDeploymentName' with updated values (e.g., 'anthropic.claude-4-sonnet' to 'gpt-4.1').",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools array structure preserved: 'tools' field (line 8) maintains empty array structure in both versions, indicating consistent tool configuration.",8,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure preserved: 'task' object (line 9) maintains identical nested structure with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' fields across both versions.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Agent descriptions remain identical between versions, indicating no content evolution or improvement in agent specifications.",10,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"New metadata fields introduced in AAVA 2.0: 'agentId' provides unique identification, 'toolReferences' replaces 'tools' array for better referential integrity.",,-1
deduction,constraint_change,"ID value changed: workflowId changed from 8576 to 8480, potentially indicating different workflow instances or versioning scheme.",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper structure, consistent field types, and no broken references.",1,-1
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure, proper nesting, and consistent field types throughout.",1,-1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact dependent systems expecting flat 'nodes' array structure, requiring code updates for field access patterns.",,-1
deduction,risk,"Model deployment name changes could affect system configurations expecting specific model identifiers.",,-1
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain complete agent task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional equivalence despite structural differences.",,-1
deduction,general_finding,"Enhanced metadata in AAVA 2.0 provides better governance capabilities with agent IDs and structured tool references.",,-1
