deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow configuration has been reorganized with improved naming conventions and enhanced agent modeling. However, structural changes introduce compatibility risks and some metadata completeness degradation.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core business functionality remains identical - both versions define a DI DataMapping Recommender workflow for mapping legacy v10 fields to modern v12 schema. Task descriptions and instructions are preserved verbatim.",1,1
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow structure with nodes array, while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workFlowDetail object and workflowAgents array.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value changed from 'DI_DataMapping_Recommender' to 'DI DataMapping Recommender' (underscore to space).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Structural reorganization with enhanced agent modeling.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) within agent object. Simplified naming convention.",6,8
deductions,type_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value change from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'. Indicates model version upgrade.",7,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task object structure (lines 10-13 in AAVA 1.0) flattened into agent-level description field (line 10 in AAVA 2.0). Task.expectedOutput field completely removed.",10,10
deductions,missing_metadata,"Field 'expectedOutput' present in AAVA 1.0 (line 13) completely removed in AAVA 2.0. This represents metadata completeness degradation.",13,
deductions,field_change,"Tools array 'tools' (line 8) replaced with empty 'toolReferences' array (line 11). Tool specification method changed from direct listing to reference-based approach.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper nesting, consistent types, and logical field relationships. No structural inconsistencies detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper nesting and consistent types. Enhanced object modeling with workFlowDetail hierarchy.",1,
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a schema evolution toward more structured agent modeling with hierarchical workflow details and reference-based tool specification.",1,1
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput field reduces metadata completeness and may impact downstream systems expecting output specifications.",13,
deductions,risk,"Structural reorganization from nodes to workflowAgents may break existing parsers and integration tools expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Model version change from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral differences in agent execution.",7,9
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences array in AAVA 2.0 creates ambiguity about actual tool availability compared to explicit tools array in AAVA 1.0.",8,11
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical core task descriptions and instructions, ensuring functional equivalence despite structural changes.",10,10
deductions,general_finding,"Naming convention improvements in AAVA 2.0 (workFlowDetail, modelDeploymentName) enhance clarity and follow modern API design patterns.",2,3
