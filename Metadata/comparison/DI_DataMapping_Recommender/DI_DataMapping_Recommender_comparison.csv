deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces architectural changes while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural reorganization affects backward compatibility.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality remain semantically identical. Both versions describe DI DataMapping Recommender with same business logic and requirements.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent description content is identical between versions maintaining semantic consistency for business requirements.",15,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task instructions and output format requirements are preserved ensuring functional equivalence.",16,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root level structure changed from workflowId/workflowName to nested workFlowDetail object representing architectural evolution.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array indicating conceptual shift from generic nodes to specific agent entities.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent structure flattened - task object eliminated with description moved directly to agent level.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model field renamed from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' suggesting deployment-specific naming convention.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (numeric 5907) replaced by workFlowDetail.id (numeric 2096) - different identifier but same semantic purpose.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName string replaced by workFlowDetail.name with slight formatting difference ('DI_DataMapping_Recommender' vs 'DI DataMapping Recommender').",3,4
deductions,field_change,"agentName field removed in favor of name field at agent level - semantic equivalence maintained.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"tools array replaced by toolReferences array - structural change with semantic preservation.",8,12
deductions,type_change,"Model deployment reference changed from simple string 'gpt-4' to versioned string 'gpt-4.1' indicating version evolution.",7,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Task object structure eliminated - expectedOutput field completely removed reducing metadata completeness.",17,
deductions,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput field missing in AAVA 2.0 reduces specification completeness and governance quality.",17,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tools specification changed from explicit array ['FileWriterTool'] to empty toolReferences array reducing implementation clarity.",8,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Workflow ID changed from 5907 to 2096 without clear migration mapping potentially breaking dependent systems.",2,3
deductions,governance_issue,"Agent ID introduced (3900) in v2.0 without corresponding field in v1.0 creating new dependency.",7,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of agentId field suggests evolution toward agent-centric architecture.",7,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Nested workFlowDetail structure indicates move toward more structured workflow metadata.",2,
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting v1.0 node-based structure.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Missing expectedOutput specification may impact automated validation and testing frameworks.",17,
deductions,risk,"Empty toolReferences array may indicate incomplete migration or loss of tool specification.",8,12
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper structure and no broken references.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required fields are present and properly typed with consistent internal structure.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper structure and no broken references.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"New structure is internally consistent though some metadata completeness is reduced.",1,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical core business logic and functional requirements ensuring migration feasibility.",15,8
deductions,general_finding,"Architectural evolution suggests movement toward more sophisticated workflow management system.",2,2
