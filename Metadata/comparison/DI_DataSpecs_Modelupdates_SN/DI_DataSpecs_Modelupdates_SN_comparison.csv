deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been enhanced with improved organization and additional metadata fields. Key changes include workflow identification restructuring, agent definition improvements, and enhanced model deployment specifications.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality remain semantically equivalent between versions. The DI DataSpecs Modelupdates workflow maintains the same three-agent structure with identical business objectives.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization observed. AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflowId/workflowName structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId renamed to workFlowDetail.id. Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from nodes to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata structure including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field agentName renamed to name. Core identification preserved.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model field changed from model to modelDeploymentName with version specification enhancement (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools array restructured from simple string array to toolReferences array. AAVA 1.0 shows tools as strings while AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays.",8,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference structure change may impact downstream tool integration and dependency management systems.",8,10
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification enhanced with addition of agentId numeric field in AAVA 2.0 providing unique agent identification.",6,8
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical organization.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced organization and additional metadata fields.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a minor version upgrade with backward compatibility concerns due to structural field access changes.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Renamed fields (workflowId to workFlowDetail.id, agentName to name) may break existing API integrations and data access patterns.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tools array restructuring from strings to toolReferences objects requires downstream system updates for tool dependency resolution.",8,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 suggest either incomplete migration or architectural change in tool management approach.",8,10
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform enhancement while maintaining compatibility.",7,9
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain identical between versions indicating stable functional requirements.",9,11
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output specifications preserved exactly maintaining downstream processing compatibility.",50,50
deduction,governance_issue,"Workflow name formatting inconsistency: AAVA 1.0 uses underscores while AAVA 2.0 uses spaces, impacting naming convention standards.",3,4
