deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include nested workflow details and flattened agent definitions.",,
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN represents the same business process in both versions. All three agents maintain identical functional descriptions and purposes.",2,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical task description and output format requirements across both versions.",6,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete functional specification for model evolution analysis.",42,26
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains comprehensive test case generation requirements.",43,49
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root structure reorganized: flat workflowId/workflowName replaced with nested workFlowDetail object containing id/name properties.",1,2
