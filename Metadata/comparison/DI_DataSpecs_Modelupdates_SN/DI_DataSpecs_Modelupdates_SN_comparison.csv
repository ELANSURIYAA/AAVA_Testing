deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose but introduces enhanced data modeling with improved agent identification and tool management. Key changes include structural reorganization from flat node arrays to hierarchical workflowAgents structure and enhanced metadata fields.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN workflow with identical core business functionality. All three agents maintain their essential purposes: technical specification creation, delta model changes, and functional test case generation.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural improvements with hierarchical organization under workFlowDetail and workflowAgents containers, replacing the flat nodes array structure of AAVA 1.0.",3,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with enhanced formatting from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Nodes array (line 4) replaced with workflowAgents array (line 6) providing enhanced agent metadata structure",4,6
deduction,field_addition,"Agent identification enhanced with agentId field (line 8) added in AAVA 2.0 for improved tracking",0,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent name field agentName (line 5) renamed to name (line 9) with consistent naming convention",5,9
deduction,field_change,"Model field (line 6) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 10) with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1",6,10
deduction,field_change,"Task field (line 8) renamed to description (line 11) for improved clarity and metadata governance",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Tools array (line 7) renamed to toolReferences (line 85) with structural change from string array to object references",7,85
deduction,structural_change,"Task.description and task.expectedOutput fields consolidated into single description field in AAVA 2.0",9,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference structure changed from simple string array to empty object array, potentially impacting tool integration",7,85
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID data type maintained as integer but value updated from 1594 to 2147 indicating version progression",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent structure flattened in AAVA 2.0 removing nested task object and promoting description to top level",8,11

deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 maintains excellent JSON syntax validity with enhanced structural organization and consistent field typing",0,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a major version upgrade with breaking changes in field naming and structural organization",0,0
deduction,risk,"Field renaming without alias mapping may impact downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 field names",0,0
deduction,risk,"Tool reference structure change from string array to empty object array requires validation of tool integration compatibility",7,85
deduction,ambiguity,"Task consolidation in AAVA 2.0 may result in loss of granular task vs expected output distinction",8,11
