deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization through nested objects and additional metadata fields while preserving core business meaning. However structural changes impact backward compatibility and some metadata completeness issues exist.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a data integration workflow for DataSpecs Model updates with three sequential agents for technical specification generation delta model changes and functional test case creation.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same business objectives across versions.",4,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object containing id and name properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: nodes array in AAVA 1.0 becomes workflowAgents array in AAVA 2.0 with enhanced agent metadata structure.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier evolution: workflowId (1594) becomes workFlowDetail.id (2147) indicating workflow instance change.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name formatting: workflowName changes from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN (underscore to space conversion).",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming standardization: agentName property renamed to name across all agent definitions.",6,10
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhancement: model field (gpt-4) becomes modelDeploymentName (gpt-4.1) indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",7,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification enhancement: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3885 3474 3545) for unique agent identification absent in AAVA 1.0.",9,9
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool reference structure change: tools array containing tool names in AAVA 1.0 becomes empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0.",8,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure degradation: expectedOutput field present in all AAVA 1.0 agents completely removed in AAVA 2.0 reducing metadata completeness.",10,13
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates strong internal consistency with complete task definitions including both description and expectedOutput for all three agents.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Tool references properly defined: DI_Github_File_Writer_Z tool correctly specified for first agent with empty arrays for others.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 maintains valid JSON structure with enhanced metadata organization through nested objects and unique agent identifiers.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Incomplete tool metadata: all toolReferences arrays are empty despite agents likely requiring tools based on task descriptions.",12,
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness regression: removal of expectedOutput fields reduces documentation quality and task specification clarity in AAVA 2.0.",10,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version evolution pattern: AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with breaking changes requiring migration logic for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility impact: structural changes from flat to nested organization will break existing parsers and integration systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Tool configuration ambiguity: empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may cause runtime failures if agents expect tool availability based on task requirements.",8,12
deduction,ambiguity,"Model deployment naming: transition from model to modelDeploymentName suggests deployment-specific configuration but lacks clear versioning strategy documentation.",7,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent task descriptions remain identical across versions maintaining functional specification consistency despite structural changes.",15,14
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow evolution indicates system maturation with enhanced metadata organization and unique identification capabilities in AAVA 2.0.",1,1
