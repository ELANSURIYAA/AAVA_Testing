deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and additional metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow detail reorganization and agent metadata enhancement.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN preserved across both versions with identical business purpose and agent functionality.",3,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical semantic purpose and task descriptions.",6,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflowId/workflowName structure, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array structure changed from nodes to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",6,7
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (1594) moved from root level to nested workFlowDetail.id (2147) - values differ indicating version evolution.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName changed to workFlowDetail.name with slight formatting difference: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' improving semantic clarity.",6,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' for consistency.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Model field changed from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade: 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Tools field renamed from 'tools' to 'toolReferences' and structure changed from array of strings to array of objects (empty in current data).",9,11
deduction,type_change,"Tools field type changed from string array to object array, indicating enhanced tool metadata capability.",9,11
deduction,constraint_change,"New required field 'agentId' added to each agent in AAVA 2.0 (values: 3885, 3474, 3545).",7,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes 'task' wrapper object, moving description and expectedOutput to agent root level.",11,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Task structure flattened in AAVA 2.0 - 'task.description' becomes 'description' and 'task.expectedOutput' removed entirely.",11,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications completely removed in AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata completeness for governance.",12,12
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization may break existing parsers expecting AAVA 1.0 flat structure.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool reference structure change from string array to object array requires parser updates.",9,11
deduction,risk,"Removal of expectedOutput field reduces traceability and validation capabilities.",12,12
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor version evolution with backward compatibility concerns due to structural changes.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions for all three agents, preserving functional requirements.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent (3 agents) with same functional roles across versions.",6,7
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow naming convention slightly modified with space formatting changes.",3,4
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,ambiguity,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates capability enhancement but may affect behavior consistency.",8,10
