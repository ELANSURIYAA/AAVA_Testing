deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and removes some metadata fields while maintaining core semantic meaning. The evolution shows improved data modeling practices but introduces breaking changes that affect backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical business purpose and agent functionality. The core semantic meaning is preserved across the evolution.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural changes: workflow metadata moved to nested workFlowDetail object, nodes renamed to workflowAgents, and agent structure completely reorganized.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowId (1594) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2147) with value change indicating version evolution.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with identical semantic content but different casing pattern.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field nodes renamed to workflowAgents maintaining same semantic purpose but different naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field agentName renamed to name, removing redundant prefix while preserving meaning.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field model renamed to modelDeploymentName providing more descriptive and specific naming.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents, indicating platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools array renamed to toolReferences with empty arrays, suggesting architectural change in tool management.",8,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task wrapper object completely removed in AAVA 2.0, with description moved to agent level and expectedOutput field eliminated entirely.",9,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 flattens the task structure by moving description directly to agent level, reducing nesting depth but removing the expectedOutput specification.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput field in AAVA 2.0 reduces metadata completeness and may impact downstream systems expecting output specifications.",11,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Addition of agentId field in AAVA 2.0 provides better entity identification and supports improved referential integrity.",6,7
deduction,risk,"Structural changes between versions may break existing systems that depend on the AAVA 1.0 schema format, requiring migration planning.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool reference architecture change from string arrays to empty toolReferences arrays suggests incomplete migration or architectural shift.",8,11
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with consistent structure and no broken references or logical inconsistencies.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with improved structure and consistent field naming, though some fields are empty.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain the same three-agent workflow pattern: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases agents.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain functionally identical between versions, preserving the detailed task specifications and requirements.",10,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are no longer used or if this represents incomplete data migration.",8,11
