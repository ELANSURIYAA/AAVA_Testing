deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and naming conventions. Major structural changes include nested workflow details, renamed agent arrays, and enhanced agent metadata structure.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved: both versions define a 3-agent workflow for DI DataSpecs Model updates with identical agent purposes and task descriptions.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent functional roles remain consistent: Technical Specification agent, Delta Model Changes agent, and Functional Test Cases agent maintain same responsibilities.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root-level structural reorganization: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with nested workFlowDetail object containing id/name (v2).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' indicating improved semantic clarity.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata structure enhanced: agentName->name, model->modelDeploymentName, tools->toolReferences with empty arrays.",5,8
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier: workflowId (1594) -> workFlowDetail.id (2147) - different values suggest version evolution.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name: workflowName -> workFlowDetail.name with slight formatting change ('DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' -> 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN').",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container: 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' for better semantic meaning.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming: 'agentName' field renamed to 'name' for consistency.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model reference: 'model' field renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' for specificity.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool handling: 'tools' array with string values replaced by 'toolReferences' with empty arrays.",8,11
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgrade: gpt-4 -> gpt-4.1 across all agents indicating platform evolution.",7,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references structure changed from string array to empty array, removing tool specifications.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Agent IDs introduced in v2 (agentId: 3885, 3474, 3545) adding unique identification not present in v1.",0,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool specifications removed in v2 - DI_Github_File_Writer_Z tool reference lost from first agent.",8,11
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata structure with nested objects improves data organization but increases complexity.",2,2
deduction,schema_evolution,"Agent identification system added with unique IDs enabling better tracking and reference management.",0,8
deduction,risk,"Tool reference removal may break downstream systems expecting tool specifications in metadata.",8,11
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID change (1594->2147) may impact systems using ID for workflow identification and tracking.",2,3
