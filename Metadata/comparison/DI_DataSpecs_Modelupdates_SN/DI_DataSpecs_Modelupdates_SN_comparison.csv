deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and modernized field naming conventions.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same conceptual workflow for DI DataSpecs Model updates with three core agents. The business purpose and agent functionalities remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces a hierarchical structure with workFlowDetail wrapper and workflowAgents array, representing a significant architectural shift from the flat nodes array in AAVA 1.0.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) with enhanced object structure including agentId field.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) across all agent objects.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_removal,"Field 'tools' array completely removed from AAVA 2.0 agent structure, replaced with empty 'toolReferences' array.",8,
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' added to each agent object in AAVA 2.0 with values 3885, 3474, and 3545 respectively.",, 7
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure remains identical in both versions but nested differently due to parent object changes.",11,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of explicit tool references in AAVA 2.0 may impact tool dependency tracking and governance.",8,
deduction,naming_convention,"AAVA 2.0 adopts more descriptive field names (modelDeploymentName vs model) improving self-documentation.",7,9
deduction,data_consistency,"Agent descriptions remain identical between versions ensuring functional consistency despite structural changes.",12,11
deduction,version_evolution,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution and potential capability enhancement.",7,9
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may require significant updates to dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 flat structure.",4,2
deduction,risk,"Removal of tools array could break systems relying on explicit tool dependency information.",8,
deduction,compatibility_concern,"ID value changes (1594 to 2147) suggest different workflow instances rather than version evolution of same workflow.",2,3
deduction,architectural_improvement,"Hierarchical structure in AAVA 2.0 provides better organization and scalability for complex workflows.",1,2
deduction,metadata_quality,"Both versions maintain high metadata quality with comprehensive task descriptions and clear expected outputs.",11,10
