deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 with preserved semantic meaning but substantial architectural changes. The workflow metadata maintains conceptual integrity while introducing hierarchical improvements and modernized field naming conventions.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical agent purposes and functionality descriptions.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain semantically identical across all three agents, preserving business logic and requirements.",12,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: flat workflow structure replaced with nested workFlowDetail object, improving metadata organization.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata including agentId fields.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (1594) renamed and relocated to workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with identical value 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (minor formatting difference).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents - semantic meaning preserved, structural naming improved.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name within agent objects - semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deductions,type_change,"model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' - indicates platform evolution.",7,9
deductions,structural_enhancement,"New agentId fields added (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identifiers for agents - enhances referential integrity.",6,7
deductions,constraint_change,"tools array replaced with empty toolReferences arrays - indicates architectural shift in tool management approach.",8,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool references removed in AAVA 2.0 may impact downstream systems expecting tool metadata.",8,10
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical relationships.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with improved hierarchical organization and consistent field types.",1,
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may require updates to parsing logic in downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Tool reference removal could break systems depending on tool metadata for workflow execution.",8,10
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a minor-to-moderate version change with backward compatibility concerns due to structural reorganization.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent task descriptions ensuring functional continuity despite structural changes.",12,8
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 suggests this represents a new workflow instance rather than in-place evolution.",2,3
