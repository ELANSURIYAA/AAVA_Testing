deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced agent modeling. AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical organization and enhanced metadata while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow with identical functional purposes and task descriptions.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical task description and output requirements across both versions.",8,6
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete task specification and expected outputs between versions.",46,31
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains identical functional requirements and output format specifications.",47,57
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical structure with workFlowDetail container vs flat structure in AAVA 1.0.",1,2
