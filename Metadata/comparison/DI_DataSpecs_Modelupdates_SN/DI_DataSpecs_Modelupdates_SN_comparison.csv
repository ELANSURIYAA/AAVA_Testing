deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates) but introduces enhanced metadata organization and agent management patterns. Key changes include restructured JSON schema, enhanced agent metadata, and improved tool reference management.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains identical: DI DataSpecs Modelupdates for data integration specifications. All three agents maintain equivalent functional descriptions and business objectives.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN preserves identical task description and output requirements across both versions, ensuring business continuity.",8,12
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN maintains same DMEA functionality and delta computation logic in both versions.",37,42
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains identical test case generation requirements and markdown output format.",67,72
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' (lines 2-3) to structured 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties (lines 2-5).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata structure significantly enhanced: AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId', 'modelDeploymentName', and 'toolReferences' replacing simple 'agentName', 'model', and 'tools' array.",8,7
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID field renamed: 'workflowId' (1594) becomes 'workFlowDetail.id' (2147) with different value indicating version progression.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name standardized: 'workflowName' becomes 'workFlowDetail.name' with space normalization ('DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN').",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent name normalization: underscores removed from agent names (e.g., 'DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN' to 'DI Data Technical Specification SN').",8,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'model' field (gpt-4) replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' (gpt-4.1) indicating version upgrade.",9,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed: AAVA 1.0 uses string array 'tools' while AAVA 2.0 uses empty 'toolReferences' array, potentially breaking tool dependency resolution.",10,95
deduction,missing_metadata,"Agent IDs introduced in AAVA 2.0 (agentId: 3885, 3474, 3545) without corresponding mapping from AAVA 1.0, creating potential traceability gaps.",8,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Task descriptions maintain identical content but lose structured metadata organization present in AAVA 1.0's 'task' object with separate 'description' and 'expectedOutput'.",11,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Cost estimation sections preserved in task descriptions but formatting consistency varies between versions.",35,40
deduction,schema_evolution,"JSON schema evolution from array-based to object-hierarchical structure improves metadata organization but requires migration tooling.",4,6
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference mechanism unclear in AAVA 2.0: empty 'toolReferences' arrays may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change.",95,95
deduction,risk,"Breaking change risk: downstream systems expecting 'nodes' array structure will fail with AAVA 2.0's 'workflowAgents' array.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Model version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1) may introduce behavioral differences requiring validation testing.",9,10
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID change (1594 to 2147) may break existing references and lineage tracking systems.",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax valid with proper array structure and consistent field naming conventions.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"All agent task descriptions properly formatted with valid markdown and structured sections.",11,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Tool references properly structured as string arrays with valid tool names.",10,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax valid with enhanced object hierarchy and proper nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Agent descriptions maintain content integrity despite structural changes.",11,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Empty toolReferences arrays syntactically valid but semantically incomplete compared to AAVA 1.0.",95,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical business logic and functional requirements within agent task descriptions.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major version upgrade with enhanced metadata management capabilities.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Migration from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 requires careful handling of structural dependencies and tool reference resolution.",1,1
