deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and some metadata degradation. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced agent identification and model deployment naming but removes critical task output specifications.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN renamed to DI Data Technical Specification SN (spaces added). Semantic meaning preserved.",8,7
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN renamed to DI Delta Model Changes SN (spaces added). Semantic meaning preserved.",33,19
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN renamed to DI Functional Test Cases SN (spaces added). Semantic meaning preserved.",58,31
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure significantly reorganized: workflowId/workflowName replaced with workFlowDetail object containing id/name.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' indicating architectural shift from node-based to agent-based model.",7,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification changed from 'agentName' to 'name' field across all agents.",8,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model specification evolved from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' suggesting deployment-aware model management.",9,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool references restructured from 'tools' array to 'toolReferences' array with empty arrays in v2.",10,43
deduction,field_change,"workflowId (1594) replaced with workFlowDetail.id (2147). Indicates workflow versioning.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscores to spaces).",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent model versions upgraded: 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents.",9,8
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification changed from string agentName to numeric agentId plus string name.",8,7
deduction,missing_metadata,"Critical task structure completely removed in AAVA 2.0: task.description and task.expectedOutput fields missing.",11,0
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tool specifications removed: AAVA 1.0 specified 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool, AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences.",10,43
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expected output specifications reduces metadata quality and governance compliance.",0,0
deduction,governance_issue,"Removal of task structure eliminates traceability between agent capabilities and expected deliverables.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and complete metadata.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but missing critical task metadata reduces completeness.",0,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents major structural change with backward compatibility concerns.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Missing task specifications may break downstream systems expecting complete agent definitions.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Empty tool references may indicate incomplete migration or tool deprecation.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 may impact workflow tracking and lineage systems.",2,3
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether toolReferences empty arrays represent intentional removal or incomplete specification.",0,43
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId numeric identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545) enabling better agent management.",0,7
deduction,general_finding,"Model deployment naming in v2 suggests infrastructure-aware model management capabilities.",0,8
deduction,general_finding,"Consistent agent descriptions preserved across versions maintaining functional specifications.",11,9
