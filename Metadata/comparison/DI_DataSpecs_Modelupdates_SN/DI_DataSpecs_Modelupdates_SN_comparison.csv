deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution of the workflow metadata with preserved semantic meaning but substantial schema reorganization. The core business logic and agent purposes remain intact while the metadata contract has been modernized with new naming conventions and hierarchical structures.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"All three agents maintain identical core functionality and business purpose. Agent names show minor formatting changes (underscores vs spaces) but preserve meaning completely.",5,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions are identical across versions indicating preserved business requirements and functional specifications.",15,20
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root-level workflow identification changed from flat properties (workflowId workflowName) to nested object structure (workFlowDetail.id workFlowDetail.name).",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' representing architectural evolution from generic nodes to specialized agent entities.",4,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Individual agent structure completely reorganized: agentName->name model->modelDeploymentName added agentId removed task structure removed tools array.",5,8
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (1594) mapped to workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic preservation with value update indicating new workflow version.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName mapped to workFlowDetail.name with identical semantic content but structural reorganization.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array - architectural terminology evolution.",4,7
deductions,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name - simplified naming convention.",6,9
deductions,type_change,"model field (gpt-4) evolved to modelDeploymentName (gpt-4.1) indicating both naming convention change and version upgrade.",7,11
deductions,constraint_change,"tools array structure replaced with toolReferences array but all agents show empty arrays in v2.0 - potential data loss or migration incomplete.",8,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"Complete task structure missing in AAVA 2.0 including description and expectedOutput fields - significant metadata degradation affecting governance.",9,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Agent task descriptions and expected outputs removed in v2.0 reducing documentation quality and traceability.",10,
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of detailed task specifications in v2.0 impacts metadata governance and reduces self-documentation capabilities.",9,
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool references are empty across all agents in v2.0 suggesting incomplete migration or architectural change not fully implemented.",8,12
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3885 3474 3545) adding unique identification not present in v1.0.",8,10
deductions,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical restructuring from flat workflow properties to nested workFlowDetail object improves data organization.",2,2
deductions,risk,"Missing task metadata in v2.0 may break downstream systems expecting detailed agent specifications and output formats.",9,
deductions,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest potential integration issues with tool management systems.",8,12
deductions,risk,"Model version change from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may impact cost calculations and performance expectations in dependent systems.",7,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid and internally consistent with proper array structures and complete metadata.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types and no orphaned references.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but shows incomplete migration with empty toolReferences arrays.",1,1
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Missing task structure creates incomplete agent definitions reducing metadata completeness.",8,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain three identical agents: Technical Specification Data Model Changes and Functional Test Cases.",4,7
deductions,general_finding,"Agent ordering and count preserved across versions ensuring workflow sequence integrity.",4,7
deductions,general_finding,"Core agent descriptions remain identical preserving functional requirements and business logic.",15,20
