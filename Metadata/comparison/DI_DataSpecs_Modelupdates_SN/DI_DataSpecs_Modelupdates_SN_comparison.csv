deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced metadata organization. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more sophisticated hierarchical structure while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define a DI DataSpecs workflow with three core agents for technical specification, delta model changes, and functional test cases. The business purpose and agent functionality remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces major structural reorganization: flat 'nodes' array replaced with hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' objects, representing significant architectural evolution.",3,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value format change from underscore to space-separated.",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) in AAVA 2.0 structure.",6,8
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' introduced in AAVA 2.0 (line 7) providing unique numeric identifiers for agents.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools array 'tools' (line 8) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 11) with empty arrays in AAVA 2.0.",8,11
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure maintained but nested deeper within agent objects in both versions.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references removed in AAVA 2.0 - all agents show empty toolReferences arrays, potentially impacting tool integration.",8,11
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents, indicating platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,naming_convention,"Workflow name format changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscores to spaces).",3,4
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with enhanced metadata structure, improved organization, and additional tracking fields.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact downstream systems expecting flat node arrays and specific field names from AAVA 1.0.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Removal of tool references in AAVA 2.0 may break existing tool integration workflows.",8,11
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no broken references.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and consistent internal references.",0,1
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and agent purposes, ensuring functional continuity despite structural changes.",10,10
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent at 3 agents across both versions with same core functionality.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output formats and requirements remain identical between versions, ensuring output compatibility.",50,50
