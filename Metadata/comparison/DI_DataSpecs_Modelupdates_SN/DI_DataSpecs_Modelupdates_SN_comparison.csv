deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been restructured with enhanced agent metadata and improved model deployment specifications. However, this introduces moderate compatibility concerns and requires careful migration planning.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' preserved across both versions with identical business purpose and agent functionality descriptions.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical task descriptions and business logic requirements.",6,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent naming convention evolved from underscore format (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN) to space-separated format (DI Data Technical Specification SN) but semantic meaning unchanged.",7,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' fields to nested 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent definition structure completely redesigned: AAVA 1.0 uses 'agentName', 'model', 'tools' while AAVA 2.0 uses 'agentId', 'name', 'modelDeploymentName', 'toolReferences'.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID changed from 'workflowId: 1594' to nested 'workFlowDetail.id: 2147' indicating version increment.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name changed from 'workflowName' to 'workFlowDetail.name' with slight formatting difference ('DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN').",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' array to 'workflowAgents' array, improving semantic clarity.",5,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from 'agentName' string to combination of 'agentId' (numeric) and 'name' (string).",7,9
deductions,type_change,"Model specification evolved from simple 'model: gpt-4' string to 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools specification changed from populated 'tools' array with 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' to empty 'toolReferences' array, potentially indicating architectural change in tool management.",9,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' numeric identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545) not present in AAVA 1.0, enhancing agent tracking capabilities.",0,9
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 1.0 contains explicit tool references ('DI_Github_File_Writer_Z') while AAVA 2.0 has empty 'toolReferences' arrays, indicating potential tool configuration externalization.",9,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Field naming inconsistency: 'workFlowDetail' uses camelCase while 'workflowAgents' uses lowercase, violating consistent naming conventions.",2,7
deductions,governance_issue,"Agent descriptions in both versions are identical but extremely verbose (1000+ characters), suggesting need for summary fields in future versions.",15,13
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor version evolution with backward-incompatible structural changes requiring migration scripts.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of numeric agent IDs suggests preparation for database persistence and improved referential integrity.",0,9
deductions,risk,"Structural changes between versions will break existing parsers and require comprehensive migration planning for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change that could impact agent execution capabilities.",9,12
deductions,risk,"Model version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' may introduce behavioral differences requiring validation testing.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field naming and proper array structures.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"All agent task descriptions are properly escaped and formatted within JSON structure.",15,0
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"Workflow ID and agent count are consistent (3 agents defined in nodes array).",2,0
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper nested object structure and array formatting.",0,1
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"Agent IDs are properly defined as integers and names as strings with consistent typing.",0,9
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"Minor inconsistency in field naming convention between 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' reduces internal consistency score.",0,2
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical and comprehensive task descriptions for all three agents, ensuring functional continuity.",15,13
deductions,general_finding,"Expected output formats and cost estimation sections are preserved exactly across both versions.",50,50
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 appears to be preparation for enhanced workflow management system with improved metadata tracking and agent identification.",1,1
