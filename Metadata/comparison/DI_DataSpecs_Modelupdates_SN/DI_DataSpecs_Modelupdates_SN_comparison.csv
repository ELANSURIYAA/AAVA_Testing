deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major changes include workflow structure reorganization, agent metadata enhancement, and naming convention updates. The evolution introduces improved metadata richness but creates moderate compatibility concerns.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality remain semantically equivalent between versions. All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical business objectives and processing logic.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization: workflow metadata moved from flat properties to nested workFlowDetail object, agents restructured from nodes array to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata schema.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root property workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root property workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value change from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array property nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6) with enhanced object schema",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8) across all agent objects",6,8
deduction,field_addition,"New agentId property (line 7) added to all agents in AAVA 2.0 with values 3885, 3474, 3545",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent property model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9) with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent property tools (line 8) renamed to toolReferences (line 10) and changed from string array to empty array",8,10
deduction,structural_change,"Agent task property (line 9) restructured: description moved to root level, expectedOutput content relocated",9,11
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 metadata demonstrates excellent JSON syntax validity and internal consistency. All references are properly structured with no orphaned objects or type inconsistencies.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 metadata shows good JSON syntax validity with minor inconsistency: toolReferences arrays are empty despite tools being referenced in agent descriptions.",0,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference inconsistency in AAVA 2.0: agents reference DI_Github_File_Writer_Z in descriptions but toolReferences arrays are empty, creating metadata governance gap",0,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution from flat to nested structure improves metadata organization but requires migration logic for dependent systems",1,1
deduction,type_change,"Model deployment specification enhanced from simple string (gpt-4) to versioned deployment name (gpt-4.1) indicating infrastructure evolution",7,9
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent identification enhanced with explicit agentId properties providing unique identifiers for system integration",0,7
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 1.0 lacks explicit agent identifiers that could impact system integration and agent lifecycle management",6,0
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers and integration systems expecting AAVA 1.0 flat schema format",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool reference inconsistency in AAVA 2.0 may cause runtime failures if systems expect populated toolReferences arrays",0,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow name formatting inconsistency (underscore vs space separation) may cause confusion in system identification",3,4
deduction,general_finding,"Agent task descriptions remain identical preserving functional specifications and business logic requirements",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output formats and quality criteria preserved ensuring downstream compatibility for generated artifacts",45,0
deduction,general_finding,"Cost estimation sections maintained in both versions supporting operational transparency and resource planning",85,0
