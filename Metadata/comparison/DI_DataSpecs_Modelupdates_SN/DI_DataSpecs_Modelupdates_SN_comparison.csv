deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution of the AAVA 1.0 workflow definition while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates) with identical agent functionality but introduces substantial architectural changes including field renaming, hierarchical restructuring, and enhanced metadata organization. Key concerns include backward compatibility risks due to extensive field name changes and the removal of tool references in agent definitions.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core business semantics are well-preserved. The workflow name 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' maintains identical meaning with minor formatting changes (underscores vs spaces). All three agents retain their essential purposes: technical specification creation, delta model changes, and functional test case generation.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain functionally identical across versions, preserving business logic and operational requirements. The core data integration workflow semantics are maintained despite structural changes.",4,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy, representing a more sophisticated metadata architecture.",3,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification moved from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' fields to nested 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties, increasing structural complexity.",2,2
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147, indicating this represents a different workflow instance or version evolution.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root-level field 'workflowId' renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' with hierarchical nesting introduced.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root-level field 'workflowName' renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' with value formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with structural implications for parsing logic.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' within agent objects.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'model' renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' replaced with 'toolReferences' but populated as empty arrays, potentially indicating architectural change in tool management.",8,38
deductions,field_change,"New field 'agentId' added to each agent in AAVA 2.0 (values: 3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identification.",0,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent task structure flattened - 'task.description' moved to root-level 'description' within agent objects.",9,10
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint changed from populated string arrays to empty arrays, potentially breaking tool dependency resolution.",8,38
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes explicit tool definitions that were present in AAVA 1.0, specifically 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool reference for first agent.",8,38
deductions,missing_metadata,"Task-level 'expectedOutput' field completely removed in AAVA 2.0, losing important output specification metadata.",10,0
deductions,governance_issue,"Removal of expectedOutput specifications reduces metadata governance quality and may impact downstream validation processes.",10,0
deductions,governance_issue,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural change that may affect workflow execution.",8,38
deductions,type_change,"Model specification evolved from simple string 'gpt-4' to versioned 'gpt-4.1' indicating model upgrade.",7,9
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences arrays represent intentional architectural change or incomplete data migration.",8,38
deductions,risk,"Extensive field renaming without alias mapping may break existing integrations, analytics pipelines, and governance tooling dependent on AAVA 1.0 field names.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Removal of tool references and expected output specifications may impact workflow execution and validation capabilities.",8,10
deductions,risk,"Changed workflow ID (1594 to 2147) may indicate this is a different workflow rather than an evolution, requiring careful validation of business continuity.",2,3
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor-to-moderate schema evolution with backward compatibility concerns due to field renaming and structural reorganization.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of agent IDs and hierarchical workflow details suggests evolution toward more sophisticated workflow management capabilities.",0,2
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All field references are properly defined and no orphaned objects detected.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. Agent IDs are unique and properly referenced within the new hierarchy.",0,1
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions and core functionality specifications, ensuring business logic preservation despite structural changes.",9,10
deductions,general_finding,"The evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a metadata architecture modernization with enhanced organization but introduces migration complexity.",1,1
