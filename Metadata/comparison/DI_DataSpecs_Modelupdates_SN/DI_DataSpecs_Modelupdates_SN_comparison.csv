deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and modern naming conventions. Major structural changes include workflow ID evolution (1594->2147), hierarchical reorganization, and agent metadata enrichment.",1,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same three-agent pipeline for technical specifications, delta model changes, and functional test cases. Business logic and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Significant structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array. This represents architectural modernization but breaks backward compatibility.",3,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Value changed from 1594 to 2147 indicating version evolution.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore to space).",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Represents same conceptual entity but with different naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' across all agents. Semantic meaning preserved but field naming simplified.",7,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 8) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9). Values evolved from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version upgrade.",8,9
deduction,structural_change,"Field 'tools' array (line 9) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 10). AAVA 1.0 contains actual tool names while AAVA 2.0 shows empty arrays, indicating architectural shift to reference-based tool management.",9,10
deduction,missing_field,"Field 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' (lines 10-50) removed in AAVA 2.0. Task details now stored only in 'description' field, representing significant metadata consolidation.",10,10
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' added to each agent in AAVA 2.0 (lines 7, 35, 63). Provides unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,7
deduction,content_preservation,"Agent descriptions remain semantically identical between versions despite structural changes. Technical specification agent, delta model changes agent, and functional test cases agent maintain same core functionality.",11,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Task 'expectedOutput' metadata removed in AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata richness and potentially impacting governance and validation frameworks.",25,0
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All objects properly nested, arrays well-formed, and no orphaned references detected.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but shows some inconsistencies: empty 'toolReferences' arrays suggest incomplete migration from tools-based to reference-based architecture.",0,10
deduction,risk,"Structural changes between versions may break existing analytics pipelines, governance tools, and validation frameworks that depend on AAVA 1.0 schema.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Removal of 'expectedOutput' metadata reduces traceability and may impact quality assurance processes that rely on detailed task specifications.",0,0
deduction,compatibility_issue,"Field path changes (workflowId -> workFlowDetail.id) require code updates in downstream systems. No backward compatibility aliases detected.",2,3
deduction,naming_convention,"Inconsistent naming evolution: 'workflowName' becomes 'workFlowDetail.name' but 'agentName' becomes just 'name'. Suggests incomplete standardization.",3,8
deduction,version_evolution,"Workflow ID increment (1594->2147) and model version upgrade (gpt-4->gpt-4.1) indicate legitimate version progression rather than data corruption.",2,3
deduction,architectural_shift,"Migration from embedded tools array to toolReferences suggests move toward microservices or plugin architecture, but implementation appears incomplete.",9,10
