deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and moderate semantic preservation. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced schema organization while maintaining core business logic.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same business purpose across versions.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent functionality semantically equivalent: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) preserve their core responsibilities.",6,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Model deployment evolution: gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 represents version upgrade maintaining semantic compatibility.",9,11
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root structure reorganized: workflowId/workflowName flattened to workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array changed to 'workflowAgents' array, improving semantic clarity.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent property restructuring: agentName->name, model->modelDeploymentName, tools->toolReferences with structural changes.",8,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tool reference mechanism changed: String array tools replaced with empty toolReferences arrays, indicating architectural shift.",12,15
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier: workflowId (1594) mapped to workFlowDetail.id (2147) - different values indicate separate instances.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow naming: workflowName mapped to workFlowDetail.name with consistent value preservation.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming convention: agentName with underscores changed to name with spaces for readability.",9,10
deductions,field_change,"Model specification: model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade (gpt-4 -> gpt-4.1).",10,11
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID type preserved: Integer type maintained across versions (1594 -> 2147).",2,3
deductions,type_change,"Agent ID introduction: New agentId field added in v2.0 providing unique agent identification.",8,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool constraint modification: Required tools array in v1.0 replaced with optional empty toolReferences in v2.0.",12,15

deductions,missing_metadata,"Task structure flattened: Complex task object with description/expectedOutput in v1.0 simplified to description-only in v2.0.",14,12

deductions,correctness_aava_2,"Minor inconsistency: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete tool integration specification.",15,
deductions,risk,"Integration breaking changes: Structural modifications require updates to all dependent systems and APIs.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Tool reference gaps: Missing tool specifications in v2.0 may cause runtime failures in agent execution.",13,15
deductions,risk,"Metadata governance degradation: Reduced specification detail may impact system documentation and maintenance.",14,12
