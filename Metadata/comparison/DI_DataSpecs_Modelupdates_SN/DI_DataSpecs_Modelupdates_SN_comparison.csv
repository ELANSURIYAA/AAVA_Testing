deduction,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The metadata demonstrates improved organization through nested structures and enhanced model versioning. However structural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks for downstream systems.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents maintain identical core functionality and business purpose across versions. Agent descriptions are preserved verbatim indicating strong semantic alignment.",4,7
deduction,semantic_analysis,"DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN agent maintains identical task description and output requirements in both versions.",5,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN agent preserves complete functional specification across both metadata versions.",32,19
deduction,semantic_analysis,"DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN agent retains identical test case generation requirements and markdown output format.",59,31
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized from flat workflowId/workflowName/nodes to nested workFlowDetail/workflowAgents pattern.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' representing conceptual shift from generic nodes to specific agent entities.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Individual agent structure enhanced with agentId field and renamed agentName to name for consistency.",5,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model reference evolved from simple 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' indicating deployment-aware architecture.",6,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools architecture changed from string array 'tools' to object array 'toolReferences' suggesting enhanced tool management.",7,43
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from numeric workflowId (1594) to structured workFlowDetail.id (2147) with enhanced metadata.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name evolved from simple workflowName string to workFlowDetail.name with improved naming convention.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced with addition of agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) for unique agent tracking.",5,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming standardized from agentName to name field maintaining consistency with workflow naming patterns.",5,9
deduction,type_change,"Model specification upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version advancement and deployment tracking.",6,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools constraint relaxed from required string array to optional empty toolReferences array in all agents.",7,43
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 1.0 tools array contains 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' reference while AAVA 2.0 toolReferences are empty arrays.",7,43
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure field missing in AAVA 2.0 agents replaced by direct description field integration.",8,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"ExpectedOutput specifications not explicitly structured in AAVA 2.0 agent definitions.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references completely removed in AAVA 2.0 potentially breaking tool-dependent workflows and integrations.",7,43
deduction,governance_issue,"Task structure flattening may impact downstream systems expecting nested task/expectedOutput hierarchy.",8,11
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agent-centric model with enhanced metadata tracking and deployment awareness.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Structural evolution suggests migration from simple workflow definition to enterprise-grade agent orchestration platform.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Renamed root fields (workflowId to workFlowDetail.id) may break existing API integrations and data pipelines.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool reference removal creates potential runtime failures for agents expecting tool availability.",7,43
deduction,risk,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral changes affecting output consistency.",6,10
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization requires comprehensive testing of dependent systems and migration planning.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax with consistent field types and logical structure.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"All agent definitions contain required fields with proper nesting and valid references.",4,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Task descriptions maintain consistent formatting and complete specification requirements.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON structure with enhanced organizational hierarchy.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Agent definitions properly structured with consistent field naming and type usage.",7,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Missing task structure reduces metadata completeness compared to AAVA 1.0 specification depth.",11,
