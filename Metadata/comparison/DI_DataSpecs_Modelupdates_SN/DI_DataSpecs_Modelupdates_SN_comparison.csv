deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and versioning while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include nested object hierarchy and enhanced agent metadata.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent identical DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with same three agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. Core business logic and agent purposes remain unchanged.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization: flat 'nodes' array replaced with nested 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array. This represents architectural evolution toward more structured metadata management.",4,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value format changed from snake_case to title case.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Represents same agent collection with enhanced naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' across all agents. Simplified naming convention.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array. AAVA 1.0 contains actual tool names while AAVA 2.0 shows empty arrays.",8,75
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent task structure flattened in AAVA 2.0. Task object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' fields replaced with single 'description' field containing merged content.",9,10
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (1594) to integer (2147). Represents different workflow instance or version increment.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field for each agent, adding unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",6,7
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes 'expectedOutput' as separate field, merging content into 'description'. This reduces metadata granularity for output specifications.",45,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tool references are empty in AAVA 2.0 while AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool. Potential metadata loss or architectural change.",8,75
deduction,governance_issue,"Field naming inconsistency: 'workFlowDetail' uses camelCase while 'workflowAgents' uses lowercase. AAVA 1.0 maintained consistent snake_case.",2,6
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents major schema evolution (v1 to v2) with breaking changes in object hierarchy and field organization. Migration scripts would be required.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting flat 'nodes' array. Downstream systems require updates to handle nested 'workFlowDetail' structure.",4,2
deduction,risk,"Empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change in tool management. Could impact agent execution capabilities.",8,75
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All required fields present and properly formatted.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but contains potential inconsistencies: empty toolReferences arrays and mixed camelCase/lowercase naming.",1,
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty 'toolReferences' in AAVA 2.0 represents intentional architectural change or incomplete data migration.",8,75
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions and core functionality specifications, ensuring business logic preservation despite structural changes.",9,10
