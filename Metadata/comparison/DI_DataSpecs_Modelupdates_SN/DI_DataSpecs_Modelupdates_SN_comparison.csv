deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization with nested objects and improved agent metadata but removes some tools configuration. The semantic meaning is largely preserved despite structural changes.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical three agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. Core business functionality remains consistent.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 restructures the JSON with workFlowDetail object containing id and name fields, replacing flat workflowId and workflowName. Agent structure enhanced with agentId, modelDeploymentName, and toolReferences array.",3,3
deductions,field_change,"Field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147. Semantic meaning preserved but identifier updated.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field workflowName (line 3) moved to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore removed).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Field nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Array structure preserved but element organization enhanced.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8) within agent objects. Semantic meaning identical.",6,8
deductions,field_addition,"New field agentId added in AAVA 2.0 (line 7) providing unique identifier for each agent. Enhances traceability and referencing.",0,7
deductions,field_change,"Field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version upgrade.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"Field tools (line 8) replaced with toolReferences (line 11) but array is empty in AAVA 2.0, removing tool configuration that existed in AAVA 1.0.",8,11
deductions,field_addition,"New field description added in AAVA 2.0 (line 10) containing the full task description that was previously nested under task.description in AAVA 1.0.",0,10
deductions,structural_change,"Task object structure flattened in AAVA 2.0. The nested task.description and task.expectedOutput from AAVA 1.0 are restructured with description moved to agent level and expectedOutput removed.",9,10
deductions,missing_field,"Field expectedOutput present in AAVA 1.0 task objects (lines 47, 86, 125) is completely removed in AAVA 2.0, potentially impacting output validation and quality control.",47,0
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput field reduces metadata completeness and may impact automated validation processes that depend on expected output specifications.",0,0
deductions,type_consistency,"All agent descriptions maintain identical content between versions, ensuring functional consistency despite structural reorganization.",0,0
deductions,constraint_validation,"AAVA 1.0 tools array contains string values ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] while AAVA 2.0 toolReferences arrays are empty, indicating potential loss of tool configuration.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",0,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but shows some inconsistencies: empty toolReferences arrays and missing expectedOutput fields reduce completeness.",0,0
deductions,schema_evolution,"The evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a moderate schema upgrade with improved organization but some metadata loss. Changes appear intentional for enhanced structure.",0,0
deductions,risk_assessment,"Medium risk: Tool configuration loss and missing expectedOutput fields may impact downstream systems expecting these metadata elements. Agent ID additions improve traceability.",0,0
deductions,compatibility_impact,"Breaking changes include field renames (workflowId to workFlowDetail.id, nodes to workflowAgents) and structural reorganization that will require dependent system updates.",0,0
