deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include nested object structures and enhanced agent modeling with new identifiers and deployment specifications. Semantic alignment remains strong but structural reorganization introduces moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical functional purpose and agent responsibilities.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical task description and output format requirements across both versions.",8,12
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete functional specification including DMEA stages and expected outputs.",47,35
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains identical test case generation requirements and markdown formatting specifications.",89,67
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: flat 'nodes' array (v1) replaced with nested 'workflowAgents' under 'workFlowDetail' object (v2).",4,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification moved from top-level fields to nested object structure: workflowId/workflowName → workFlowDetail.id/name.",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent modeling enhanced: simple agentName/model/tools structure (v1) expanded to agentId/name/modelDeploymentName/toolReferences (v2).",8,12
deductions,field_change,"workflowId: 1594 (v1) → workFlowDetail.id: 2147 (v2) - ID value changed indicating different workflow instance.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' (v1) → workFlowDetail.name: 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (v2) - underscore formatting removed.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes (v1) → workflowAgents (v2) - array renamed and restructured with enhanced agent properties.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"agentName (v1) → name (v2) - field renamed within agent objects.",8,13
deductions,field_change,"model: 'gpt-4' (v1) → modelDeploymentName: 'gpt-4.1' (v2) - model specification enhanced with version and deployment context.",9,14
deductions,field_change,"tools array (v1) → toolReferences array (v2) - tools structure changed from string array to empty array suggesting different referencing mechanism.",10,15
deductions,type_change,"Agent identification changed from string-based agentName to numeric agentId with separate name field.",8,12
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references structure modified: v1 uses populated string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'], v2 uses empty toolReferences arrays.",10,15
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId fields (3885, 3474, 3545) not present in v1, suggesting enhanced agent tracking.",12,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Model versioning inconsistency: v1 uses 'gpt-4', v2 uses 'gpt-4.1' - unclear if intentional upgrade or metadata drift.",9,14
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool reference mechanism unclear in v2: all agents show empty toolReferences despite v1 showing explicit tool dependencies.",10,15
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and proper nesting.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All agent task descriptions are complete and well-formed with proper markdown formatting in expectedOutput sections.",12,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Tool references properly specified as string array with valid tool name 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'.",10,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced nested object organization.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Agent descriptions maintain completeness but toolReferences arrays are empty, potentially indicating incomplete migration.",15,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Model deployment names properly formatted but version consistency needs validation (gpt-4.1 vs gpt-4).",14,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents moderate breaking change: client systems expecting v1 flat structure will require updates for v2 nested format.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Agent referencing mechanism changed significantly: agentName-based (v1) to agentId-based (v2) requiring mapping logic for existing integrations.",8,12
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: downstream systems using workflowId/workflowName direct access will break with v2 nested structure.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: empty toolReferences in v2 may indicate incomplete metadata migration or changed tool binding mechanism.",10,15
deductions,risk,"Data lineage risk: changed workflow ID (1594→2147) may break existing tracking and audit systems.",2,3
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear whether workflow ID change represents same workflow evolution or entirely different workflow instance.",2,3
deductions,ambiguity,"Tool reference mechanism change not documented: unclear if empty arrays are intentional or migration artifacts.",10,15
deductions,general_finding,"Overall assessment: AAVA 2.0 represents thoughtful architectural evolution with enhanced metadata structure but introduces moderate migration complexity.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Recommendation: Implement backward compatibility layer and clear migration documentation for v1 to v2 transition.",1,1
