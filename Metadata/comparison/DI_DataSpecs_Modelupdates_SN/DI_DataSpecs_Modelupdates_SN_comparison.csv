deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution of the AAVA 1.0 workflow definition while preserving core semantic meaning. The changes reflect a modernization effort with improved data modeling practices but introduce breaking changes that impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same conceptual workflow 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' with identical three-agent pipeline: Technical Specification -> Delta Model Changes -> Functional Test Cases. Core business logic and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions are identical between versions, preserving functional requirements and expected outputs. The workflow purpose and agent interactions maintain semantic consistency.",15,13
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization from flat workflow object to nested workFlowDetail container. This represents a shift toward more hierarchical metadata organization.",2,2
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (integer) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' with hierarchical nesting. Semantic meaning preserved but access pattern changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (string) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' with hierarchical nesting. Semantic meaning preserved but access pattern changed.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Root array 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' reflecting more precise domain terminology. Improves semantic clarity.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' with addition of new 'agentId' field providing unique identification.",15,8
deductions,field_change,"Field 'model' renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' providing more specific semantic meaning about deployment context.",16,10
deductions,type_change,"Model specification changed from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade. May impact processing capabilities and costs.",16,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure completely flattened from nested 'task.description' and 'task.expectedOutput' to single 'description' field. This represents significant structural simplification but potential information loss.",17,11
deductions,field_change,"Tools array structure changed from string array to 'toolReferences' empty array. Tool specification method completely altered.",17,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed in AAVA 2.0. The 'task.expectedOutput' field containing detailed formatting requirements and cost estimation instructions is completely absent.",18,
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of detailed output format specifications reduces metadata governance quality and may impact downstream system expectations.",18,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical structure. No broken references or inconsistencies detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical structure. No broken references or inconsistencies detected.",1,
deductions,schema_evolution,"The evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a major version change with breaking structural modifications requiring migration scripts for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Flattened task structure and removed expectedOutput specifications may break downstream systems expecting detailed output format definitions.",17,11
deductions,risk,"Changed tool reference mechanism from string array to empty toolReferences array may impact agent execution capabilities.",17,12
deductions,risk,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral changes in agent outputs requiring validation testing.",16,10
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about actual tool availability and usage patterns compared to explicit tool names in AAVA 1.0.",17,12
deductions,general_finding,"Despite structural changes, the core workflow definition remains functionally equivalent with preserved agent sequence and business logic.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates improved naming conventions and hierarchical organization but at the cost of some metadata richness and backward compatibility.",1,1
