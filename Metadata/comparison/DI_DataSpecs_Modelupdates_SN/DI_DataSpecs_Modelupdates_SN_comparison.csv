deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced object modeling and improved agent organization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve metadata governance.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications model updates and functional testing. Business purpose and agent responsibilities remain semantically aligned.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical restructuring with workFlowDetail wrapper and workflowAgents array replacing flat nodes structure. This represents a significant architectural evolution from simple to complex object modeling.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Root field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved with improved hierarchical organization.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array field nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved but improved naming convention for clarity.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent object structure significantly enhanced in v2.0. Introduction of agentId field provides unique identification missing in v1.0.",6,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8). Simplified naming convention while preserving semantic meaning.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Agent field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9). Enhanced specificity and clarity in model reference.",7,9
deductions,type_change,"Model field value changed from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade. Backward compatibility impact for model-dependent systems.",7,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools array structure completely redesigned. V1.0 uses simple string array tools while v2.0 uses empty toolReferences array suggesting different tool management approach.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Task object structure preserved but nested differently. V1.0 has direct task object while v2.0 maintains same nesting level with description field.",9,10
deductions,field_change,"Task.expectedOutput field removed in v2.0 for agents 2 and 3. This represents metadata loss and potential governance degradation.",45,
deductions,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes expectedOutput specifications for Delta Model Changes and Functional Test Cases agents reducing metadata completeness.",45,
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates excellent JSON syntax validity with consistent structure proper nesting and no broken references. All agent definitions complete with task descriptions and expected outputs.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON syntax with enhanced object modeling. Minor inconsistency in toolReferences implementation (empty arrays vs null) but structurally sound.",1,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution from flat to hierarchical structure represents major version change. Improved agent identification and model specification but reduced metadata completeness in some areas.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting flat node structure. Tool management approach change requires validation of downstream integrations.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Model version changes from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may impact cost calculations and API compatibility in dependent systems.",7,9
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in v2.0 create ambiguity about tool availability compared to explicit tool names in v1.0.",8,11
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve core workflow logic. Task descriptions remain largely unchanged ensuring functional continuity.",4,6
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces better separation of concerns with workFlowDetail wrapper and enhanced agent metadata structure.",2,2
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata in 2 of 3 agents reduces documentation quality and may impact automated validation processes.",45,
