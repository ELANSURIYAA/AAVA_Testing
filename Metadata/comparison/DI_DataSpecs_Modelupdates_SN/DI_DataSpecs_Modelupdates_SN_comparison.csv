deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced object hierarchy and normalized agent representation while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve metadata governance.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and test cases.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same business objectives.",6,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0 nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' objects.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates ID (2147) and name into dedicated workFlowDetail object vs AAVA 1.0 inline workflowId (1594) and workflowName.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Agent representation normalized: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) absent in AAVA 1.0.",6,7
deduction,field_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'model' field in AAVA 1.0 becomes 'modelDeploymentName' in AAVA 2.0 with version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",8,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools reference restructured: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array becomes 'toolReferences' array in AAVA 2.0.",9,130
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened: AAVA 1.0 nested 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' becomes direct 'description' field in AAVA 2.0.",11,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Expected output specifications removed: AAVA 2.0 eliminates detailed expectedOutput constraints present in AAVA 1.0, reducing metadata completeness.",11,
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID data type changed: AAVA 1.0 uses integer workflowId (1594) vs AAVA 2.0 uses integer id (2147) within workFlowDetail object.",2,3
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degraded: AAVA 2.0 removes expectedOutput specifications, cost estimation requirements, and detailed formatting constraints.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool integration simplified: AAVA 1.0 explicit tool names (DI_Github_File_Writer_Z) replaced with empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0.",9,130
deduction,schema_evolution,"Major version evolution detected: Structural reorganization suggests breaking changes requiring migration strategy for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility broken: Flat nodes array to nested object structure requires code changes in consuming applications.",6,7
deduction,risk,"Metadata governance regression: Loss of expectedOutput specifications may impact quality assurance and validation processes.",11,
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference semantics unclear: Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about agent capabilities vs AAVA 1.0 explicit tool declarations.",9,130
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid: Well-formed structure with proper nesting and data types.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: All references and relationships are logically consistent.",1,

deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Internal consistency maintained: Agent IDs and references are properly structured.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Naming convention evolution: workflowName becomes name, agentName becomes name with agentId addition.",2,8
deduction,general_finding,"Model versioning improved: Explicit version tracking in modelDeploymentName (gpt-4.1) vs generic model field.",8,9
