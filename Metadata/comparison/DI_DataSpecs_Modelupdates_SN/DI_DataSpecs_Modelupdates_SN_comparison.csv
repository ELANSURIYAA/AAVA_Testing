deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate metadata degradation. AAVA 2.0 introduces breaking changes in JSON schema while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow identity maintained: workflowId 1594 maps to workFlowDetail.id 2147, workflowName maps to workFlowDetail.name with consistent naming.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical across versions with same core responsibilities.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: root-level 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' breaking backward compatibility.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow metadata restructured from flat properties to nested 'workFlowDetail' object increasing hierarchy depth.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent schema significantly modified: 'agentName' renamed to 'name', 'model' replaced with 'modelDeploymentName'.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure completely removed: 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' eliminated in v2.0.",11,10
deduction,field_change,"Root property 'workflowId' (integer) restructured to 'workFlowDetail.id' (integer) - semantic meaning preserved.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root property 'workflowName' (string) restructured to 'workFlowDetail.name' (string) - semantic meaning preserved.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array property 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' - breaking change affecting API consumers.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'agentName' renamed to 'name' - minor naming convention change.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'model' replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' - enhanced specificity but breaking change.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array - semantic alignment maintained.",8,12
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147 - indicates different workflow instance or versioning.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent ID constraint added: new 'agentId' field (3885, 3474, 3545) introduces unique identification.",6,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure elimination: 'task.description' and 'task.expectedOutput' completely removed reducing metadata richness.",11,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Agent descriptions moved from nested task structure to root level but content preserved.",12,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata quality degradation: loss of structured task definitions reduces governance traceability.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Breaking schema changes without backward compatibility aliases may impact dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid and well-formed with consistent structure throughout.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: all agent references and tool mappings are valid.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"No orphaned objects or broken references detected in workflow definition.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid and well-formed with proper nested object structure.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Minor inconsistency: empty 'toolReferences' arrays suggest incomplete migration from 'tools' structure.",12,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Agent ID sequence (3885, 3474, 3545) appears consistent but lacks validation context.",8,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution represents major version change with breaking modifications to core structure.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Workflow metadata normalization improves organization but breaks existing integrations.",2,2
deduction,schema_evolution,"Agent model enhanced with unique IDs and deployment-specific naming conventions.",6,8
deduction,risk,"High risk: breaking changes to 'nodes' array structure will impact all consuming applications.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Medium risk: task structure removal may break systems expecting detailed agent specifications.",11,
deduction,risk,"Low risk: field renames with preserved semantics require mapping updates but maintain functionality.",6,8
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow ID change (1594 to 2147) unclear whether represents same workflow evolution or different instance.",2,3
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool migration from 'tools' to 'toolReferences' incomplete - empty arrays suggest partial implementation.",8,12
deduction,general_finding,"Overall assessment: significant structural modernization with acceptable semantic preservation but concerning metadata loss.",1,1
