deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced entity modeling but removes critical task specification metadata, creating governance and completeness concerns.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases). Business meaning remains consistent.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN with same core functionality.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow naming evolution: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' becomes 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' - cosmetic change preserving meaning.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: 'nodes' array (v1.0 line 4) replaced with 'workflowAgents' array (v2.0 line 6). Different containment model.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification restructured: flat 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' (v1.0 lines 2-3) replaced with nested 'workFlowDetail' object (v2.0 lines 2-5).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent modeling enhanced: v2.0 introduces 'agentId' field (line 8) and 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10) for better entity management.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'agentName' (v1.0 line 7) becomes 'name' (v2.0 line 9). Semantic meaning preserved.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Model specification evolved: 'model' field (v1.0 line 8) becomes 'modelDeploymentName' (v2.0 line 10) with version upgrade 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Tools reference restructured: 'tools' array with string values (v1.0 line 9-11) becomes 'toolReferences' empty array (v2.0 line 12). Potential data loss.",9,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Critical task specification removed: v1.0 'task' object (lines 12-15) containing 'description' and 'expectedOutput' completely absent in v2.0. Major governance degradation.",12,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications lost: detailed formatting requirements, metadata templates, and cost estimation sections removed from v2.0.",15,
deduction,constraint_change,"Workflow ID type consistency: both versions use integer IDs (1594 vs 2147) maintaining data type compatibility.",2,3
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification enhanced: v2.0 introduces integer 'agentId' (3885, 3474, 3545) alongside string names for better referential integrity.",8,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degraded: v2.0 removes task specifications, expected outputs, and detailed formatting requirements reducing documentation quality.",12,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference information lost: v1.0 specifies 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool (line 11) while v2.0 has empty 'toolReferences' arrays.",11,12
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema version represents moderate evolution with enhanced entity modeling but reduced specification depth. Mixed improvement pattern.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: removal of 'task' object structure may break downstream systems expecting detailed task specifications.",12,
deduction,risk,"Data governance risk: loss of expected output formats and quality criteria reduces validation capabilities for dependent systems.",15,
deduction,risk,"Tool integration risk: empty 'toolReferences' arrays may indicate incomplete migration or loss of tool binding information.",11,12
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid: proper structure, balanced braces, correct array and object nesting throughout document.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: all agent references, field types, and nested structures logically coherent.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Minor formatting inconsistency: mixed spacing in metadata delimiter sections (lines 19-23) but does not affect JSON validity.",19,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid: proper structure, balanced braces, correct array and object nesting throughout document.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Structural consistency: 'workFlowDetail' object properly formed with required 'id' and 'name' fields.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Agent array consistency: all three agents follow identical schema pattern with required fields present.",7,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Empty array concern: 'toolReferences' consistently empty across all agents may indicate incomplete data migration.",12,
deduction,general_finding,"Model versioning: GPT model upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform evolution and potential capability enhancement.",8,10
deduction,general_finding,"Naming convention evolution: v2.0 adopts more formal entity naming with consistent capitalization and spacing patterns.",3,4
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference ambiguity: unclear whether empty 'toolReferences' arrays represent intentional removal or incomplete migration.",11,12
