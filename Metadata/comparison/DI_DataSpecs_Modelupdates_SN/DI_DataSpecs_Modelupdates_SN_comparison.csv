deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The metadata shows a transition from a flat workflow structure to a more sophisticated hierarchical model with enhanced agent definitions and improved model deployment specifications. While business functionality remains aligned, the architectural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN) preserved with identical business objectives across all three agents: technical specification generation, delta model changes, and functional test case creation.",2,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN with identical core functionality.",7,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions for all agents maintain semantic consistency with minor textual variations that do not alter business meaning.",15,15
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' to structured 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent definition structure completely redesigned: AAVA 1.0 'nodes' with 'agentName' became AAVA 2.0 'workflowAgents' with 'agentId' and 'name'.",6,7
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Camel case 'workFlowDetail' introduces inconsistency with other naming.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 8) replaced with separate 'agentId' (line 8) and 'name' (line 9) fields, adding unique identifier capability.",8,8
deductions,type_change,"Model specification evolved from simple 'model' string (line 9) to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10), suggesting deployment-aware model management.",9,10
deductions,structural_change,"Tools array structure modified: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array (line 10) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 11), currently empty across all agents.",10,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147, indicating this represents a different workflow instance rather than version evolution.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Agent IDs introduced in AAVA 2.0 (3885, 3474, 3545) provide unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",8,8
deductions,governance_issue,"Model version specification inconsistent: 'gpt-4' in AAVA 1.0 vs 'gpt-4.1' in AAVA 2.0 suggests model evolution but lacks version management metadata.",9,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool configuration degraded: AAVA 1.0 specifies 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' arrays, potentially breaking functionality.",10,11
deductions,naming_inconsistency,"Inconsistent camelCase usage: 'workFlowDetail' uses mixed case while other fields follow consistent patterns.",3,3
deductions,naming_inconsistency,"Agent naming inconsistency: underscores in AAVA 1.0 ('DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN') vs spaces in AAVA 2.0 ('DI Data Technical Specification SN').",8,9
deductions,risk,"Tool reference removal in AAVA 2.0 may break GitHub file writing functionality explicitly required in agent task descriptions.",10,11
deductions,risk,"Structural changes require significant code modifications in downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 flat structure.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Workflow ID change (1594 to 2147) may indicate these are different workflows rather than versions, raising questions about comparison validity.",2,3
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical organization.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types. No broken references or inconsistent structures detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced hierarchical organization.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2,"Minor inconsistency in camelCase usage ('workFlowDetail' vs standard camelCase) but does not affect JSON validity.",3,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents architectural maturation from simple workflow definition to enterprise-grade metadata with agent IDs and deployment-specific model references.",1,1
deductions,compatibility_assessment,"Breaking changes in structure require adapter layer for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format. Direct substitution not possible without code changes.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional equivalence despite structural differences.",15,15
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces enterprise features (agent IDs, deployment names) suggesting evolution toward production-grade metadata management.",8,8
