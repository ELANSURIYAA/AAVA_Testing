deduction,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The metadata shows enhanced organization with improved agent modeling but introduces breaking changes in field naming and structure that impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical agent purposes and business logic. Agent descriptions maintain semantic consistency across versions.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow structure with workflowId/workflowName, while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object. This represents architectural evolution but breaks structural compatibility.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"workflowId (1594) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2147). Semantic meaning preserved but field path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with minor formatting change: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore vs space).",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array. Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name in agent objects. Direct semantic mapping preserved.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with value evolution: 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'. Indicates model version upgrade.",7,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"tools array replaced with toolReferences array. AAVA 1.0 contains actual tool names ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] while AAVA 2.0 shows empty arrays [], indicating potential architectural change in tool handling.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"task object structure flattened in AAVA 2.0. task.description moved to direct description field, task.expectedOutput removed entirely.",9,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput field completely removed in AAVA 2.0, representing potential metadata degradation for agent output specifications.",,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but shows empty toolReferences arrays which may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version evolution from 1594 to 2147 suggests significant time gap and multiple iterations. Structural changes indicate major version bump warranted.",2,3
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata in AAVA 2.0 reduces governance quality and agent specification completeness.",9,
deduction,risk,"Structural field path changes (workflowId -> workFlowDetail.id, nodes -> workflowAgents) will break existing integrations and require code updates.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Tool handling architectural change (tools -> toolReferences with empty arrays) may indicate incomplete migration or breaking change in tool integration.",8,11
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are no longer used or migration is incomplete.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent (3 agents) with same functional purposes: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions maintain identical content and structure, preserving business logic and requirements specification.",9,11
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (1594) to integer (2147) - type preserved but value updated significantly.",2,3
