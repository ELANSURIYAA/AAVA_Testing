deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced agent metadata. AAVA 2.0 introduces improved organization and additional metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN maintains identical business purpose and agent functionality across both versions. Core workflow semantics preserved.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical restructuring with workFlowDetail container and enhanced agent metadata structure including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved with more descriptive naming.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8). Semantic meaning preserved with simplified naming.",6,8
deduction,field_addition,"New field agentId added in AAVA 2.0 (line 7) providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",,7
deduction,field_change,"Field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9) with value evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field tools (line 8) renamed to toolReferences (line 10) with structural change from array of strings to empty array.",8,10
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicating platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 eliminates tools array content while preserving toolReferences structure, suggesting architectural change in tool management.",8,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference DI_Github_File_Writer_Z present in AAVA 1.0 but absent in AAVA 2.0 toolReferences arrays, indicating potential functionality regression.",10,10
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 contains valid JSON structure with consistent field types and logical workflow organization.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 contains valid JSON structure but shows empty toolReferences arrays where tool functionality was previously defined.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat workflow structure to nested workFlowDetail container represents architectural improvement for metadata organization.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change requiring validation of tool functionality.",10,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences arrays represent intentional architectural change or incomplete data migration.",10,10
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain identical across versions indicating stable functional requirements despite structural evolution.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output specifications preserved exactly across both versions ensuring backward compatibility of deliverables.",50,50
