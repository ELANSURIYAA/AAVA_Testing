deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organizational structure and improved field naming conventions. Major structural changes include hierarchical reorganization and agent metadata enhancement.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved: both versions represent a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and functional testing. Business purpose and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' organization. This represents a significant architectural evolution.",3,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value format changed from underscore to space-separated format.",3,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' (line 4) to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). This improves semantic clarity and organizational hierarchy.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) within agent objects. Semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deductions,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' (line 7) added in AAVA 2.0 providing unique agent identification. This enhances metadata completeness.",N/A,7
deductions,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'. Indicates model version upgrade.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"Field 'tools' (line 8) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 10) and structure changed from array of strings to empty arrays. Indicates architectural shift in tool management.",8,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure completely reorganized. AAVA 1.0 uses nested 'task' object (line 9) while AAVA 2.0 flattens task description directly into agent object (line 10).",9,10
deductions,field_removal,"Field 'expectedOutput' removed from AAVA 2.0 agent structure. This represents metadata reduction that may impact documentation completeness.",N/A,N/A
deductions,type_change,"Tool references changed from populated string arrays in AAVA 1.0 to empty arrays in AAVA 2.0, indicating architectural evolution in tool management approach.",8,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Removal of 'expectedOutput' field reduces metadata governance quality by eliminating explicit output specifications for agents.",N/A,N/A
deductions,schema_evolution,"Overall schema evolution from flat to hierarchical structure improves organization but introduces breaking changes for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may break existing ETL pipelines, analytics queries, and governance tools that depend on AAVA 1.0 field paths and naming conventions.",N/A,N/A
deductions,risk,"Tool reference architecture change from populated arrays to empty arrays may indicate incomplete migration or architectural shift requiring validation.",8,10
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",N/A,N/A
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with improved hierarchical organization. All nested references are properly structured and consistent.",N/A,N/A
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve core workflow logic despite structural reorganization.",N/A,N/A
deductions,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain identical between versions, ensuring business logic preservation despite structural changes.",N/A,N/A
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are no longer needed or migration is incomplete.",N/A,10
