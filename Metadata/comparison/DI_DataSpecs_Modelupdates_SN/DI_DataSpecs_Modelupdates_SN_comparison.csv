deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and agent metadata enhancement. Moderate compatibility risks exist due to field renaming and structural changes.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concepts remain semantically consistent between versions. The DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains identical business purpose and agent functionality across both versions.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization with nested workFlowDetail object and enhanced agent metadata structure. This represents a major architectural evolution.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root level workflowId (1594) moved to nested workFlowDetail.id (2147) with value change indicating version evolution.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root level workflowName moved to nested workFlowDetail.name with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array maintaining same semantic purpose but different structural organization.",4,5
deduction,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name within agent objects. Semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with value evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"tools array replaced with toolReferences array. AAVA 1.0 contains string values while AAVA 2.0 shows empty arrays.",8,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Introduction of agentId field in AAVA 2.0 (values: 3885, 3474, 3545) adds unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,7
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes direct tool specification. First agent in AAVA 1.0 specifies DI_Github_File_Writer_Z tool which is absent in AAVA 2.0.",8,10
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates valid JSON structure with consistent field types and logical workflow organization. Minor issue: task.description contains formatting inconsistencies with mixed delimiter patterns.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON with enhanced structure. Issue: toolReferences arrays are empty across all agents, potentially indicating incomplete migration or intentional removal.",1,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Model version evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates infrastructure upgrade but may impact backward compatibility for dependent systems.",7,9
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization and field renaming pose moderate integration risks for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format. Migration strategy required.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete specification or architectural change requiring validation.",8,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 unclear whether represents same workflow evolution or different workflow instance.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain identical across versions indicating preserved functional requirements despite structural changes.",9,10
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count consistent (3 agents) with same core responsibilities: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases.",4,5
deduction,general_finding,"expectedOutput specifications remain unchanged indicating stable interface contracts despite internal structural evolution.",50,0
