deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates) but introduces enhanced organizational structure and modernized field naming conventions. Key changes include workflow metadata restructuring, agent identification improvements, and tool reference modernization.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent workflow for data integration specifications and model updates. Agent functionality remains semantically identical across versions.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent names maintain semantic consistency: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN with preserved meaning.",8,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions are semantically identical across all three agents, preserving business logic and requirements.",15,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' organization.",3,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: Simple workflowId/workflowName in v1 evolved to structured workFlowDetail object with id/name in v2.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata structure completely redesigned: v1 uses agentName/model/tools while v2 uses agentId/name/modelDeploymentName/toolReferences.",8,8
deduction,field_change,"Workflow naming convention updated: 'workflowName' (v1 line 3) renamed to 'name' within workFlowDetail object (v2 line 4).",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: 'agentName' (v1 line 8) replaced with 'agentId' and 'name' fields (v2 lines 8-9).",8,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification modernized: 'model' field (v1 line 9) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (v2 line 10).",9,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool reference structure changed: 'tools' array (v1 line 10) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (v2 line 82).",10,82
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID type consistency maintained: Both versions use integer type for workflow identification.",2,3
deduction,type_change,"Agent model specification enhanced: v1 uses simple string 'gpt-4' while v2 uses versioned string 'gpt-4.1'.",9,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint relaxed: v1 has populated tools array while v2 has empty toolReferences arrays, indicating possible constraint loosening.",10,82
deduction,missing_metadata,"Agent descriptions relocated: v1 embeds descriptions in task objects while v2 promotes descriptions to agent level, improving metadata accessibility.",15,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Inconsistent naming convention: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while workflowAgents uses different casing pattern, reducing naming consistency.",2,7
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference population inconsistency: First agent in v1 has populated tools while all agents in v2 have empty toolReferences, indicating incomplete migration.",10,82
deduction,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical organization improvement: v2 introduces better separation of concerns with workflow-level and agent-level metadata organization.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Agent identification enhancement: Addition of agentId provides unique identification capability absent in v1.",8,8
deduction,schema_evolution,"Model versioning improvement: v2 model specification includes version information (gpt-4.1 vs gpt-4) enabling better version tracking.",9,10
