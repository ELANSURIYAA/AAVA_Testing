deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced schema organization with agent-centric design while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve metadata governance.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical three-agent composition: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases agents. Core business logic and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization: workflow metadata moved from root level to nested workFlowDetail object, agents restructured from simple nodes array to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata including agentId and toolReferences.",3,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147. Semantic meaning preserved but breaks direct field mapping.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value normalization from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'. Underscores removed for readability.",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Agents array restructured from nodes (line 4) to workflowAgents (line 6) with enhanced schema. Each agent now includes agentId, explicit name field, and toolReferences array replacing simple tools array.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent names normalized: 'DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN' (line 6) becomes 'DI Data Technical Specification SN' (line 8). Underscores removed for consistency.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model field changed from 'gpt-4' (line 7) to modelDeploymentName 'gpt-4.1' (line 9). Field renamed and version updated indicating model evolution.",7,9
deduction,structural_change,"Tools array (line 8) replaced with toolReferences array (line 124). AAVA 1.0 used simple string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'], AAVA 2.0 uses empty array suggesting different tool management approach.",8,124
deduction,constraint_change,"Task structure remains identical in both versions but nested deeper in AAVA 2.0 agent objects. Description and expectedOutput fields preserved with identical content.",10,11
deduction,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes explicit tools references from first agent (originally 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z') without clear migration path. This could impact tool dependency tracking.",8,124
deduction,governance_issue,"Second and third agents in AAVA 1.0 had empty tools arrays, AAVA 2.0 maintains empty toolReferences arrays showing consistency in tool-less agents.",35,125
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent task descriptions remain byte-for-byte identical between versions, preserving all business logic, instructions, and output format requirements. No semantic drift detected in core functionality.",11,11
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization may break existing parsers expecting AAVA 1.0 schema. Migration requires field mapping: workflowId->workFlowDetail.id, workflowName->workFlowDetail.name, nodes->workflowAgents.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool reference changes could impact downstream systems expecting explicit tool arrays. Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate architectural shift requiring investigation.",8,124
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor version evolution with improved metadata organization. Enhanced agent schema with agentId enables better tracking and governance.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All agent definitions complete with proper task descriptions and tool references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure. All agent definitions complete with proper agentId assignment and consistent toolReferences schema.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve all critical metadata including task descriptions, expected outputs, and cost estimation requirements.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Model version progression from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents indicates coordinated model deployment upgrade in AAVA 2.0.",7,9
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool management strategy. Unclear if tools are managed elsewhere or deprecated.",124,124
