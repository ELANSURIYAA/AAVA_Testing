deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata organization with nested structures while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve data governance.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow concept preserved: workflowId/workflowName in v1 maps to workFlowDetail.id/name in v2 with identical semantic meaning.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent concepts maintained: nodes array in v1 corresponds to workflowAgents array in v2 representing same business entities.",4,6
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions remain semantically identical across both versions with preserved business logic and requirements.",12,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root-level restructuring: AAVA 2.0 introduces workFlowDetail wrapper object creating nested hierarchy vs flat structure in v1.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed: 'nodes' in v1 becomes 'workflowAgents' in v2 improving semantic clarity but breaking structural compatibility.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata enhanced: AAVA 2.0 adds agentId field and renames model to modelDeploymentName providing better identification.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools structure modified: 'tools' array in v1 becomes 'toolReferences' array in v2 suggesting reference-based architecture.",8,32
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID field: workflowId (v1 line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (v2 line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field: workflowName (v1 line 3) moved to workFlowDetail.name (v2 line 4) with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent name standardization: agentName in v1 becomes name in v2 with consistent naming pattern applied.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model field evolution: 'model' field in v1 becomes 'modelDeploymentName' in v2 with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Tools field restructuring: String array 'tools' in v1 becomes empty 'toolReferences' array in v2 indicating architectural shift.",8,32
deduction,constraint_change,"Task structure flattened: Nested task object in v1 (lines 9-11) becomes direct description field in v2 (line 10).",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output metadata removed: AAVA 2.0 eliminates expectedOutput field reducing documentation completeness.",50,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool specifications lost: Detailed tool configurations present in v1 are absent in v2 reducing operational metadata.",8,32
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced agent identification: Addition of agentId field in v2 improves entity tracking and referential integrity.",7,7
deduction,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical organization: Workflow details grouped under dedicated object improving logical structure and extensibility.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes detected: Structural reorganization requires updates to dependent systems and APIs consuming this metadata.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool reference architecture change may impact downstream automation and orchestration systems.",8,32
deduction,risk,"Field name changes without alias mapping could break existing data lineage and governance tools.",6,8
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural transition in progress.",32,32
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with proper nesting and consistent field types.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"All required workflow and agent metadata fields are present and properly formatted.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced organization and proper field typing.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while other fields use consistent naming patterns.",2,
deduction,general_finding,"Version evolution shows maturation from flat structure to hierarchical organization improving metadata governance.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Semantic preservation with structural enhancement indicates thoughtful schema evolution approach.",1,1
