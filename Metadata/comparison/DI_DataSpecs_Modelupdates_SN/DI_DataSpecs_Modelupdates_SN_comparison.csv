deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been reorganized with enhanced agent metadata and improved tool management. However structural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same business purpose across versions with identical agent functionality for data integration specifications and model updates.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically equivalent: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) preserve their core responsibilities and expected outputs.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure, representing architectural evolution.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates workflow metadata (id: 2147, name) from agent definitions, improving data organization and governance.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID changed: workflowId 1594 in v1 becomes id 2147 in v2, indicating version progression or environment difference.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name standardized: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' becomes 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' with space normalization.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent structure enhanced: 'agentName' becomes 'name' with addition of 'agentId' field providing unique identification.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification evolved: 'model' field becomes 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool management restructured: 'tools' array becomes 'toolReferences' array, currently empty but suggesting future tool association capability.",8,35
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent identification added: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId constraints (3885, 3474, 3545) enabling better agent lifecycle management.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Tool reference type modified: Tools changed from string array to object array structure, enabling richer tool metadata.",8,35
deduction,governance_issue,"Task descriptions identical: All agent task descriptions remain unchanged, maintaining functional consistency but missing governance versioning.",9,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications preserved: Output format requirements identical across versions, ensuring downstream compatibility.",50,25
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure valid: Proper JSON syntax, consistent field types, and logical agent-task relationships.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Agent definitions complete: All required fields present (agentName, model, tools, task) with consistent typing.",5,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure valid: Enhanced JSON syntax with proper nesting and field consistency.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Workflow detail structure complete: Proper separation of workflow metadata from agent definitions.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Agent references properly structured: AgentId fields provide unique identification with consistent numeric typing.",8,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes from flat to nested may require adapter patterns for existing consumers.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata governance: AAVA 2.0 structure supports better workflow and agent lifecycle management.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Breaking change potential: Field renames (agentName->name, model->modelDeploymentName) may impact existing integrations.",6,8
deduction,risk,"Tool integration uncertainty: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or future capability.",8,35
deduction,ambiguity,"Version progression unclear: Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 lacks clear versioning semantics.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation strong: Core agent descriptions and task specifications remain identical, ensuring functional continuity.",9,11
deduction,general_finding,"Architectural improvement: AAVA 2.0 structure better supports enterprise metadata management patterns.",1,1
