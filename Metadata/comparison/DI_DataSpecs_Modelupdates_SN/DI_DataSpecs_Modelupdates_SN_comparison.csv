deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced data organization. AAVA 2.0 introduces improved hierarchy and additional metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical across versions with consistent business logic and functionality.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'workflowId/workflowName' structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Array naming change: 'nodes' in v1 renamed to 'workflowAgents' in v2, improving semantic clarity.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Enhanced agent metadata: AAVA 2.0 adds 'agentId' field and restructures tool references as 'toolReferences' array.",5,8
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier: 'workflowId: 1594' (v1 line 2) restructured to 'workFlowDetail.id: 2147' (v2 line 3) with value change.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name: 'workflowName' (v1 line 3) moved to 'workFlowDetail.name' (v2 line 4) with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming: 'agentName' (v1 line 6) renamed to 'name' (v2 line 9) for consistency.",6,9
deductions,field_change,"Model specification: 'model: gpt-4' (v1 line 7) evolved to 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1' (v2 line 10) indicating version upgrade.",7,10
deductions,field_change,"Tool structure: 'tools' array (v1 line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (v2 line 11) with empty arrays in current data.",8,11
deductions,field_change,"Task structure: 'task' object (v1 line 9) replaced with 'description' field (v2 line 11) flattening the hierarchy.",9,11
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID data type preserved as integer but value changed from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint: AAVA 1.0 shows populated tools array while AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays.",8,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"Task metadata reduction: AAVA 2.0 removes 'expectedOutput' field present in all agents in AAVA 1.0.",10,12
deductions,missing_metadata,"Cost estimation sections completely removed in AAVA 2.0, present in all v1 agent tasks.",10,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degraded: removal of detailed task structure and expected output specifications reduces governance quality.",9,11
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool reference information lost: specific tool names like 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' removed in v2.",8,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Positive evolution: introduction of agentId provides better entity identification and traceability.",6,8
deductions,schema_evolution,"Structural improvement: nested workFlowDetail object provides better organization of workflow metadata.",2,2
deductions,risk,"Breaking change risk: structural reorganization may impact downstream systems expecting flat workflow structure.",2,2
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or tool configuration issues.",8,11
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility concern: field renames and structural changes require careful migration planning.",1,1
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear tool migration: whether tools were intentionally removed or migration is incomplete.",8,11
deductions,ambiguity,"Version numbering inconsistency: workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 without clear versioning strategy.",2,3
