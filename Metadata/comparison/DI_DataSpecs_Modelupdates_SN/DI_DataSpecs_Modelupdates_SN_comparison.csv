deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata organization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow metadata reorganization and agent reference architecture updates.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical business purpose and agent functionality. Core semantic meaning is preserved across all three agents.",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workflow organization with workFlowDetail container and workflowAgents array structure, replacing flat nodes array in v1.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved with structural reorganization.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Root array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved but naming convention updated.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8). Semantic meaning preserved with simplified naming.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9). Enhanced specificity in naming convention.",7,9
deductions,type_change,"Agent field 'tools' changed from string array (line 8) to 'toolReferences' empty array (line 11). Structural change affecting tool reference mechanism.",8,11
deductions,structural_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (line 7) not present in v1, adding unique agent identification capability.",0,7
deductions,structural_change,"Task object structure remains identical in both versions with same description and expectedOutput fields, maintaining functional consistency.",10,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Model version evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates deployment environment changes affecting model references.",7,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references mechanism changed from populated string array to empty array structure, potentially affecting tool integration.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates high structural correctness with valid JSON syntax, consistent field types, and logical workflow organization.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows minor correctness issues with empty toolReferences arrays and potential inconsistency in tool integration approach.",0,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat workflow structure to hierarchical organization represents major architectural evolution requiring downstream system updates.",1,2
deductions,risk,"Renamed fields and structural reorganization may break existing integrations and require comprehensive system updates across dependent services.",0,0
deductions,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays in v2 may indicate incomplete migration or changed tool integration architecture requiring validation.",0,11
deductions,compatibility_impact,"Field renaming and structural changes create backward compatibility challenges requiring mapping layers or migration scripts.",0,0
deductions,data_quality,"Both versions maintain consistent task descriptions and agent configurations with preserved business logic and functional requirements.",10,12
deductions,mapping_complexity,"One-to-one field mappings exist but require structural transformation due to hierarchical reorganization in AAVA 2.0.",0,0
