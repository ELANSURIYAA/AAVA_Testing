deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and metadata richness. Major structural changes include hierarchical reorganization and field renaming that may impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same core business concept of a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and test case generation. The business logic and agent purposes are semantically equivalent.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural changes: workflow metadata moved from flat properties to nested workFlowDetail object, nodes array renamed to workflowAgents, and agent structure enhanced with explicit IDs and model deployment names.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) - semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) - semantic meaning preserved with improved organization",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6) - more descriptive naming but breaks backward compatibility",4,6
deduction,structural_change,"Agent objects restructured: agentName becomes name, model becomes modelDeploymentName, tools array becomes toolReferences array",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer 1594 to 2147 - indicates different workflow instance or version evolution",2,3
deduction,enhancement,"AAVA 2.0 adds explicit agentId field for each agent providing unique identification not present in v1.0",6,8
deduction,enhancement,"Model field enhanced from simple string 'gpt-4' to more descriptive 'gpt-4.1' indicating version specificity",11,12
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed from string array to empty toolReferences array - may indicate architectural change in tool handling",12,89
deduction,governance_issue,"Task descriptions remain identical between versions indicating good semantic preservation but potential copy-paste without review",15,15
deduction,risk,"Structural changes in field names and object hierarchy may break existing integrations and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format",,
deduction,risk,"Tool handling changes from populated tools array to empty toolReferences may indicate incomplete migration or architectural shift",,
deduction,compatibility_concern,"No backward compatibility layer detected - systems expecting workflowId at root level will fail with AAVA 2.0 structure",,
deduction,data_quality,"Both versions maintain high internal consistency with no broken references or invalid JSON syntax",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with consistent field types and logical structure throughout",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 maintains excellent JSON syntax validity with enhanced structure and consistent field typing",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a minor-to-moderate version change with structural improvements but preserved business logic",1,1
deduction,migration_complexity,"Migration from v1.0 to v2.0 requires field mapping transformations and structural reorganization rather than simple field renames",,
deduction,recommendation,"Implement backward compatibility layer or provide clear migration documentation for systems dependent on AAVA 1.0 structure",,
deduction,recommendation,"Validate that empty toolReferences arrays are intentional and not indicative of incomplete data migration",,
