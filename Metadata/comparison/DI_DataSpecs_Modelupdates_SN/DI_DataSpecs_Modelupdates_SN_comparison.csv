deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include field renaming and hierarchical reorganization.",, 
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline with identical functional purposes and agent responsibilities.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical task description and expected output across versions, preserving business logic.",7,13
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete functional specification with identical DMEA process stages and capabilities.",51,32
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintains identical test case generation requirements and markdown output format.",52,53
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure reorganized: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with nested workFlowDetail.id/name (v2), increasing hierarchy depth.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents', improving semantic clarity but breaking backward compatibility.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification evolved: agentName (v1) to name+agentId (v2), adding unique identifier capability.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model reference enhanced: 'model' field (v1) replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' (v2), providing deployment-specific context.",7,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool reference structure changed: string array 'tools' (v1) to object array 'toolReferences' (v2), enabling richer tool metadata.",8,73
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID field renamed: workflowId (line 2) to workFlowDetail.id (line 3), semantic meaning preserved.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field relocated: workflowName (line 3) to workFlowDetail.name (line 4), hierarchical improvement.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent name field renamed: agentName to name, maintaining semantic equivalence.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model field enhanced: model to modelDeploymentName, adding deployment context.",7,10
deduction,type_change,"Tool references changed from string array to empty object array, enabling future extensibility.",8,73
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent identification constraint added: agentId field introduces unique identifier requirement in v2.",8,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tool references empty in v2: DI_Github_File_Writer_Z tool reference lost during migration.",9,73
deduction,governance_issue,"Field naming inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while maintaining consistency elsewhere.",2,2
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version 2.0 represents minor evolution with improved organization and extensibility without breaking core functionality.",, 
deduction,risk,"Tool reference migration risk: empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or intentional simplification.",, 
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: structural changes require adapter layer for systems expecting v1.0 format.",, 
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid: proper structure, balanced braces, correct comma placement throughout.",, 
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: all agent references properly structured with required fields.",, 
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid: proper nested structure, balanced braces, correct array formatting.",, 
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Internal consistency maintained: workflowAgents array properly structured with enhanced metadata.",, 
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical business logic and functional requirements within agent task descriptions.",, 
deduction,general_finding,"Structural evolution improves metadata organization while preserving essential workflow semantics.",,
