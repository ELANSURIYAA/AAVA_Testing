deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and modern naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. The transformation shows clear architectural improvements but introduces moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes align semantically: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN with identical functional requirements and output specifications.",6,10
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions maintain semantic equivalence: All three agents retain identical task descriptions, expected outputs, and processing logic between versions.",12,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' organization.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates workflow metadata (id, name) into dedicated 'workFlowDetail' object, improving data organization.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent structure modernized: AAVA 2.0 replaces 'agentName' with 'name' and 'agentId', adds 'modelDeploymentName' field, and restructures tool references.",6,10
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID changed: workflowId 1594 (v1) vs id 2147 (v2). Represents different workflow instances or versioning approach.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow naming standardized: 'workflowName' becomes 'name' with formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: Added 'agentId' field (3885, 3474, 3545) in AAVA 2.0 for unique agent identification.",6,10
deduction,field_change,"Model specification updated: 'model' field becomes 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",8,12
deduction,field_change,"Tool reference structure simplified: 'tools' array with string values replaced by empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0.",9,36
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent naming constraint relaxed: AAVA 2.0 removes underscores from agent names, adopting space-separated naming convention.",6,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure preserved: Both versions maintain identical 'task' object structure with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' fields.",11,15
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference degradation: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays, potentially indicating incomplete migration.",9,36
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution represents modernization: AAVA 2.0 introduces better separation of concerns with workflow-level and agent-level metadata organization.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes in field names and hierarchy may break existing integrations expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool integration risk: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete tool migration or configuration issues.",9,36
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and logical organization.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with improved hierarchical organization and consistent field types.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade: All agents upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating platform modernization.",8,12
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: All task descriptions, instructions, and expected outputs remain identical between versions, ensuring functional equivalence.",11,15
deduction,general_finding,"Metadata completeness: AAVA 2.0 adds agent IDs and deployment-specific model names, enhancing traceability and deployment management.",10,10
