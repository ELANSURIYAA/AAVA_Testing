deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced schema organization but removes critical task specification details affecting completeness.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline (Technical Specification -> Delta Model Changes -> Functional Test Cases). Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object and renames 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents'.",3,3
deductions,field_change,"Root workflow identifier changed from 'workflowId' (integer) to 'workFlowDetail.id' (integer). Semantic meaning preserved but access path modified.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name changed from 'workflowName' (string) to 'workFlowDetail.name' (string). Semantic meaning preserved but access path modified.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents'. Semantic meaning preserved but breaking change for dependent systems.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from 'agentName' to 'name'. Field semantics preserved but property name simplified.",6,9
deductions,field_addition,"New 'agentId' field added in AAVA 2.0 providing unique numeric identifier (3885, 3474, 3545) for each agent.",0,8
deductions,field_change,"Model reference changed from 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName'. Semantic meaning preserved but property name enhanced for clarity.",7,10
deductions,type_change,"Model version upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents. Represents model evolution but maintains compatibility.",7,10
deductions,field_change,"Tool references restructured from 'tools' (string array) to 'toolReferences' (empty arrays). Semantic meaning preserved but implementation changed.",8,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"Critical 'task' object completely removed in AAVA 2.0. This object contained 'description' and 'expectedOutput' specifications essential for agent execution.",9,0
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' specifications in AAVA 2.0 reduces metadata completeness and may impact downstream validation systems.",0,0
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has empty 'toolReferences' arrays suggesting incomplete migration or intentional simplification.",0,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution (v1 -> v2) with breaking changes requiring migration scripts for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Renamed fields without alias mapping may break existing analytics pipelines and governance tools expecting AAVA 1.0 structure.",0,0
deductions,risk,"Removal of 'task.expectedOutput' specifications may impact automated validation and quality assurance processes.",0,0
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are no longer needed or migration is incomplete.",0,11
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions indicating preserved functional requirements despite structural changes.",9,11
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147 suggesting this represents a different workflow instance rather than pure version evolution.",2,3
