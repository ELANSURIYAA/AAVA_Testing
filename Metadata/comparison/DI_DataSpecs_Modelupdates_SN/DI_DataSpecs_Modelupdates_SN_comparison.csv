deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution but preserved semantic meaning. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced object modeling and improved field naming conventions while maintaining functional equivalence.",,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI DataSpecs Modelupdates workflow with identical agent purposes and functionality. Core business meaning is preserved across the evolution.",2,4
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN in v1 maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN in v2 with identical functional requirements and task descriptions.",6,9
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN in v1 maps to DI Delta Model Changes SN in v2 with preserved DMEA functionality and identical process stages.",32,19
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN in v1 maps to DI Functional Test Cases SN in v2 with identical test case generation requirements.",58,29
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: v1 uses flat 'nodes' array while v2 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' object with nested 'workflowAgents' array.",3,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved from simple workflowId/workflowName pair to structured workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent representation changed from agentName to name field, and introduced agentId for unique identification.",6,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model specification evolved from 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' with version specification (gpt-4 vs gpt-4.1).",7,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools architecture completely restructured: v1 uses 'tools' string array, v2 uses 'toolReferences' empty array structure.",8,39
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure flattened: v1 nests task under 'task' object, v2 moves description directly to agent level.",9,12
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value normalization from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) maintaining array structure but changing element schema.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' across all agents with underscore removal in naming convention.",6,10
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' showing evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,11
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID maintains integer type but value changed from 1594 to 2147 indicating different workflow instances.",2,3
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification evolved from string-based 'agentName' to integer 'agentId' plus string 'name' combination.",6,9
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools constraint relaxed: v1 requires string array with actual tool names, v2 uses empty 'toolReferences' array.",8,39
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure metadata lost: v1 includes 'expectedOutput' field for each agent, completely absent in v2.",30,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tool integration metadata degraded: v1 specifies actual tool names like 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z', v2 has empty toolReferences arrays.",8,39
deduction,governance_issue,"Inconsistent naming conventions: v1 uses underscores (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN), v2 uses spaces (DI Data Technical Specification SN).",6,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications removed in v2 reducing metadata completeness for downstream consumers.",30,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with proper structure, consistent field types, and complete agent definitions.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has incomplete tool references and missing expected output specifications.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a major version change with breaking structural changes requiring downstream system updates.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in object hierarchy may impact existing parsers expecting 'nodes' array structure.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Tool integration points undefined in v2 may break automated workflow execution systems.",8,39
deduction,risk,"Missing expected output specifications may impact validation and quality assurance processes.",30,
deduction,ambiguity,"Relationship between agentId values and agent ordering unclear in v2 structure.",9,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical functional descriptions ensuring business continuity despite structural changes.",9,12
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution alongside metadata schema changes.",7,11
