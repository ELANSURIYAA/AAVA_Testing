deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate schema evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata structure while preserving core semantic meaning.",,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical agent purposes and task descriptions.",1,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical task description and expected outputs across both versions.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete task specification and functionality definition.",35,45
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains identical instructions and output format requirements.",65,75
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification evolved from simple 'agentName' to structured approach with 'agentId' and 'name' fields.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (1594) moved from root level to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (2147).",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents'.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' across all agents.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification changed from 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' introduced for each agent (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identification.",0,8
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'toolReferences' introduced as empty array, replacing the populated 'tools' array structure.",0,105
deduction,field_removal,"Field 'tools' array removed from all agents, previously containing tool references like 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'.",8,0
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool specification mechanism changed from direct tool names in 'tools' array to empty 'toolReferences' array structure.",8,105
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of explicit tool mapping: AAVA 1.0 clearly specified 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool for first agent, AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences.",8,105

deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"All agent references properly structured with new schema (agentId, name, modelDeploymentName, toolReferences).",0,8
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Minor inconsistency: empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or intentional tool decoupling.",0,105
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a major version change with breaking structural modifications requiring dependent system updates.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Breaking change: systems expecting 'nodes' array will fail when processing AAVA 2.0 structure.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Tool integration risk: removal of explicit tool mappings may impact workflow execution capabilities.",8,105
deduction,risk,"ID change from 1594 to 2147 may break workflow tracking and lineage systems.",2,3
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences indicates intentional decoupling or incomplete migration from tools array.",8,105
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces more structured metadata approach with unique agent IDs and deployment-specific model naming.",0,8
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform evolution.",7,9
