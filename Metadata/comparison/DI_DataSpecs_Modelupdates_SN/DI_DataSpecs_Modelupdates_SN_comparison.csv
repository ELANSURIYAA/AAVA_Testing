deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced data organization. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more hierarchical approach with improved agent metadata management while preserving core semantic meaning.",,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN preserved across both versions with identical business purpose and agent functionality.",3,4
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents maintain identical descriptions and core responsibilities: technical specification creation, delta model changes, and functional test case generation.",,
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces workFlowDetail nested object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure, increasing hierarchy depth.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent structure completely reorganized from nodes array to workflowAgents array with enhanced metadata fields.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"New agentId field introduced in AAVA 2.0 providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",,8
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value change from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6) maintaining array structure but changing element organization.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 9) within agent objects.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 10) with value updates from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Field tools (line 8) replaced with toolReferences (line 12) changing from string array to empty array structure.",8,12
deduction,type_change,"Tools field changed from populated string array [DI_Github_File_Writer_Z] to empty toolReferences array, indicating architectural shift in tool management.",8,12
deduction,constraint_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId as required field for each agent, adding new constraint not present in AAVA 1.0.",,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Model version evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform upgrade but may impact backward compatibility.",7,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference mechanism changed from direct tool names to empty references, potentially indicating incomplete migration or architectural change.",8,12
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with breaking changes in field names, structure hierarchy, and agent identification.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Renamed fields without alias mapping may break existing downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 field names.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration from tools array structure.",8,12
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 may impact systems using workflow ID for tracking and lineage.",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and complete field population.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but contains empty toolReferences arrays that may indicate incomplete data.",1,12
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expectedOutput specifications, ensuring functional consistency.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent at 3 agents across both versions with preserved agent functionality.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata structure with agentId and improved naming conventions for better governance.",8,8
