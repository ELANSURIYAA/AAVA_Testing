deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been restructured from a flat schema to a nested hierarchical model with enhanced agent metadata. While business logic and agent descriptions remain largely intact, the structural reorganization introduces moderate compatibility risks for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same purpose and agent functionality across versions.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN: Task descriptions and expected outputs are semantically identical with minor formatting differences.",8,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN: Core DMEA functionality and process stages remain unchanged semantically.",35,25
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN: Test case generation requirements and output formats preserved.",60,40
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 flat 'nodes' array replaced with nested 'workflowAgents' structure in AAVA 2.0.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification restructured: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with workFlowDetail object containing id/name (v2).",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata enhanced: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId, explicit toolReferences array, and modelDeploymentName fields.",8,8
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) - semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) - semantic meaning preserved.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes array (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6) - represents same agent collection.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"agentName (line 8) renamed to name (line 8) - simplified field naming.",8,8
deductions,type_change,"model field changed from simple string 'gpt-4' to structured modelDeploymentName 'gpt-4.1' indicating version evolution.",9,9
deductions,constraint_change,"tools array in AAVA 1.0 (line 10) replaced with empty toolReferences array in AAVA 2.0 - potential functionality impact.",10,45
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (line 7) not present in AAVA 1.0 - enhances agent identification.",7,7
deductions,governance_issue,"Task descriptions contain identical content but AAVA 2.0 removes tool specifications, potentially impacting agent execution capabilities.",10,45
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents minor version upgrade with backward compatibility concerns due to structural changes.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Dependent systems expecting flat 'nodes' structure may break when processing AAVA 2.0 nested 'workflowAgents' format.",4,6
deductions,risk,"Tool references removal in AAVA 2.0 may impact agent execution if downstream systems rely on explicit tool declarations.",10,45
deductions,ambiguity,"workFlowDetail naming inconsistency: camelCase 'workFlowDetail' vs expected 'workflowDetail' introduces minor naming convention deviation.",2,2
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and proper array/object nesting.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required workflow metadata present: workflowId (1594), workflowName, and complete nodes array with 3 agents.",2,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Agent definitions complete with agentName, model, tools array, and comprehensive task descriptions.",8,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced nested object organization.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"workFlowDetail object properly structured with id (2147) and name fields.",2,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"workflowAgents array contains 3 complete agent definitions with enhanced metadata including agentId and modelDeploymentName.",6,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional equivalence.",11,10
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced agent identification through agentId field, improving traceability.",7,7
deductions,general_finding,"Model evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform advancement while maintaining compatibility.",9,9
