deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been reorganized from a flat nodes array to a hierarchical workFlowDetail + workflowAgents structure. Agent definitions maintain functional equivalence but with enhanced metadata organization.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow functionality preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same three agents with identical business purposes - technical specification generation, delta model changes, and functional test case creation.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain functionally identical across versions, preserving business logic and requirements. No semantic drift detected in core functionality.",8,13
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array (line 3) while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure (lines 2-6), increasing hierarchy depth and improving metadata organization.",3,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates workflow metadata (id: 2147, name) from agent definitions, improving data model normalization compared to AAVA 1.0's embedded approach.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root workflow identifier renamed: 'workflowId' (line 2) becomes nested under 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3), maintaining semantic meaning but changing access path.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field renamed: 'workflowName' (line 3) becomes 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with slight formatting change from underscore to camelCase.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (line 4) becomes 'workflowAgents' array (line 6), improving semantic clarity and self-documentation.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming convention updated: 'agentName' (line 6) becomes 'name' (line 8), simplifying field naming within agent context.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'model' field (line 7) becomes 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9), providing more specific deployment context.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification added: AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field (line 7) providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",7,7
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools reference structure modified: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array with string values (line 8) becomes 'toolReferences' empty array (line 74), potentially indicating architectural change in tool management.",8,74
deduction,type_change,"Model version updated: 'gpt-4' (line 7) upgraded to 'gpt-4.1' (lines 9, 35, 61) across all agents, indicating platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,governance_issue,"Task structure remains nested but field organization unchanged, maintaining complexity in both versions without governance improvement.",9,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor version evolution with improved data model normalization, enhanced metadata organization, and clearer semantic field naming.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact downstream systems expecting flat 'nodes' array structure, requiring adapter patterns or migration scripts for dependent applications.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Tool reference architecture change from populated array to empty 'toolReferences' suggests potential breaking change in tool integration patterns.",8,74
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool integration approach compared to explicit tool names in AAVA 1.0.",8,74
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure, proper nesting, and no orphaned references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with improved normalization, consistent field naming, and logical hierarchy.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional continuity despite structural evolution.",9,10
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow execution logic preserved across versions with enhanced metadata organization in AAVA 2.0 supporting better governance and traceability.",1,1
