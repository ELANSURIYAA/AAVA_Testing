deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and minor semantic drift. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced hierarchy and modernized field naming while preserving core business logic.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow concept preserved: workflowName (v1) maps to workFlowDetail.name (v2) with identical semantic meaning for DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN workflow.",3,4
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent concepts maintained: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) preserve identical business purposes and descriptions.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Model evolution detected: gpt-4 (v1) upgraded to gpt-4.1 (v2) representing version advancement without semantic change.",8,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: Flat nodes array (v1) replaced with hierarchical workFlowDetail + workflowAgents structure (v2).",4,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: Simple workflowId/workflowName (v1) evolved to structured workFlowDetail object with id/name properties (v2).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent structure modernized: agentName (v1) renamed to name (v2), added agentId field for enhanced identification.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: workflowId (v1 line 2) changed to workFlowDetail.id (v2 line 3) - numeric values differ (1594 vs 2147).",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: workflowName (v1 line 3) changed to workFlowDetail.name (v2 line 4) - values semantically identical but formatting differs.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: nodes (v1 line 4) changed to workflowAgents (v2 line 6) - array structure preserved.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: agentName (v1 line 7) changed to name (v2 line 9) - values identical across all agents.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: model (v1 line 8) changed to modelDeploymentName (v2 line 10) - semantic meaning preserved.",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Field restructured: tools array (v1 line 9) replaced with empty toolReferences array (v2 line 12) - represents structural change.",9,12
deduction,field_change,"Field flattened: task.description (v1 line 11) moved to description (v2 line 11) - content preserved but structure simplified.",11,11
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID type preserved: Both versions use integer type for workflow identification.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint changed: v1 contains actual tool names in array, v2 has empty toolReferences arrays.",9,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure simplified: expectedOutput field removed from v2, reducing metadata completeness for agent output specifications.",35,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference degradation: Specific tool names (DI_Github_File_Writer_Z) lost in v2 transition to empty toolReferences.",9,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications removed: v2 lacks detailed output format requirements present in v1.",35,
