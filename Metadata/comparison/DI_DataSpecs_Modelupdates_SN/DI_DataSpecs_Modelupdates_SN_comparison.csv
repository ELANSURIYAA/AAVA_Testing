deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and enhanced agent modeling. The evolution introduces improved metadata governance but creates backward compatibility challenges.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN) remains semantically identical between versions. All three agents maintain equivalent functional descriptions and objectives.",3,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN preserves identical task description and expected outputs across both versions, maintaining semantic consistency.",8,15
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN retains identical functional specification and processing logic in both versions.",50,35
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintains consistent test case generation requirements and output format specifications.",80,55
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' to structured 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent modeling evolved from simple 'agentName' to comprehensive 'agentId', 'name', and 'modelDeploymentName' structure.",8,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools reference system completely restructured: AAVA 1.0 uses 'tools' array with string values, AAVA 2.0 uses 'toolReferences' array (currently empty).",12,80
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure flattened in AAVA 2.0: 'task.description' and 'task.expectedOutput' merged into single 'description' field.",13,20
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Introduces camelCase inconsistency in AAVA 2.0.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field 'agentName' (line 8) renamed to 'name' (line 16). Simplified naming but loses semantic specificity.",8,16
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 9) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 17). Enhanced semantic clarity and specificity.",9,17
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhanced from simple string 'gpt-4' to versioned 'gpt-4.1' indicating deployment evolution.",9,17
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools constraint removed: AAVA 1.0 requires tools specification, AAVA 2.0 makes toolReferences optional (empty arrays).",12,80
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure metadata lost: AAVA 2.0 eliminates 'task' wrapper and 'expectedOutput' separation, reducing metadata granularity.",13,20
deduction,governance_issue,"Naming convention inconsistency introduced in AAVA 2.0: 'workFlowDetail' uses PascalCase while 'workflowAgents' uses camelCase.",2,5
deduction,governance_issue,"Agent identification system changed from name-based to ID-based, potentially breaking existing references and lineage tracking.",8,15
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents major version evolution with breaking changes to object hierarchy and field access patterns.",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool integration model compared to explicit tool specifications in AAVA 1.0.",12,80
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility severely impacted: existing systems parsing AAVA 1.0 structure will fail on AAVA 2.0 without significant code changes.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Data migration complexity high due to structural reorganization requiring field mapping and hierarchy transformation.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool integration model unclear in AAVA 2.0 may impact downstream automation and orchestration systems.",12,80
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with consistent field types and proper nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"All required fields present with appropriate data types: workflowId (integer), workflowName (string), nodes (array).",2,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Agent definitions complete with all necessary attributes: agentName, model, tools, task structure.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Task descriptions properly structured with separate description and expectedOutput fields maintaining clear separation of concerns.",13,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure is syntactically valid with enhanced object modeling and proper type consistency.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Workflow detail object properly structured with id (integer) and name (string) maintaining data type consistency.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Agent objects enhanced with agentId (integer), name (string), and modelDeploymentName (string) providing comprehensive identification.",15,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"ToolReferences arrays properly initialized as empty arrays maintaining structural consistency across all agents.",80,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve all functional descriptions without content loss.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Model versioning evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform advancement and deployment sophistication.",9,17
deduction,general_finding,"Structural evolution suggests migration toward more enterprise-grade metadata management with enhanced governance capabilities.",1,1
