deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced schema organization with nested objects and improved field naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. The evolution shows good governance practices but introduces moderate structural changes that may impact dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical agent purposes and task descriptions.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 1 (Technical Specification): Identical task descriptions and output requirements across both versions. Business logic and functionality remain unchanged.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 2 (Delta Model Changes): Task descriptions are identical, preserving the DMEA (Data Model Evolution Agent) functionality and workflow stages.",47,29
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 3 (Functional Test Cases): Complete preservation of test case generation requirements and markdown output format specifications.",49,51
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0's nested 'workFlowDetail' + 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",4,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced by workFlowDetail.id/name object structure (v2).",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent representation changed: flat node objects (v1) vs structured agent objects with agentId field (v2).",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,4
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 5). Introduces object nesting for workflow metadata.",3,5
deduction,field_change,"Field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 7). More descriptive naming but changes API contract.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 9). Simplified naming within agent context.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10). More descriptive but longer field name.",7,10
deduction,type_change,"Model specification changed from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'. Represents version upgrade with potential compatibility implications.",7,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools handling restructured: 'tools' array with string values (v1) replaced by empty 'toolReferences' arrays (v2).",8,12
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references lost: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool, AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays.",8,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference degradation: Loss of explicit tool mappings in AAVA 2.0 reduces metadata completeness and may impact workflow execution.",8,12
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure preserved: Both versions maintain 'description' field with identical content, ensuring functional continuity.",9,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications: AAVA 1.0 includes 'expectedOutput' field (line 10) which is absent in AAVA 2.0, reducing specification completeness.",10,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Addition of agentId field in AAVA 2.0 (line 8) introduces unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",8
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes: Structural reorganization may require updates to dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 schema format.",
deduction,risk,"Tool reference loss: Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or missing tool mapping logic.",
deduction,ambiguity,"Model version change from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' unclear if intentional upgrade or migration artifact requiring validation.",
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid: Proper structure with balanced braces, correct array notation, and valid string escaping.",
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: All agent references, task descriptions, and tool mappings are logically consistent.",
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid: Well-formed nested structure with proper object hierarchy and array formatting.",
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Minor consistency issue: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete specification or missing tool mapping data.",
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow evolution shows mature schema design practices with improved naming conventions and hierarchical organization.",
deduction,general_finding,"Semantic preservation is strong with 85% alignment, indicating successful migration of business logic and requirements.",
deduction,general_finding,"Structural changes are significant (70% similarity) but follow logical evolution patterns for improved metadata organization."
