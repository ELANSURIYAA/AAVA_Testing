deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and agent definition format changes that impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains consistent - both versions define a data integration workflow for technical specifications and model updates. Agent functionality and business objectives are preserved.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workflow structure with workFlowDetail wrapper and workflowAgents array, departing from flat nodes array structure in AAVA 1.0.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with format change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container changed from 'nodes' array (line 4) to 'workflowAgents' array (line 6) indicating conceptual shift in agent modeling.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) removing semantic prefix.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"New field 'agentId' introduced in AAVA 2.0 (line 7) providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",N/A,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools structure completely reorganized from 'tools' array with string values (line 8) to 'toolReferences' empty array (line 11) indicating architectural change.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Agent task structure flattened from nested 'task' object (line 9) to direct 'description' field (line 10) removing task metadata wrapper.",9,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes 'expectedOutput' field present in all AAVA 1.0 agents, reducing metadata completeness for output specifications.",N/A,N/A
deduction,type_change,"Tools reference mechanism changed from populated string array to empty array structure, suggesting different tool integration approach.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of detailed task structure including expectedOutput reduces governance metadata and specification completeness in AAVA 2.0.",N/A,N/A
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents major version evolution with breaking changes requiring migration strategy for dependent systems.",N/A,N/A
deduction,risk,"Structural reorganization may break existing integrations expecting flat workflow structure and specific field names from AAVA 1.0.",N/A,N/A
deduction,risk,"Removal of tools array content and expectedOutput fields may impact systems relying on complete agent specifications.",N/A,N/A
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and complete agent definitions including all required metadata fields.",N/A,N/A
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with well-formed hierarchical structure, though some metadata fields are simplified or removed.",N/A,N/A
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions indicating preserved functional requirements despite structural changes.",N/A,N/A
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent at 3 agents across both versions maintaining workflow scope.",N/A,N/A
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool integration approach compared to explicit tool names in AAVA 1.0.",N/A,N/A
