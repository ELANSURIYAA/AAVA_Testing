deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution of the workflow metadata with enhanced agent modeling and improved data organization. While semantic meaning is largely preserved, the structural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN maintains identical business meaning across both versions with consistent agent purposes and task descriptions.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN preserves identical functional requirements and output specifications in both versions.",11,15
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN maintains consistent data model evolution capabilities and processing logic.",65,39
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains identical test case generation requirements and markdown output format.",120,67
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces nested object hierarchy with workFlowDetail container vs flat structure in AAVA 1.0.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from nodes to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata fields.",4,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Addition of agentId field provides unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",11,15

deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools array replaced with toolReferences array structure for improved referential integrity.",13,95
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (line 2) renamed to id (line 3) - semantic meaning preserved.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName (line 3) renamed to name (line 4) - semantic meaning preserved.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 7) - improved semantic clarity.",4,7
deductions,field_change,"agentName (line 11) renamed to name (line 16) - simplified naming convention.",11,16
deductions,field_change,"model (line 12) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 17) - enhanced specificity.",12,17
deductions,field_change,"tools (line 13) replaced with toolReferences (line 95) - structural improvement.",13,95
deductions,type_change,"Model version upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents - indicates platform evolution.",12,17

deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 1.0 tools array contains explicit tool names while AAVA 2.0 toolReferences is empty array.",13,95
deductions,governance_issue,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147 without clear versioning strategy documentation.",2,3
deductions,governance_issue,"Agent naming convention inconsistency: underscores vs spaces in agent names.",11,16
deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of nested workFlowDetail object represents major schema evolution requiring adapter logic.",2,2
