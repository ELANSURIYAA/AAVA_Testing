deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced organization. AAVA 2.0 introduces improved hierarchy and agent management while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and test case generation.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same functional objectives.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions are functionally equivalent with identical business requirements and processing logic across both versions.",12,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates workflow metadata (id: 2147, name) from agent definitions, improving organizational clarity.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent representation evolved: AAVA 1.0 'agentName' becomes 'name' in AAVA 2.0 with addition of 'agentId' for unique identification.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID changed: AAVA 1.0 'workflowId: 1594' vs AAVA 2.0 'id: 2147' - indicates version progression or environment difference.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name formatting: AAVA 1.0 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs AAVA 2.0 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' - underscore to space conversion.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Model specification enhanced: AAVA 1.0 'model: gpt-4' becomes 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification added: AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field (3885, 3474, 3545) for unique agent tracking not present in AAVA 1.0.",8,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools reference mechanism changed: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array with string values replaced by AAVA 2.0 'toolReferences' empty arrays, suggesting different tool management approach.",9,12
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool configuration simplified: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays, potentially indicating centralized tool management.",9,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Task structure preservation: Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional continuity despite structural changes.",12,15
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata organization: AAVA 2.0 structure better supports workflow management with clear separation of concerns between workflow and agent metadata.",1,2
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility concern: Structural changes from flat 'nodes' to nested 'workflowAgents' may require downstream system updates for parsing logic.",5,7
deduction,risk,"Tool integration impact: Change from explicit tool listing to empty toolReferences may affect tool dependency resolution in dependent systems.",9,12
deduction,general_finding,"Model upgrade detected: GPT-4 to GPT-4.1 upgrade suggests improved AI capabilities while maintaining functional compatibility.",8,11
deduction,general_finding,"Naming convention evolution: Systematic replacement of underscores with spaces in workflow names indicates standardization effort.",3,4
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count consistency: Both versions maintain exactly three agents with identical functional roles and processing sequences.",5,7
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 1.0 is well-formed JSON with proper nesting, brackets, and comma placement throughout all 95+ lines.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency check: All agent references, tool names, and workflow IDs are internally consistent within AAVA 1.0 structure.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 2.0 is well-formed JSON with proper object hierarchy and array structures across all elements.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Schema consistency: Agent IDs, workflow details, and nested structures maintain logical relationships and referential integrity.",2,
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference interpretation: Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about actual tool dependencies compared to explicit AAVA 1.0 tool listing.",9,12
