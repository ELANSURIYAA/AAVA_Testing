deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent largely the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and moderate governance changes. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced agent modeling with numeric IDs and restructured tool references while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN with identical functional descriptions.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow naming evolution: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' becomes 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' with space normalization but preserved meaning.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0 nested 'workFlowDetail' + 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",4,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification change: workflowId (1594) + workflowName becomes workFlowDetail.id (2147) + workFlowDetail.name structure.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent modeling evolution: flat agentName becomes structured agentId + name with numeric identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545).",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure elimination: AAVA 1.0 nested task.description + task.expectedOutput flattened to agent-level description in AAVA 2.0.",10,12
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change 1594 -> 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with formatting change.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) maintaining array structure.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'agentName' renamed to 'name' with addition of numeric 'agentId' field.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field renamed: 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10) with version evolution gpt-4 -> gpt-4.1.",7,10
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgrade: 'gpt-4' upgraded to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents indicating platform evolution.",7,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool reference mechanism changed: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array with string values vs AAVA 2.0 empty 'toolReferences' arrays.",8,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure removed: AAVA 2.0 eliminates nested task.description and task.expectedOutput, flattening to agent-level description.",10,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications lost: Detailed output format requirements present in AAVA 1.0 task.expectedOutput not preserved in AAVA 2.0.",45,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference degradation: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists tool dependencies ('DI_Github_File_Writer_Z') while AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences arrays.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness reduced: Loss of structured task definitions may impact downstream automation and validation systems.",10,12
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax valid: Well-formed JSON with consistent structure and proper nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: All agent references, tool dependencies, and task structures are logically consistent.",6,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Minor formatting inconsistency: Mixed use of underscores in field names (workflowId vs workflow_name pattern).",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax valid: Well-formed JSON with proper structure and nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Structural consistency: workFlowDetail and workflowAgents maintain logical relationships.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Empty tool references: All toolReferences arrays are empty, potentially indicating incomplete migration or architectural change.",11,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Naming inconsistency: Mixed camelCase (workFlowDetail) and camelCase (workflowAgents) patterns.",3,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Major version evolution: Structural changes suggest AAVA 2.0 represents significant architectural advancement rather than incremental update.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes in workflow and agent modeling may break existing integrations.",4,6
deduction,schema_evolution,"Data model maturation: Introduction of numeric IDs and structured hierarchies indicates platform maturation.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Integration impact: Downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 'nodes' structure will require updates for AAVA 2.0 'workflowAgents'.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Tool dependency resolution: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or require alternative resolution mechanism.",8,11
deduction,risk,"Metadata loss: Elimination of task.expectedOutput may impact systems relying on detailed output specifications.",45,12
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference interpretation: Unclear whether empty toolReferences arrays indicate no tools needed or incomplete data migration.",8,11
deduction,ambiguity,"ID relationship mapping: No explicit mapping provided between AAVA 1.0 workflow ID 1594 and AAVA 2.0 ID 2147.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: Core agent descriptions and functional requirements preserved with high fidelity between versions.",10,12
deduction,general_finding,"Architectural evolution: AAVA 2.0 demonstrates clear progression toward more structured, ID-based metadata management.",1,1
