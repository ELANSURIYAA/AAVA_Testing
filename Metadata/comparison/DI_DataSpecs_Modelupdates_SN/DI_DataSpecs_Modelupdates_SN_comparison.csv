deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model but with significant structural reorganization and enhanced metadata richness in AAVA 2.0. While semantic meaning is largely preserved, the architectural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and functional testing.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same business objectives.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 separates workflow metadata (id: 2147, name) from agent definitions, improving data model normalization.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) maintaining same semantic purpose but different structural context.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) within agent objects, simplifying naming convention.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' field (line 7) providing unique numeric identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545) absent in AAVA 1.0.",6,7
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure modified: AAVA 1.0 uses string array 'tools' (line 8) while AAVA 2.0 uses object array 'toolReferences' (line 10) with empty arrays.",8,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task object structure preserved: Both versions maintain identical 'task' objects with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' fields containing same business logic.",9,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Model versioning inconsistency: Agent models upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' but without explicit version migration documentation.",7,9
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference degradation: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' arrays, potentially indicating tool configuration loss.",8,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata model: AAVA 2.0 introduces agent-centric design with unique identifiers and deployment-specific model names, supporting better workflow orchestration.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes from flat to nested hierarchy may break existing parsers and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool configuration risk: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or tool binding issues affecting agent execution capabilities.",8,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow naming inconsistency: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' introduces potential identifier matching issues.",3,4
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: All task descriptions and expected outputs remain identical between versions, ensuring business logic continuity.",9,11
deduction,general_finding,"JSON syntax validation: Both versions are syntactically valid JSON with proper structure and no parsing errors.",1,1
deduction,correctness_analysis,"AAVA 1.0 correctness: Valid JSON structure, consistent field types, no orphaned references, logical workflow sequence maintained. Score: 95/100.",1,1
deduction,correctness_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 correctness: Valid JSON structure, enhanced with proper normalization, consistent field types, no orphaned references. Score: 95/100.",1,1
deduction,correctness_analysis,"Minor correctness deduction: Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 suggest incomplete configuration migration from AAVA 1.0's populated tools array.",8,10
