deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been restructured with enhanced hierarchy and agent metadata but introduces some compatibility concerns.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications model updates and functional testing. Business purpose remains identical.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes maintain semantic alignment: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN agent retains same core responsibility for creating technical specification documents from JIRA Confluence DDL inputs.",8,7
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN agent preserves data model evolution analysis functionality across both versions with identical business logic requirements.",45,28
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN agent maintains same test case generation responsibilities from JIRA specifications in both versions.",83,56
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object hierarchy.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier restructured: workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name restructured: workflowName (line 3) moved to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with formatting change from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructuring: AAVA 1.0 'nodes' array (line 4) replaced with 'workflowAgents' array (line 6) indicating semantic shift from generic nodes to specific agent entities.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming evolution: agentName field (line 6) replaced with name field (line 8) removing 'agent' prefix for cleaner naming convention.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Model specification enhancement: model field (line 7) replaced with modelDeploymentName (line 9) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tool reference restructuring: tools array (line 8) replaced with toolReferences array (line 11) suggesting shift from direct tool embedding to reference-based architecture.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool array content change: AAVA 1.0 contains 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 toolReferences array is empty indicating potential tool configuration externalization.",9,11
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification enhancement: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (line 7) providing unique numeric identifiers (3885 3474 3545) absent in AAVA 1.0.",6,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure preserved: Both versions maintain identical task object structure with description and expectedOutput fields containing same detailed specifications.",10,10
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper bracket closure array formatting and string escaping. No syntax errors detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 internal consistency: All agent references tools and task structures are logically consistent. No orphaned references or type mismatches.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper nested object hierarchy and array formatting. No syntax errors detected.",1,1
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 internal consistency: Agent IDs are unique toolReferences arrays are properly initialized and workFlowDetail structure is logically sound.",1,1
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 minor inconsistency: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or externalized tool configuration which may impact runtime behavior.",11,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility risk: Field name changes (workflowId to workFlowDetail.id agentName to name) may break existing parsers and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 structure.",2,3
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata versioning concern: No explicit version indicators in either schema making it difficult to programmatically distinguish AAVA 1.0 from AAVA 2.0 at runtime.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Tool configuration gap: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 compared to populated tools array in AAVA 1.0 may indicate incomplete migration or missing tool binding configuration.",8,11
deductions,risk,"ID value changes: Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 and introduction of agent IDs suggests these may be environment-specific rather than schema-intrinsic values.",2,3
deductions,ambiguity,"Model version implications: Upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 in modelDeploymentName may have functional implications not captured in metadata structure alone.",7,9
deductions,general_finding,"Content preservation: All task descriptions expectedOutput specifications and instructional content remain identical between versions indicating successful semantic preservation during structural evolution.",10,10
