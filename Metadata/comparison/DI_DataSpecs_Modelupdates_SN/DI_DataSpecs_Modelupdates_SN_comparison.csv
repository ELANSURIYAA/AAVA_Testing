deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution but concerning metadata degradation. AAVA 2.0 introduces modern schema patterns but loses critical specification details.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved - both represent DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical agent functionality and business purpose.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain semantically identical across versions maintaining functional consistency.",12,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Workflow name evolution from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN represents minor formatting change without semantic impact.",3,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root object restructured from flat workflowId/workflowName to nested workFlowDetail.id/name pattern representing modern schema design.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Array naming evolved from nodes to workflowAgents providing more descriptive semantics.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent structure flattened - task.description promoted to top-level description removing nested complexity.",12,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model reference evolved from model to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",13,9
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (1594) restructured to workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic preservation with structural modernization.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name with addition of agentId for enhanced identification.",12,7
deductions,field_change,"tools array replaced with toolReferences maintaining structural pattern but losing content.",14,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput specifications completely removed from AAVA 2.0 causing significant metadata loss for all 3 agents.",25,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tool references emptied in AAVA 2.0 - DI_Github_File_Writer_Z reference lost from first agent.",14,11
deductions,type_change,"Model deployment reference upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicating platform evolution.",13,9
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata reduces specification completeness and governance quality.",25,
deductions,governance_issue,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or data loss during transformation.",14,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates strong JSON validity with consistent structure and complete metadata coverage.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All agent definitions include complete task specifications with both description and expectedOutput.",12,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Tool references properly populated where applicable maintaining referential integrity.",14,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON structure but suffers from incomplete metadata migration.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Missing expectedOutput specifications across all agents reduces metadata completeness.",8,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest data loss or incomplete transformation process.",11,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents modernization from legacy flat structure to hierarchical workFlowDetail pattern.",2,2
deductions,schema_evolution,"Agent identification enhanced with numeric agentId addition improving referential capabilities.",12,7
deductions,schema_evolution,"Model deployment naming convention updated to reflect versioned deployment strategy.",13,9
deductions,risk,"Missing expectedOutput specifications may break downstream systems expecting complete task definitions.",25,
deductions,risk,"Empty tool references could impact workflow execution if tools are required for agent functionality.",14,11
deductions,risk,"Structural changes require careful migration planning to maintain system compatibility.",1,1
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences represent intentional removal or incomplete migration.",14,11
deductions,ambiguity,"Missing expectedOutput could indicate architectural change or data loss during transformation.",25,
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents architectural modernization with concerning metadata degradation requiring remediation.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Semantic consistency maintained at business logic level despite structural evolution.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Governance quality reduced due to missing specifications impacting downstream validation capabilities.",1,1
