deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major reorganization includes workflow structure changes and agent configuration modernization. Moderate compatibility risks identified due to structural changes.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality semantically preserved between versions. All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical business logic and objectives.",1,1
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workflow structure with workFlowDetail container and workflowAgents array, replacing flat nodes array structure from AAVA 1.0.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' with value change from 1594 to 2147",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' with formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'",3,4
deductions,structural_change,"'nodes' array (line 4) replaced with 'workflowAgents' array introducing nested structure with additional metadata fields",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' within workflowAgents structure",6,9
deductions,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' added in AAVA 2.0 (line 8) providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0",0,8
deductions,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'",7,10
deductions,field_change,"'tools' array field (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array, changing from tool names to empty arrays",8,95
deductions,structural_change,"'task' object structure (line 9) replaced with flat 'description' field, removing nested task.description and task.expectedOutput hierarchy",9,11
deductions,content_loss,"'expectedOutput' specifications removed from all agents in AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata completeness for output format requirements",0,0
deductions,type_change,"Tool references changed from string arrays containing tool names to empty arrays, indicating architectural shift in tool management",8,95
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of detailed output format specifications and expected output criteria reduces metadata governance quality in AAVA 2.0",0,0
deductions,compatibility_risk,"Structural reorganization from flat nodes to hierarchical workflowAgents may break existing parsers and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format",4,6
deductions,naming_convention,"Inconsistent camelCase usage: 'workFlowDetail' uses mixed case while other fields maintain consistent camelCase",0,2
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates excellent JSON validity with consistent structure, proper nesting, and complete metadata coverage",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 has valid JSON syntax but shows minor inconsistency in naming conventions and reduced metadata completeness",0,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents modernization with unique IDs and model versioning but sacrifices some metadata richness for structural simplicity",0,0
deductions,risk_assessment,"Medium risk for backward compatibility due to structural changes requiring migration scripts for dependent systems",0,0
