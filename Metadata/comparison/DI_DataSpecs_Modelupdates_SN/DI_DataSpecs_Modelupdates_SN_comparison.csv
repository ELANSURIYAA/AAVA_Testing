deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and normalization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow metadata reorganization and agent definition improvements.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical functional purposes.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent semantic alignment: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical business purposes and core functionality descriptions.",6,7
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions show 100% content preservation across versions with identical business logic and requirements.",15,25
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0's hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' + 'workflowAgents' structure.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow metadata enhancement: AAVA 2.0 introduces dedicated workFlowDetail object with explicit id (2147) and name fields for better governance.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent definition normalization: AAVA 2.0 replaces 'agentName' with structured 'agentId' + 'name' approach for better referential integrity.",6,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools reference evolution: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array in AAVA 2.0 for improved tool management.",10,30
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier change: 'workflowId' (1594) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (2147) with value update indicating version progression.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name normalization: 'workflowName' field moved to 'workFlowDetail.name' with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification enhancement: 'agentName' replaced with 'agentId' + 'name' structure providing unique numeric identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545).",6,7
deductions,field_change,"Model specification evolution: 'model' field replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' showing version progression (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",8,9
deductions,type_change,"Agent array restructuring: Root-level 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure.",5,6
deductions,type_change,"Tools reference modernization: Simple 'tools' string array evolved to 'toolReferences' empty array structure for future extensibility.",10,30
deductions,constraint_change,"Task structure flattening: AAVA 1.0 nested 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' flattened to direct 'description' field in AAVA 2.0.",15,25
deductions,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed: AAVA 2.0 eliminates detailed 'expectedOutput' metadata present in AAVA 1.0, reducing documentation completeness.",25,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tool definitions absent: AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' arrays where AAVA 1.0 specified 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool.",10,30
