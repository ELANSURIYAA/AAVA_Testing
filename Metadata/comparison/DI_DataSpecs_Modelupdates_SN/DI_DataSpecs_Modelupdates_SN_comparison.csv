deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more normalized schema with enhanced agent identification but removes critical task specification details. The semantic meaning is largely preserved despite structural reorganization.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' preserved across versions with consistent agent purposes and functionality descriptions.",3,4
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced object hierarchy and agent identification schema.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) replaced with nested 'workFlowDetail.id' structure (line 3). Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) replaced with nested 'workFlowDetail.name' structure (line 4). Name formatting changed from snake_case to title case.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) with enhanced agent metadata structure.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) for consistency.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' array (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 11) but all references are empty arrays.",8,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"Critical 'task' object structure completely removed from AAVA 2.0 agents, eliminating expectedOutput specifications and detailed task descriptions.",9,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Agent task descriptions moved from nested 'task.description' to direct 'description' field, but 'expectedOutput' specifications completely lost.",10,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata reduces workflow governance and validation capabilities in AAVA 2.0.",10,
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID data type preserved (numeric) but value changed from 1594 to 2147 indicating different workflow instances.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Addition of 'agentId' field (line 7) introduces new unique identifier constraint for agents in AAVA 2.0.",7,7
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with normalized workflow metadata structure and enhanced agent identification.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Tool reference arrays are empty in AAVA 2.0, potentially breaking tool integration functionality that existed in AAVA 1.0.",8,11
deductions,risk,"Removal of task.expectedOutput specifications may impact downstream validation and quality assurance processes.",9,
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences arrays indicate missing data migration or intentional removal of tool dependencies.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and complete metadata specifications.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced normalization but missing critical task output specifications.",1,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain the same three core agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases with preserved functional descriptions.",4,6
deductions,general_finding,"Model evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents indicates platform upgrade in AAVA 2.0.",7,9
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow represents a data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model updates, and test case generation.",1,1
