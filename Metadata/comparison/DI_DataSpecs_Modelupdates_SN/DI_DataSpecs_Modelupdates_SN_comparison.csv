deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate schema evolution. While semantic meaning is largely preserved, the structural changes introduce compatibility risks for downstream systems.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical functional purposes and agent responsibilities.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically equivalent: Technical Specification generation, Delta Model Changes computation, and Functional Test Cases creation.",4,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure (workflowId, workflowName, nodes) while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested hierarchy (workFlowDetail containing id/name, workflowAgents array).",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Array element structure completely redesigned: nodes array becomes workflowAgents with different internal schema and field organization.",4,8
deduction,field_change,"Root-level field workflowId (line 2) renamed to id nested under workFlowDetail (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root-level field workflowName (line 3) renamed to name nested under workFlowDetail (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved but path changed.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 8). Semantic meaning preserved.",4,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 10). Semantic meaning preserved.",6,10
deduction,field_change,"Agent field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 11). Enhanced semantic clarity.",7,11
deduction,field_change,"Agent field tools (line 8) renamed to toolReferences (line 12). Enhanced semantic clarity but structural change from string array to empty array.",8,12
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents. Represents platform evolution.",7,11
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools structure changed from populated string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to empty array []. Potential functionality regression.",8,12
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent task descriptions remain identical preserving functional requirements and business logic across versions.",9,13
deduction,governance_issue,"Missing agent IDs in AAVA 1.0 while AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) improving traceability.",6,9
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution represents major version change due to structural reorganization requiring migration scripts for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in JSON path structure (workflowId → workFlowDetail.id) will impact API consumers and data pipelines expecting flat structure.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool configuration regression (populated tools array → empty toolReferences) may break agent execution capabilities.",8,12
deduction,risk,"Nested structure increases parsing complexity and may affect performance of systems processing large metadata volumes.",1,2
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no orphaned references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no orphaned references.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical workflow semantics and agent functional specifications ensuring business continuity.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Structural changes improve metadata organization and traceability but introduce backward compatibility challenges.",1,1
