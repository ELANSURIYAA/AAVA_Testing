deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced hierarchy and modernized field naming while preserving core semantic meaning. Major changes include structural reorganization from flat to nested format and model version upgrades.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains identical purpose and agent functionality across versions.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent semantic alignment: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical business logic and responsibilities.",5,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root structure reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array in v1 becomes 'workflowAgents' array in v2, improving semantic clarity.",5,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent property evolution: 'agentName' becomes 'name', 'model' becomes 'modelDeploymentName', tools array becomes toolReferences array.",6,9
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID field: workflowId (1594) in v1 becomes workFlowDetail.id (2147) in v2, indicating new workflow instance.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name normalization: workflowName 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' becomes workFlowDetail.name 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' with space formatting.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification: agentName becomes name with slight formatting changes (underscores to spaces).",6,10
deductions,field_change,"Model reference evolution: 'model': 'gpt-4' becomes 'modelDeploymentName': 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade.",7,11
deductions,type_change,"Tools structure change: 'tools' string array becomes 'toolReferences' empty array, indicating architectural shift in tool management.",8,33
deductions,constraint_change,"Agent ID introduction: AAVA 2.0 adds agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) for unique agent identification.",6,9
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tool references empty: All agents in AAVA 2.0 have empty toolReferences arrays, losing tool association metadata from v1.",8,33
deductions,governance_issue,"Description field inconsistency: Task descriptions identical but agent-level descriptions missing in v1, present in v2.",9,12
deductions,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical enhancement: AAVA 2.0 introduces better data organization with nested objects improving maintainability.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Naming convention modernization: Field names in v2 follow camelCase more consistently (workFlowDetail, modelDeploymentName).",2,2
deductions,risk,"Tool reference loss: Empty toolReferences in v2 may break tool integration workflows that depend on v1 tool associations.",8,33
deductions,risk,"ID mismatch: Different workflow IDs (1594 vs 2147) indicate separate instances, potential lineage tracking issues.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Model version upgrade: gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral changes affecting downstream processing.",7,11
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON structure valid: Proper JSON syntax, consistent field types, no broken references.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency maintained: All agent references properly structured with consistent property naming.",5,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON structure valid: Proper JSON syntax with enhanced nested object organization.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural change.",33,
deductions,general_finding,"Content preservation: All task descriptions, instructions, and business logic preserved identically between versions.",9,12
deductions,general_finding,"Structural modernization: AAVA 2.0 represents clear architectural improvement with better organization and extensibility.",1,1
