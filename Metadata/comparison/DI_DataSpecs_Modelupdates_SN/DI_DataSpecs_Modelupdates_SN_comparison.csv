deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution of the AAVA 1.0 workflow definition while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN) and agent functionality but introduces a more sophisticated hierarchical organization. Key changes include workflow ID evolution (1594→2147), structural reorganization from flat nodes array to nested workflowAgents with enhanced metadata, and model version updates. The evolution demonstrates good governance practices while introducing some complexity that may impact downstream systems.",
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved across versions. Same three agents with identical business purposes: DI Data Technical Specification SN, DI Delta Model Changes SN, and DI Functional Test Cases SN. Agent descriptions maintain semantic consistency with minor textual variations.",
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow name consistency maintained: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' (v1) vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (v2) - underscore vs space difference represents presentation change only.",
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization from AAVA 1.0 flat 'nodes' array to AAVA 2.0 nested 'workflowAgents' hierarchy. This represents architectural evolution toward more sophisticated metadata management.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Introduction of workFlowDetail container in v2 provides better workflow metadata encapsulation with explicit id and name separation.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata enhancement: v1 uses simple 'agentName' while v2 introduces 'agentId', 'name', and 'modelDeploymentName' providing richer identification.",4,8
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier evolution: workflowId 1594 (v1) → id 2147 (v2) indicates version progression or environment difference.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming convention change: 'agentName' (v1) → 'name' (v2) with consistent semantic mapping across all three agents.",4,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification evolution: 'model': 'gpt-4' (v1) → 'modelDeploymentName': 'gpt-4.1' (v2) indicating model version advancement.",5,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools reference restructuring: 'tools' array (v1) → 'toolReferences' array (v2) with semantic preservation but structural change.",6,81
deduction,constraint_change,"Task structure maintained but relocated: 'task' object preserved in both versions with identical description and expectedOutput content.",7,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 1.0 includes explicit 'tools' array with 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' reference, while AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' arrays, potentially indicating tool configuration externalization.",6,81
deduction,governance_issue,"Cost estimation sections present in both versions but with formatting inconsistencies and incomplete token calculation specifications.",
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from simple node-based to agent-centric schema represents maturation of metadata model with improved traceability and governance capabilities.",
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 flat structure. Migration scripts may be required for dependent analytics pipelines.",
deduction,risk,"Tool reference changes could affect workflow execution if toolReferences array emptiness indicates missing tool configurations.",
deduction,ambiguity,"Relationship between workflowId (1594) and id (2147) unclear - could represent versioning, environment difference, or data migration artifact.",
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid. All references internally consistent. No orphaned objects or broken relationships detected.",
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid. Nested structure properly formed. Agent IDs and references maintain internal consistency.",
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical business logic and functional requirements within agent descriptions, ensuring continuity of workflow capabilities.",
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output formats remain consistent across versions, preserving downstream compatibility for generated artifacts."
