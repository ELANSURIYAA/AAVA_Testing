deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate schema evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical improvements but removes some metadata completeness.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow semantics preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains same three-agent pipeline (Technical Specification -> Delta Model Changes -> Functional Test Cases) with identical business logic and processing flow.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array vs AAVA 2.0's nested 'workFlowDetail' + 'workflowAgents' hierarchy. This represents architectural evolution toward better separation of concerns.",3,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier: 'workflowId' (1594) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (2147). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,4
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name: 'workflowName' moved from root to 'workFlowDetail.name' with minor formatting change ('DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN').",3,5
deduction,field_change,"Agent container: 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' array. Semantic meaning identical but improved naming convention.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming: 'agentName' renamed to 'name' within agent objects. Simplified but semantically equivalent.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model reference: 'model' field renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade ('gpt-4' -> 'gpt-4.1'). Enhanced specificity and versioning.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool references: 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array. AAVA 2.0 shows empty arrays vs AAVA 1.0's populated tool references.",8,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure removal: AAVA 2.0 removes nested 'task' objects containing 'description' and 'expectedOutput'. This represents significant metadata loss affecting governance and traceability.",9,
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification: AAVA 2.0 introduces explicit 'agentId' fields (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identifiers absent in AAVA 1.0.",6,9
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degradation: AAVA 2.0 loses detailed task specifications, expected outputs, and cost estimation sections present in AAVA 1.0, reducing operational transparency.",15,
deduction,type_change,"ID evolution: Workflow ID changed from integer 1594 to 2147, and agent-level IDs introduced. Suggests system evolution and enhanced entity management.",2,4
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool integration: AAVA 1.0 explicitly references 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool, while AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' arrays, potentially indicating tool abstraction or configuration externalization.",8,11
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with consistent typing, proper nesting, and no orphaned references. All string fields properly quoted and arrays well-formed.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with consistent typing and proper nesting. Minor inconsistency in 'workFlowDetail' camelCase vs 'workflowAgents' lowercase 'w'.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version evolution assessment: AAVA 2.0 represents a major structural refactoring (v1->v2) with improved hierarchy but reduced metadata richness. Migration complexity: Medium due to structural changes.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes in workflow and agent object models may break existing parsers, ETL processes, and governance tools expecting AAVA 1.0 schema.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Metadata governance risk: Loss of task-level metadata in AAVA 2.0 reduces audit trail, cost tracking, and operational visibility compared to AAVA 1.0's comprehensive task specifications.",15,
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference ambiguity: AAVA 2.0's empty 'toolReferences' arrays create uncertainty about actual tool dependencies and integration patterns.",8,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent semantic preservation: All three agents (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN) maintain identical core descriptions and functional purposes across versions.",6,9
deduction,general_finding,"Model versioning: Consistent upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents suggests coordinated platform evolution and improved model capabilities.",7,10
