deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution of the AAVA 1.0 workflow definition while preserving core semantic meaning. The transformation introduces hierarchical organization and enhanced metadata structure but creates moderate compatibility challenges.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN is preserved with identical business purpose across both versions. All three agent functionalities (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain semantic equivalence.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain functionally identical between versions, preserving business logic and operational requirements. No semantic drift detected in core functionality definitions.",8,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization from flat JSON structure (v1) to hierarchical workFlowDetail + workflowAgents structure (v2). This represents architectural evolution rather than semantic change.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification migrated from simple workflowId/workflowName (lines 2-3 in v1) to nested workFlowDetail object with id/name properties (lines 2-5 in v2).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent definitions restructured from nodes array with embedded properties to workflowAgents array with dedicated agentId, name, modelDeploymentName, and description fields.",5,6
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4). Maintains workflow identification semantics.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Preserves agent collection concept with enhanced naming clarity.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8) within agent context. Simplified naming convention.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9). Enhanced specificity for deployment context.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer 1594 (line 2) to integer 2147 (line 3). Data type preserved, value updated for versioning.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure modified from inline tools array (line 8) to toolReferences array (line 11). Empty arrays in both cases but structural contract changed.",8,11
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task object structure preserved but moved from embedded task property to description field, losing nested expectedOutput structure in v2.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of structured task.expectedOutput metadata in v2 reduces governance traceability for agent output specifications.",9,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from AAVA 1.0 flat structure to AAVA 2.0 hierarchical structure represents major version schema migration requiring adapter patterns.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes require migration scripts for dependent systems expecting v1 JSON structure. Field path changes break existing JSON parsers.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput structure in v2 may impact downstream validation and governance systems expecting detailed output specifications.",45,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Model version evolution from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform upgrade but may affect processing behavior and compatibility.",7,9
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with consistent internal structure and complete metadata definitions.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 maintains JSON syntax validity with enhanced hierarchical organization, though some metadata detail is reduced.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve core workflow processing logic despite structural reorganization.",5,6
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain character-for-character identical, ensuring functional equivalence across versions.",15,15
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow naming convention evolved from snake_case (workflowName) to mixed case (workFlowDetail) indicating style guide changes.",3,2
