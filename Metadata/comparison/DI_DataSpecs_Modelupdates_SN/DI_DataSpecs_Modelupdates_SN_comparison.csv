deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization patterns but removes critical task specification details, creating governance and compatibility concerns.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model changes, and functional testing.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same business functions.",5,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object with separate 'workflowAgents' array.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed: workflowId (1594) + workflowName pattern replaced by workFlowDetail.id (2147) + workFlowDetail.name structure.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array in v1 becomes 'workflowAgents' array in v2, preserving array structure but changing semantic meaning.",4,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier evolution: 'agentName' (v1) becomes 'name' (v2), losing semantic specificity in field naming.",6,9
deductions,field_change,"Model reference updated: 'model' field (v1) becomes 'modelDeploymentName' (v2), adding deployment context but changing field semantics.",7,10
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID type consistency maintained: both versions use integer IDs (1594 vs 2147) with different values but same data type.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Critical task specification removal: AAVA 2.0 eliminates entire 'task' object containing description and expectedOutput, removing 80% of functional metadata.",8,11
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degraded: AAVA 2.0 removes detailed task descriptions, expected outputs, and formatting requirements present in v1.",8,11
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool reference structure simplified: v1 'tools' array with actual tool names replaced by empty 'toolReferences' arrays in v2, losing tool mapping information.",7,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Version progression detected: model upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform evolution and potential capability enhancement.",7,10
deductions,schema_evolution,"Agent identification enhanced: v2 introduces 'agentId' field (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identifiers absent in v1.",6,9
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper nesting, consistent data types, and complete object definitions.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency check: All agent references, tool mappings, and workflow relationships are logically consistent and complete.",4,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper nesting and consistent data types.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Structural inconsistency detected: Empty 'toolReferences' arrays suggest incomplete migration or missing tool mapping data.",11,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Metadata completeness issue: Missing 'task' specifications reduce functional completeness compared to expected workflow metadata standards.",8,
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes in workflow and agent organization may break existing dependent systems expecting v1 schema.",1,2
deductions,risk,"Functional regression risk: Removal of task specifications eliminates critical execution guidance for downstream automation systems.",8,11
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate broken tool mappings affecting agent execution capabilities.",7,11
deductions,ambiguity,"Naming convention inconsistency: Mixed use of camelCase (workFlowDetail) and PascalCase (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN) creates style ambiguity.",2,9
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow evolution pattern: AAVA 2.0 demonstrates enterprise-grade metadata organization with enhanced structure but reduced functional detail.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Agent count preservation: Both versions maintain exactly 3 agents in the workflow, preserving core processing pipeline structure.",4,7
