deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and agent metadata enhancement.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same conceptual workflow for DI DataSpecs Modelupdates with three core agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. Core business logic and agent purposes remain semantically aligned.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces major structural changes: workflowId/workflowName replaced with nested workFlowDetail object, nodes array replaced with workflowAgents array, and enhanced agent metadata structure.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value also changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscores removed).",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). This represents a semantic improvement in naming clarity.",4,6
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' added to each agent object in AAVA 2.0 (lines 7, 47, 87). This enhances agent identification and traceability.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (lines 6, 46, 86) renamed to 'name' (lines 8, 48, 88). Semantic meaning preserved with simplified naming.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (lines 7, 47, 87) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (lines 9, 49, 89). Values also evolved from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version upgrade.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field 'tools' array (lines 8, 48, 88) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (lines 135, 136, 137). First agent shows empty array instead of 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool reference.",8,135
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure completely reorganized. 'task.description' and 'task.expectedOutput' (lines 9-10) replaced with single 'description' field (line 10). Expected output content merged into description.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references removed from agents in AAVA 2.0. First agent loses 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool reference, potentially impacting functionality.",8,135
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer 1594 to 2147, indicating this represents a different workflow instance or version.",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure. All nested objects properly formed and no broken references detected.",0,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution (v1 to v2) with breaking changes in field names and structure. Migration would require field mapping and structural transformation.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in field names and structure may impact downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format. Tool reference removal may affect agent functionality.",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether tool reference removal in AAVA 2.0 is intentional deprecation or data loss. May require validation against system requirements.",8,135
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions and core functionality specifications, ensuring business logic preservation despite structural changes.",9,10
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 shows improved metadata organization with explicit agent IDs and clearer field naming conventions, enhancing system maintainability.",1,1
