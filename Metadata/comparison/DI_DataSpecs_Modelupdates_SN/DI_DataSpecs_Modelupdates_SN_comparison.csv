deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and additional metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow organization restructuring and agent metadata enhancement.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical business purpose and agent functionality. Core semantic meaning is preserved across all three agents.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization with nested workFlowDetail object and enhanced workflowAgents array structure with additional metadata fields.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with formatting change from underscore to space separation",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Root array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) maintaining same semantic purpose",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent objects restructured from simple properties to enhanced metadata structure with agentId, modelDeploymentName, and toolReferences fields",5,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 9) preserving semantic meaning",6,9
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'",7,10
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' (line 8) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 82) and moved to end of agent object",8,82
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task object structure completely reorganized from nested task.description and task.expectedOutput to flat description field with expectedOutput removed",9,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"ExpectedOutput field removed from all agents in AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata completeness for output specifications",15,
deductions,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput specifications may impact downstream system integration and validation processes",15,
deductions,type_change,"Tools array structure changed from string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to empty array [] for all agents",8,82
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no broken references",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and no broken references",1,
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with structural reorganization and metadata enhancement while preserving core workflow semantics",1,1
deductions,risk,"Structural changes may require significant updates to dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format",1,1
deductions,risk,"Removal of expectedOutput fields reduces specification completeness and may impact automated validation",15,
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 suggest incomplete migration or different tool reference strategy",8,82
deductions,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain identical between versions indicating preserved functional specifications",11,11
deductions,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform modernization",7,10
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 suggests this represents a different workflow instance or version",2,3
