deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include nested object hierarchies and field renaming that may impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions represent data integration workflows with technical specification agents. Business meaning remains consistent despite structural changes.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure. This represents a 35-point structural deviation from the original flat schema.",1,2
deductions,field_change,"workflowId field (1594) migrated to workFlowDetail.id (2147) with value change indicating different workflow instance.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with formatting changes: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deductions,structural_change,"Root-level nodes array replaced with workflowAgents array under new hierarchy. Array semantics preserved but location changed.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent agentName field renamed to name across all agent objects. Semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deductions,field_addition,"New agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) added in AAVA 2.0 providing unique agent identification not present in v1.",0,7
deductions,field_change,"model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model evolution.",7,9
deductions,structural_change,"tools array replaced with toolReferences array. AAVA 1.0 had populated tools, AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays.",8,10
deductions,structural_change,"task object structure flattened in AAVA 2.0. expectedOutput content moved to description field, task.description content preserved.",9,10
deductions,data_loss_risk,"Tool references lost in migration: AAVA 1.0 had 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool, AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences.",8,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Task structure simplification may impact downstream systems expecting nested task.description and task.expectedOutput fields.",9,10
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",1,0
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",0,1
deductions,compatibility_risk,"Field renaming without aliases may break existing integrations expecting original field names (workflowId, agentName, model, tools).",0,0
deductions,version_evolution,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 suggests this represents a different workflow instance rather than pure schema evolution.",2,3
deductions,model_upgrade,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution with potential capability improvements.",7,9
deductions,schema_normalization,"AAVA 2.0 shows improved normalization with workFlowDetail object grouping related workflow metadata.",1,2
deductions,metadata_enhancement,"Addition of agentId provides better agent tracking and referential integrity in AAVA 2.0.",0,7
deductions,structural_consistency,"Both versions maintain consistent agent array structure with preserved agent descriptions and core functionality definitions.",4,6
deductions,business_continuity,"Core business logic and agent capabilities remain functionally equivalent between versions despite structural changes.",0,0
deductions,migration_complexity,"Structural changes require mapping logic for field renames and hierarchy restructuring during version migration.",0,0
deductions,data_governance,"Loss of tool references in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or intentional architectural change requiring validation.",8,10
