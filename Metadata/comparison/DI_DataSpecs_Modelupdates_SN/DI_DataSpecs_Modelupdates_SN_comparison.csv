deduction,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and additional metadata fields while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow detail reorganization and agent metadata enhancement.",1,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical core functionality. The three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain consistent semantic purpose across versions.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization: workflow metadata moved from flat structure to nested workFlowDetail object, agents array renamed to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata structure.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value formatting changed from underscore to space-separated format.",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Agents array restructured from 'nodes' (line 4) to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) with enhanced metadata including agentId and explicit tool references.",4,6
deduction,field_addition,"AAVA 2.0 introduces new agentId field (lines 7,32,57) providing unique identifiers for each agent, enhancing traceability.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent name field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) with slight formatting changes in values.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Model field changed from 'model' with value 'gpt-4' (line 7) to 'modelDeploymentName' with value 'gpt-4.1' (line 9), indicating version upgrade.",7,9
deduction,structural_change,"Tools array restructured from simple string array 'tools' (line 8) to empty 'toolReferences' array (line 71), suggesting architectural change in tool management.",8,71
deduction,field_change,"Task structure remains semantically identical but shows minor formatting differences in description content across all three agents.",11,10
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 shows valid JSON syntax with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed and agent definitions are complete.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON syntax with enhanced structure. New fields are properly integrated and maintain referential consistency.",0,1
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool management approach changed significantly - AAVA 1.0 uses populated tools array while AAVA 2.0 uses empty toolReferences, potentially impacting tool discovery.",8,71
deduction,schema_evolution,"The evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a minor version upgrade with structural enhancements while maintaining backward semantic compatibility.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Structural changes in workflow metadata access patterns may require updates to dependent systems expecting flat structure.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool reference architecture change may impact agent execution if toolReferences array is not properly populated at runtime.",8,71
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical core task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional consistency across the evolution.",11,10
deduction,general_finding,"Agent sequence and dependencies remain unchanged, preserving workflow execution logic.",4,6
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create uncertainty about actual tool availability and configuration.",71,71
