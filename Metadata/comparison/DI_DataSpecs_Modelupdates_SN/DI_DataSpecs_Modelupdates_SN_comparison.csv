deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same three agents with identical functional descriptions but introduces enhanced organizational structure and model versioning. Key changes include structural reorganization from flat to nested hierarchy and model upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents preserve identical functional descriptions and task definitions. Agent purposes remain unchanged: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN for technical specs, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN for model evolution, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN for test case generation.",3,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural changes: workflowId/workflowName (lines 2-3) replaced by nested workFlowDetail object (lines 2-5), nodes array renamed to workflowAgents, and agent structure enhanced with agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) replaced by 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) replaced by 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access path changed.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved with improved naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' replaced by 'name' with addition of 'agentId' field. Enhanced identification capability.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification changed from 'model: gpt-4' to 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1'. Represents both structural and version evolution.",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools handling modified: AAVA 1.0 uses 'tools' array with string references (line 8), AAVA 2.0 uses 'toolReferences' as empty arrays (line 11). Potential functionality impact.",8,11
deduction,constraint_change,"Task structure preserved but nested differently. AAVA 1.0 has task.description and task.expectedOutput, AAVA 2.0 has flat description field. Expected output handling unclear in v2.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes explicit expectedOutput specifications present in AAVA 1.0, potentially reducing metadata completeness for downstream systems.",,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat to nested structure represents major version evolution. Backward compatibility requires mapping layer for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 structure.",,
deduction,risk,"Tool reference mechanism change from populated arrays to empty arrays may indicate incomplete migration or functional regression.",,
deduction,risk,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may impact existing integrations expecting specific model behavior.",,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with consistent structure across all agents. No broken references or type inconsistencies detected.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax validity with enhanced structure. All nested objects properly formed with no syntax errors.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent count (3) and preserve core functional descriptions, indicating controlled evolution rather than complete redesign.",,
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow ID changed from 1594 to 2147, suggesting this represents a different workflow instance or significant version increment.",,
