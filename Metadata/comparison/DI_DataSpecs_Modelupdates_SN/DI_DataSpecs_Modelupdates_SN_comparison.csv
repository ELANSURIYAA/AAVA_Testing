deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more sophisticated hierarchical organization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow metadata reorganization and agent definition enhancement.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification generation, model delta computation, and functional test case creation.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains same core functionality across both versions with identical task descriptions.",8,15
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN preserves complete semantic meaning with identical descriptions for model evolution and DDL generation capabilities.",49,35
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintains identical test case generation functionality and requirements across both versions.",85,55
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",3,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with workFlowDetail.id/name nested structure (v2).",2,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent definition structure significantly enhanced: simple agentName (v1) expanded to comprehensive agentId/name/modelDeploymentName structure (v2).",8,15
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tool reference mechanism changed: tools array with string values (v1) replaced with toolReferences array structure (v2).",12,74
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model specification evolution: simple 'model' field (v1) enhanced to 'modelDeploymentName' with version specificity (v2).",9,17
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID field renamed: 'workflowId' (line 2) to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name field restructured: 'workflowName' (line 3) to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: 'agentName' (line 8) replaced with separate 'agentId' (line 15) and 'name' (line 16) fields.",8,15
deductions,field_change,"Model specification upgraded: 'model' field (line 9) evolved to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 17) with version increment from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",9,17
deductions,field_change,"Tool reference structure modified: 'tools' array (line 10) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 74) with different organizational approach.",10,74
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID type consistency maintained: integer type preserved across both versions despite structural reorganization.",2,3
deductions,type_change,"Agent identification type evolution: string agentName (v1) expanded to integer agentId plus string name (v2).",8,15
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool constraint relaxation: AAVA 1.0 requires tools array with string values, AAVA 2.0 allows empty toolReferences arrays.",10,74
deductions,missing_metadata,"Task structure preserved: Both versions maintain identical task.description and task.expectedOutput content with no metadata loss.",13,18
deductions,governance_issue,"Field naming inconsistency: 'workFlowDetail' uses mixed case while other fields follow camelCase convention in AAVA 2.0.",3,3
deductions,governance_issue,"Agent naming inconsistency: Agent names contain spaces and mixed formatting across both versions affecting standardization.",8,16
deductions,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution represents major version change: structural hierarchy introduction suggests breaking changes for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility risk: Field path changes (workflowId to workFlowDetail.id) require mapping logic for existing integrations.",2,3
deductions,schema_evolution,"Enhanced metadata richness: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId for better referential integrity and modelDeploymentName for version tracking.",15,17
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax validation: Well-formed JSON with proper nesting, brackets, and comma placement.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 internal consistency: All agent references properly defined with consistent field types and no orphaned references.",8,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 constraint compliance: Required fields present, array structures properly formatted, string values properly quoted.",10,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax validation: Well-formed JSON with proper hierarchical nesting and structural organization.",1,

deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 minor inconsistency: Mixed case 'workFlowDetail' deviates from camelCase convention used elsewhere.",3,
deductions,risk,"Integration impact: Dependent systems using workflowId path will require updates to access workFlowDetail.id.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Agent reference risk: Systems relying on agentName for identification need migration to agentId-based references.",8,15
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: Changes to tool reference structure may impact tool binding and execution frameworks.",10,74
deductions,risk,"Model version dependency: Upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral differences in agent execution.",9,17
