deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and naming conventions. Major structural changes include field reorganization and enhanced agent metadata modeling.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specifications data model changes and functional test cases. Business purpose and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Significant structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure representing improved metadata organization.",3,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value format change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured: 'nodes' array (line 4) replaced with 'workflowAgents' array (line 6) indicating improved semantic naming.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) within enhanced agent object structure.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"New field 'agentId' (line 7) introduced in AAVA 2.0 providing unique agent identification not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value change from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version evolution.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field 'tools' array (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 11) showing structural enhancement from tool names to tool reference system.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened: 'task.description' (line 10) moved to direct 'description' field (line 10) eliminating nested task wrapper.",10,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"Field 'task.expectedOutput' present in AAVA 1.0 (multiple lines) completely removed in AAVA 2.0 representing potential metadata loss.",0,0
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references changed from string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to empty array [] indicating tool configuration changes.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expected output specifications in AAVA 2.0 may impact downstream systems expecting detailed output format definitions.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field types proper nesting and no broken references. All agent definitions are complete and well-formed.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure consistent field types and no broken references. Agent definitions are complete with improved organization.",0,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents moderate schema migration with improved organization but potential breaking changes for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 structure.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may require updates to dependent systems parsing workflow metadata. Field path changes could break existing integrations.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata may impact validation and quality assurance processes expecting detailed output specifications.",0,0
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain identical preserving functional specifications and business logic requirements across both versions.",10,10
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow maintains three-agent pattern: Technical Specification -> Delta Model Changes -> Functional Test Cases ensuring process continuity.",4,6
