deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been modernized with enhanced agent metadata and improved organizational structure. However, structural changes introduce moderate compatibility concerns.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains identical: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with three agents for technical specification, delta model changes, and functional test cases. Business logic and functional requirements are preserved.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure with enhanced metadata hierarchy.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural path changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value format changed from snake_case to title case.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' (line 4) to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). More descriptive naming but breaks backward compatibility.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8). Simplified naming convention.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9). More specific and descriptive naming.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' (line 8) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 10). Enhanced semantic clarity.",8,10
deduction,type_change,"Agent ID field added as 'agentId' (line 7) with integer value 3885. New metadata not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,7
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents. Indicates model evolution.",7,9
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed from string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to empty array []. Tool references removed or relocated.",8,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agent-specific IDs (3885, 3474, 3545) enabling better tracking and referencing. This enhances data governance but requires migration mapping.",0,7
deduction,governance_issue,"Task descriptions remain identical across versions indicating preserved functional requirements. No content drift detected in business logic.",11,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications preserved verbatim ensuring downstream system compatibility for content generation.",50,50
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 represents a minor version upgrade with structural improvements but no breaking semantic changes.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural path changes (workflowId -> workFlowDetail.id) may break existing API integrations and data access patterns.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool reference changes from populated array to empty array may indicate incomplete migration or architectural shift requiring validation.",8,10
deduction,risk,"Agent naming changes (agentName -> name) require comprehensive mapping for existing references and dependencies.",6,8
deduction,ambiguity,"Inconsistent casing in 'workFlowDetail' (camelCase with capital F) vs standard camelCase convention may indicate data entry inconsistency.",2,2
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs ensuring functional equivalence despite structural changes.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates improved metadata organization with dedicated workflow detail section and enhanced agent identification.",1,2
deduction,general_finding,"Model deployment naming in AAVA 2.0 provides better version tracking and deployment management capabilities.",7,9
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no broken references. All required fields present.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure. Minor casing inconsistency in 'workFlowDetail' but no functional impact.",1,0
deduction,general_finding,"Overall assessment: AAVA 2.0 represents a well-executed schema evolution with preserved semantics and improved structure, requiring careful migration planning.",1,1
