deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with moderate structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced schema organization while preserving core semantic meaning. Key changes include workflow metadata restructuring, agent configuration evolution, and model version updates. Overall compatibility is maintained with some breaking changes in structure.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model changes, and test case generation. Business logic and agent purposes remain semantically identical.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"Significant structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow metadata while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object, changing from workflowId/workflowName to id/name structure.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from 'workflowId' to 'workFlowDetail.id' with value change from 1594 to 2147. Semantic meaning preserved but structure modified.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name changed from 'workflowName' to 'workFlowDetail.name' with value evolution from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore to space).",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Container array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' indicating semantic refinement from generic nodes to specific agent entities.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming convention evolved: 'agentName' became 'name' with addition of 'agentId' field providing unique identifiers (3885, 3474, 3545).",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification evolved from 'model': 'gpt-4' to 'modelDeploymentName': 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",7,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool reference mechanism completely restructured: AAVA 1.0 uses 'tools' array with string references ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] while AAVA 2.0 uses empty 'toolReferences' arrays.",8,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool configuration degraded in AAVA 2.0: first agent loses tool reference to 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z', potentially breaking GitHub integration functionality.",8,10
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain semantically identical across versions, preserving business logic and functional requirements for all three agents.",9,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure simplified in AAVA 2.0: complex nested 'task' objects with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' flattened to single 'description' field.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications removed in AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata completeness and potentially impacting downstream validation processes.",50,10
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates high internal consistency with valid JSON structure, complete agent configurations, and proper tool references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 shows minor consistency issues: empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or intentional tool removal affecting functionality.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution follows major version pattern with breaking changes in structure but preserved semantic meaning. Migration would require field mapping and tool reference restoration.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in workflow metadata structure may impact dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format. Tool reference removal creates functional regression risk.",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 represents intentional removal or incomplete migration, requiring clarification for proper assessment.",1,10
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution but may introduce behavioral changes requiring validation.",7,9
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 suggests different workflow instances rather than direct version evolution, potentially indicating parallel development.",2,3
