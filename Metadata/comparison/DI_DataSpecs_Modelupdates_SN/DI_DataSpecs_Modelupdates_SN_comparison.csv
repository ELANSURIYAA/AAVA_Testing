deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and updated model references. Major structural changes include flattened workflow identification and reorganized agent definitions.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define data integration workflows with technical specification agents, delta model change agents, and functional test case agents. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes and descriptions maintain semantic alignment across versions with identical functional requirements for technical specifications, model changes, and test case generation.",6,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow properties (workflowId, workflowName) while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object with id and name properties.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' array to 'workflowAgents' array, representing architectural evolution in terminology.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent property structure significantly changed: AAVA 1.0 uses agentName/model/tools/task structure while AAVA 2.0 uses agentId/name/modelDeploymentName/description/toolReferences structure.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from workflowId (1594) to workFlowDetail.id (2147) with different values indicating version evolution.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name changed from workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with identical values preserving semantic meaning.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' maintaining array structure but changing semantic context.",5,7
deductions,field_change,"Agent identifier changed from agentName (string) to agentId (numeric) + name (string) providing both unique ID and readable name.",7,9
deductions,field_change,"Model reference evolved from 'model' (gpt-4) to 'modelDeploymentName' (gpt-4.1) indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",8,11
deductions,field_change,"Tool configuration changed from 'tools' array with string values to 'toolReferences' empty array, potentially indicating architectural shift.",9,17
deductions,field_change,"Task structure flattened from nested task.description/expectedOutput to single 'description' field, consolidating agent definition.",10,12
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from numeric primitive (workflowId: 1594) to nested object property (workFlowDetail.id: 2147).",2,3
deductions,type_change,"Agent identification changed from string-based (agentName) to numeric-based (agentId) with separate name field.",7,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references changed from populated array with specific tool names to empty array, potentially indicating tools are now referenced differently.",9,17
deductions,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes expectedOutput specifications that were present in AAVA 1.0 task definitions, reducing metadata completeness.",10,
deductions,missing_metadata,"Detailed task structure with separate description and expectedOutput collapsed into single description field, losing output format specifications.",10,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 without explicit migration documentation or compatibility notes.",8,11
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool reference mechanism changed without clear mapping between old tool names and new toolReferences structure.",9,17
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 introduces more normalized structure with separate workflow detail object and agent-specific IDs, indicating maturation of metadata model.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Agent definition evolution from task-centric (with separate description/expectedOutput) to description-centric model suggests simplified agent configuration approach.",10,12
deductions,risk,"Breaking changes in workflow and agent identification may impact dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 structure.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Tool reference mechanism change could break integrations that depend on specific tool name mappings.",9,17
deductions,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata may impact systems that rely on output format specifications for validation or processing.",10,
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear mapping between AAVA 1.0 tool names (DI_Github_File_Writer_Z) and AAVA 2.0 empty toolReferences arrays.",9,17
deductions,ambiguity,"Model deployment naming convention change from simple version (gpt-4) to deployment-specific naming (gpt-4.1) without clear versioning strategy.",8,11
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions and functional requirements, ensuring business logic preservation despite structural changes.",10,12
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents a more mature metadata model with better separation of concerns and normalized structure.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Workflow ID values differ (1594 vs 2147) suggesting these represent different workflow instances rather than pure version evolution.",2,3
