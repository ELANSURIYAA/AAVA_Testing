deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced hierarchy and naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. Major changes include structural reorganization, model version upgrades, and tool reference modifications.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN preserved across both versions with identical business purpose and agent functionality.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN renamed to DI Data Technical Specification SN with semantic meaning fully preserved.",7,9
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN renamed to DI Delta Model Changes SN maintaining identical functional purpose.",31,18
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN renamed to DI Functional Test Cases SN with preserved semantic intent.",55,27
deductions,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Nodes array renamed to workflowAgents with enhanced metadata structure including agentId field.",6,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model reference changed from simple 'model' field to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade.",8,11
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools array restructured to toolReferences with different data organization.",10,36
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task object flattened - expectedOutput section removed and integrated into description.",11,12
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (1594) replaced by workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic equivalence maintained.",2,3

deductions,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name across all agents.",7,10
deductions,type_change,"Model version upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Tools constraint changed from string array to empty toolReferences array structure.",10,36

deductions,schema_evolution,"Migration from flat to hierarchical structure represents major schema evolution.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Model version upgrade may impact downstream systems expecting gpt-4 specifically.",8,11
deductions,risk,"Removed expectedOutput sections may break systems relying on this metadata.",12,
deductions,risk,"Tool reference restructuring requires validation of dependent automation systems.",10,36
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays create ambiguity about intended tool configuration.",10,36
deductions,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 represents controlled evolution with improved structure but some metadata loss.",1,1
