deduction,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution of the metadata contract while preserving core semantic meaning. The reorganization introduces improved data modeling with explicit agent IDs and enhanced tool reference management but creates moderate backward compatibility challenges.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents maintain identical core task descriptions and business logic. The fundamental workflow purpose of creating technical specifications data model changes and functional test cases remains unchanged.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent names show minor variations: 'DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN' vs 'DI Data Technical Specification SN' (underscore vs space) but semantic meaning is preserved.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' fields while AAVA 2.0 nests these under 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Node structure completely redesigned: 'nodes' array in v1 becomes 'workflowAgents' array in v2 with different field organization.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool management restructured: v1 uses 'tools' array with string values while v2 uses 'toolReferences' array (currently empty).",9,75
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID field renamed: 'workflowId' (v1 line 2) to 'workFlowDetail.id' (v2 line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field renamed: 'workflowName' (v1 line 3) to 'workFlowDetail.name' (v2 line 4) with formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (v1 line 4) becomes 'workflowAgents' array (v2 line 6).",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent identifier field renamed: 'agentName' (v1 line 6) becomes 'name' (v2 line 9) with new 'agentId' field added (v2 line 8).",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model field renamed: 'model' (v1 line 7) becomes 'modelDeploymentName' (v2 line 10) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool reference structure changed: 'tools' array with values like 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' (v1 line 9) replaced with empty 'toolReferences' array (v2 line 75).",9,75
deduction,type_change,"Workflow identification changed from simple integer 'workflowId' to nested object structure 'workFlowDetail.id' affecting data access patterns.",2,2
deduction,constraint_change,"First agent in v1 has tools array with 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' while corresponding agent in v2 has empty toolReferences array indicating potential tool configuration loss.",9,75
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces 'agentId' fields (3885 3474 3545) providing unique identifiers missing in AAVA 1.0.",8,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference management degraded: v1 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' for first agent while v2 shows empty toolReferences arrays for all agents.",9,75
deduction,governance_issue,"Model versioning inconsistency: upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents may impact behavior and cost calculations.",7,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema evolution represents moderate breaking change requiring client code updates for field access patterns and tool reference handling.",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether empty 'toolReferences' arrays in v2 represent intentional removal or incomplete migration of tool configurations.",75,75
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: clients accessing 'workflowId' 'workflowName' and 'nodes' fields will break when migrating to AAVA 2.0.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Tool integration risk: missing tool references in v2 may break agent execution if tools are required for task completion.",9,75
deduction,risk,"Data access risk: nested structure changes require updates to all downstream systems accessing workflow metadata.",2,2
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain byte-for-byte identical across versions indicating strong preservation of functional requirements.",11,11
deduction,general_finding,"Expected output specifications are identical preserving contract requirements for downstream consumers.",50,50
deduction,general_finding,"Cost estimation sections remain unchanged ensuring consistent financial tracking capabilities.",85,85
