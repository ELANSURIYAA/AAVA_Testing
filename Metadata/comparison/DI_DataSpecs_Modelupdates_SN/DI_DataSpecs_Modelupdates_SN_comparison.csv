deduction,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced governance. AAVA 2.0 introduces improved naming conventions and enhanced agent metadata while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define identical workflow functionality for DI DataSpecs Modelupdates with three core agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. Business logic and agent purposes remain semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces major structural reorganization: workflowId/workflowName replaced with workFlowDetail object, nodes array renamed to workflowAgents, and enhanced agent metadata structure.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) replaced with 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) replaced with 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscores to spaces).",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Represents same conceptual collection but different naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' added to each agent in AAVA 2.0 (lines 7,27,47). Enhances agent identification and governance.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (lines 5,25,45) renamed to 'name' in AAVA 2.0. Semantic meaning preserved.",5,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (lines 6,26,46) replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' in AAVA 2.0. Values changed from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version upgrade.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' (lines 7,27,47) renamed to 'toolReferences' in AAVA 2.0. Structure changed from string array to empty array, indicating architectural shift.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'task' (lines 8,28,48) renamed to 'description' in AAVA 2.0. Content structure flattened from nested object to direct string.",8,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references removed in AAVA 2.0 - all toolReferences arrays are empty, potentially indicating incomplete migration or architectural change.",7,10
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (1594) to integer (2147), indicating different workflow instance or versioning.",2,3
deduction,naming_convention,"AAVA 2.0 adopts camelCase naming (workFlowDetail, workflowAgents, agentId, modelDeploymentName, toolReferences) vs AAVA 1.0 snake_case/simple names.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure. All references are properly formed and no orphaned objects detected.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has empty toolReferences arrays which may indicate incomplete data migration or architectural change.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may break downstream systems expecting tool definitions. Migration scripts may be needed.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Structural changes in workflow and agent field names require updates to all consuming applications and APIs.",0,0
deduction,compatibility_impact,"Field name changes (workflowId->workFlowDetail.id, agentName->name, model->modelDeploymentName) break backward compatibility.",0,0
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor-to-major version evolution with enhanced metadata governance but breaking structural changes.",0,0
