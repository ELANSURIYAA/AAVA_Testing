deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate schema evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced data modeling with explicit agent IDs and improved field organization while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical business purpose and three core agents for technical specification, model changes, and functional test cases.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions and task definitions remain semantically equivalent between versions, preserving business logic and functional requirements.",8,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array.",3,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed from simple 'workflowId' integer to structured object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) - semantic meaning preserved but structure enhanced.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) moved to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) - hierarchical organization improved.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) - more descriptive naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' within agent objects - simplified naming convention.",6,9
deduction,type_change,"Field 'model' (string) replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' (string) - enhanced specificity for model deployment tracking.",7,10
deduction,structural_change,"Agent structure flattened: 'task' object removed, 'description' moved to agent level, 'expectedOutput' removed entirely.",8,11
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' (integer) added to each agent for unique identification and referential integrity.",0,8
deduction,field_change,"Field 'tools' (array of strings) replaced with 'toolReferences' (empty arrays) - suggests future enhancement for tool management.",9,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' field in AAVA 2.0 reduces metadata completeness for output specification governance.",0,0
deduction,governance_issue,"Removal of structured 'task' object eliminates clear separation between task description and expected output.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field types and proper nesting structure.",0,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has empty 'toolReferences' arrays that may indicate incomplete migration.",0,12
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a major version change with breaking structural changes requiring downstream system updates.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Renamed fields and structural changes will break existing integrations expecting AAVA 1.0 schema format.",0,0
deduction,risk,"Loss of 'expectedOutput' metadata may impact automated validation and quality assurance processes.",0,0
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty 'toolReferences' arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool integration compared to explicit 'tools' arrays in AAVA 1.0.",9,12
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical workflow logic with 3 agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases.",0,0
deduction,general_finding,"Model specifications evolved from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating version progression in underlying AI models.",7,10
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 introduces more enterprise-ready structure with explicit IDs and hierarchical organization suitable for larger scale deployments.",0,0
