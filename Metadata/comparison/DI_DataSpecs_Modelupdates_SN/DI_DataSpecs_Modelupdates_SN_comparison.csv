deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include workflow metadata reorganization and agent definition schema evolution.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications model updates and functional test cases.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical across versions with consistent business logic and functional requirements.",5,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root-level structural reorganization: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with workFlowDetail object containing id/name (v2).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' representing architectural evolution.",5,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent schema significantly restructured: flat properties (v1) vs hierarchical with explicit IDs and references (v2).",5,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed from workflowId (1594) to workFlowDetail.id (2147) indicating version progression.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name evolved from workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with consistent semantic content.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming: agentName (v1) standardized to name (v2) for consistency.",8,6
deduction,field_change,"Model specification: model (v1) enhanced to modelDeploymentName (v2) with version upgrade gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",9,7
deduction,field_change,"Tool references: tools array (v1) replaced with toolReferences array (v2) - currently empty in v2.",10,8
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID type preserved as integer but value changed from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent identification enhanced with explicit agentId field (3885 3474 3545) in v2 for better referential integrity.",6,6
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task structure removed from v2: expectedOutput specifications no longer present in agent definitions.",12,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"Tool definitions completely absent in v2 agents - toolReferences arrays are empty.",10,8
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness reduced in v2: loss of detailed task structure and expected output specifications.",12,8
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from flat agent schema (v1) to structured agent registry pattern (v2) with explicit IDs and deployment references.",5,3
deduction,schema_evolution,"Workflow metadata containerization: simple properties (v1) to nested workFlowDetail object (v2).",2,2
deduction,risk,"Tool reference emptiness in v2 may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change requiring validation.",10,8
deduction,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata in v2 reduces specification completeness for downstream systems.",12,8
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear whether toolReferences emptiness in v2 is intentional design change or incomplete data migration.",10,8
deduction,general_finding,"Both JSON documents are syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no orphaned references.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count preserved (3 agents) with identical functional descriptions maintaining workflow integrity.",5,3
deduction,general_finding,"Model upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform evolution.",9,7
