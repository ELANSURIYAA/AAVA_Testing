deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and moderate governance degradation. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more normalized schema with enhanced agent identification but removes critical output specifications.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same business functions.",6,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: workflowId/workflowName flattened to workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Container rename: nodes array renamed to workflowAgents, indicating semantic evolution toward agent-centric model.",5,6
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier changed: workflowId (1594) to workFlowDetail.id (2147), indicating version progression.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name evolved: workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: agentName replaced with agentId (numeric) + name combination for better referential integrity.",7,8
deduction,field_change,"Model specification updated: model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Tool reference structure changed: tools array replaced with toolReferences array, currently empty in v2.",9,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Critical metadata loss: task wrapper object completely removed in AAVA 2.0, eliminating structured task definitions.",10,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed: expectedOutput field absent in AAVA 2.0, reducing governance and validation capability.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata quality degradation: removal of expectedOutput reduces contract clarity and downstream system integration guidance.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool configuration incomplete: toolReferences arrays are empty in AAVA 2.0, potentially indicating incomplete migration or configuration.",9,12
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification type change: agentName (string) replaced with agentId (integer) + name (string) for enhanced referential integrity.",7,8
deduction,constraint_change,"Workflow ID constraint change: workflowId direct integer access replaced with nested workFlowDetail.id access pattern.",2,3
deduction,schema_evolution,"Schema normalization: AAVA 2.0 adopts more normalized structure with separate identification and metadata concerns.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Agent-centric evolution: structural changes indicate shift from task-oriented to agent-oriented metadata model.",5,6
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: structural changes may break existing parsers expecting workflowId and nodes properties.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Integration risk: missing expectedOutput specifications may impact downstream validation and code generation systems.",11,
deduction,risk,"Tool configuration risk: empty toolReferences may indicate incomplete agent configuration or migration issues.",9,12
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax valid: well-formed structure with consistent property naming and data types.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1,"Internal consistency maintained: all agent references and tool configurations properly structured.",5,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax valid: well-formed structure with enhanced normalization.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"Minor inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase while workflowAgents uses different casing pattern.",2,6
deduction,correctness_aava_2,"Potential configuration issue: all toolReferences arrays empty, may indicate incomplete setup.",12,
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: agent descriptions remain identical between versions, maintaining functional specifications.",12,11
deduction,general_finding,"Model upgrade: consistent upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform evolution.",8,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Migration status unclear: empty toolReferences could indicate intentional removal or incomplete migration process.",9,12
