deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow metadata restructuring and agent definition schema changes. The evolution introduces better organization but removes critical task specification details.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a 3-agent workflow for data integration specifications. Agent purposes remain semantically identical despite naming variations.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 1 semantic alignment: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN (v1) maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN (v2) with identical core purpose - creating technical specifications from JIRA/Confluence inputs.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 2 semantic alignment: DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN (v1) maps to DI Delta Model Changes SN (v2) with preserved DMEA functionality for model evolution analysis.",32,20
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 3 semantic alignment: DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN (v1) maps to DI Functional Test Cases SN (v2) maintaining test case generation from JIRA specifications.",58,32
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow structure with workflowId/workflowName, while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (v1) restructured to 'workflowAgents' array (v2), indicating conceptual shift from generic nodes to specialized workflow agents.",4,6
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification evolution: Simple 'agentName' (v1) replaced with structured 'agentId' + 'name' approach (v2), introducing unique identifiers.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model specification enhancement: 'model' field (v1) evolved to 'modelDeploymentName' (v2), suggesting deployment-aware model management.",7,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool reference simplification: 'tools' array with string values (v1) replaced with 'toolReferences' empty arrays (v2), indicating architectural change in tool management.",8,44
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID type preservation: workflowId (1594) in v1 maps to workFlowDetail.id (2147) in v2, maintaining integer type but with value change indicating different workflow instance.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name evolution: workflowName 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' (v1) maps to workFlowDetail.name 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (v2) with underscore-to-space normalization.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming convention change: Underscore-separated names (v1) converted to space-separated names (v2) across all agents, improving readability.",6,9
deduction,type_change,"Model deployment specification: 'model': 'gpt-4' (v1) changed to 'modelDeploymentName': 'gpt-4.1' (v2), indicating version upgrade and deployment context.",7,10
deduction,missing_metadata,"Critical task structure removal: Complete 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' fields removed from AAVA 2.0, representing significant metadata loss.",9,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications lost: Detailed output format requirements, quality criteria, and formatting needs removed in v2, reducing governance capability.",30,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Cost estimation metadata removed: Token calculation and pricing formulas completely absent in AAVA 2.0, eliminating cost tracking capability.",31,
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool specification simplification: Populated tools arrays in v1 (e.g., 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z') replaced with empty toolReferences arrays in v2.",8,44
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degradation: AAVA 2.0 removes detailed task descriptions, output specifications, and quality criteria, reducing governance and traceability.",9,
deduction,governance_issue,"Documentation quality reduction: Loss of comprehensive instruction sets and formatting requirements impacts agent execution guidance and output consistency.",10,
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility concern: Structural changes in workflow and agent definitions may break existing systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Task execution ambiguity: Removal of detailed task specifications in v2 may lead to inconsistent agent behavior and reduced output quality.",9,
deduction,risk,"Tool integration uncertainty: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural changes that may impact agent capabilities.",44,44
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version evolution assessment: AAVA 2.0 represents a major version change with breaking structural modifications rather than backward-compatible enhancement.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Metadata model maturation: Introduction of agentId and structured workflow details suggests evolution toward more sophisticated metadata management.",8,8
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference interpretation: Empty toolReferences arrays in v2 create ambiguity about actual tool availability and usage patterns.",44,44
deduction,general_finding,"JSON validity confirmed: Both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 are syntactically valid JSON with proper structure and no parsing errors.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count preservation: Both versions maintain exactly 3 agents in the workflow, preserving the core processing pipeline structure.",4,6
deduction,general_finding,"Content length disparity: AAVA 1.0 contains significantly more detailed metadata (longer descriptions, comprehensive output specs) compared to AAVA 2.0's streamlined approach.",1,1
