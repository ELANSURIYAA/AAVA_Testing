deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The migration introduces enhanced organization with dedicated workflow detail objects and agent-specific metadata structures. Key improvements include standardized agent identification, enhanced model deployment naming, and consolidated tool references. However, structural changes may impact backward compatibility for systems expecting the original flat structure.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concepts remain semantically equivalent between versions. The DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains identical purpose and agent functionality across both versions.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions preserve identical business logic and technical specifications. All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain semantic consistency.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Model references evolved from simple 'gpt-4' to structured 'gpt-4.1' deployment naming, indicating version progression while maintaining semantic compatibility.",9,12
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical organization with workFlowDetail object containing id and name properties, replacing flat workflowId and workflowName structure.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata including agentId, modelDeploymentName, and toolReferences arrays.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool references migrated from inline 'tools' arrays to separate 'toolReferences' structure, improving modularity but changing access patterns.",11,45
deduction,field_change,"Root property 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root property 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with formatting change from underscore to space separation.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array property 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) maintaining same semantic purpose but different structural context.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) with addition of new 'agentId' property for enhanced identification.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model specification evolved from simple string 'gpt-4' to structured 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1' indicating deployment-aware versioning.",9,12
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed from direct string array to object-based 'toolReferences' array, potentially breaking direct tool name access patterns.",11,45
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId fields (3885, 3474, 3545) not present in AAVA 1.0, enhancing agent tracking capabilities.",7,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed from AAVA 2.0 agent definitions, potentially reducing specification completeness.",25,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference structure change may impact governance systems expecting direct tool name arrays rather than reference objects.",11,45
deduction,governance_issue,"Workflow identification pattern changed from simple numeric ID to structured object, affecting systems using direct ID references.",2,2
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration represents minor version evolution with structural improvements but maintains backward semantic compatibility through field mapping.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Systems directly accessing 'nodes' array will require code changes to use 'workflowAgents' array in AAVA 2.0.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Direct tool name access patterns (nodes[].tools[]) will break with new toolReferences structure requiring adaptation.",11,45
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID access patterns require migration from direct property to nested object access (workflowId vs workFlowDetail.id).",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON structure is syntactically valid with proper nesting, array structures, and string formatting throughout.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"All object references are internally consistent with no orphaned properties or circular dependencies detected.",1,

deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Agent ID references (3885, 3474, 3545) are unique and properly formatted as integers.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Tool references array structure is consistent across all agents, though currently empty, indicating potential incomplete migration.",45,
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference migration appears incomplete as all toolReferences arrays are empty, creating uncertainty about tool availability.",45,45
deduction,ambiguity,"Model deployment naming convention change from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' may indicate version upgrade or deployment environment change.",9,12
deduction,general_finding,"Overall migration demonstrates thoughtful structural evolution with improved organization and enhanced metadata tracking capabilities.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Semantic preservation is strong with all core workflow and agent functionality maintained across versions.",1,1
