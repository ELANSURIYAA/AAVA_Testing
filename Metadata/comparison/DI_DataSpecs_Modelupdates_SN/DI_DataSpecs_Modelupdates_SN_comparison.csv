deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and naming conventions. Major structural changes include object hierarchy reorganization and field renaming that may impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical business purpose and agent functionality.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically equivalent: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical business logic and objectives.",4,7
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions are identical across versions, confirming semantic preservation of agent responsibilities and expected outputs.",15,15
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved from simple fields (workflowId, workflowName) to structured object (workFlowDetail.id, workFlowDetail.name).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure including agentId and modelDeploymentName.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural access pattern changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Camel case 'workFlowDetail' introduces inconsistency with other naming.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' (line 4) to 'workflowAgents' (line 7). More descriptive but breaks backward compatibility.",4,7
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 9). Simplified naming but loses specificity.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10). Enhanced specificity for deployment context.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Tools field 'tools' (line 8) renamed to 'toolReferences' (line 82). More descriptive but structural change required.",8,82
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification enhanced: Added 'agentId' field (line 8) as integer identifier, improving referential integrity.",8,8
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools array structure changed: AAVA 1.0 uses string array, AAVA 2.0 uses empty array suggesting different tool reference mechanism.",8,82
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure remains identical in both versions, preserving complex nested description and expectedOutput content without modification.",15,15
deduction,governance_issue,"Inconsistent naming convention: 'workFlowDetail' uses mixed case while other fields use camelCase, reducing metadata quality.",2,2
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference mechanism unclear in AAVA 2.0: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or different tool association pattern.",82,82
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Field renames and structural changes will break existing systems expecting AAVA 1.0 schema without migration strategy.",1,1
deduction,risk,"API integration impact: Systems accessing workflowId and workflowName directly will fail with AAVA 2.0 nested structure.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Tool integration uncertainty: Changed tool reference mechanism may break existing tool associations and workflow execution.",8,82
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"All required fields present with appropriate data types: integer workflowId, string workflowName, array nodes.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Agent structure consistent across all three nodes with complete task definitions and tool arrays.",4,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and no syntax errors.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Nested workFlowDetail object properly structured with id and name fields maintaining data integrity.",2,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Agent objects include proper agentId integers and enhanced modelDeploymentName fields for better deployment tracking.",8,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents moderate schema enhancement with improved organization but significant compatibility impact.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Enhanced agent metadata (agentId, modelDeploymentName) suggests improved deployment and tracking capabilities.",8,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"Preserved task complexity indicates mature workflow definition that requires no business logic changes.",15,15
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool reference mechanism ambiguous: Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 compared to populated tools arrays in AAVA 1.0.",8,82
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, confirming business requirement preservation.",15,15
deduction,general_finding,"Model evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform upgrade while maintaining compatibility.",7,10
