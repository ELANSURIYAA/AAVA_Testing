deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose but introduces enhanced data modeling with agent IDs, improved tool references, and refined naming conventions. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve metadata governance.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same core business workflow for DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN with three primary agents handling technical specifications, delta model changes, and functional test cases. The semantic purpose and agent responsibilities remain consistent.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces a hierarchical workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure. This represents a significant architectural shift from simple key-value pairs to nested object modeling.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (1594) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2147) with value change indicating different workflow instance.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore to space) and moved to workFlowDetail.name.",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent array restructured from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata including agentId, modelDeploymentName, and toolReferences arrays.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent names evolved: 'DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN' to 'DI Data Technical Specification SN' (underscores to spaces) across all three agents.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model field changed from simple string 'gpt-4' to structured 'modelDeploymentName': 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade and enhanced model tracking.",8,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools structure completely redesigned from simple string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to complex 'toolReferences' array structure, though currently empty in AAVA 2.0.",9,58
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened: 'task.description' and 'task.expectedOutput' merged into single 'description' field, removing explicit output format separation.",11,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications removed from AAVA 2.0, potentially reducing metadata quality and governance clarity for downstream consumers.",45,
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent IDs introduced in AAVA 2.0 (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identification not present in AAVA 1.0, improving referential integrity.",6,8
deduction,risk,"Structural changes from flat to nested hierarchy may break existing parsers and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Removal of explicit expectedOutput specifications could impact automated validation and quality assurance processes.",45,
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor-to-major version evolution with breaking changes requiring migration planning for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure, proper nesting, and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure, though toolReferences arrays are empty, potentially indicating incomplete migration.",1,
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are no longer used or data migration is incomplete.",58,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent task descriptions indicating preserved functional requirements despite structural changes.",11,10
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 suggests this represents a different workflow instance rather than pure schema evolution.",2,3
