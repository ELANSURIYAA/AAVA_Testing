deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and agent definition standardization. The evolution introduces improved metadata organization but creates backward compatibility challenges.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains consistent - both versions define a data integration workflow for technical specifications and model updates. The business logic and agent responsibilities are semantically preserved across versions.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces a hierarchical workflow structure with workFlowDetail object containing id and name properties, replacing the flat workflowId and workflowName structure in AAVA 1.0.",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore removed).",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6) indicating semantic clarification of the contained objects.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) for consistency.",6,8
deduction,field_addition,"New field 'agentId' introduced in AAVA 2.0 (line 7) with values 3885, 3474, 3545 for respective agents, providing unique identifiers.",N/A,7
deduction,field_change,"Field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with value evolution from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field 'tools' array (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 11) but populated as empty arrays instead of containing tool names.",8,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task object structure remains identical in both versions with same 'description' and 'expectedOutput' properties and content.",11,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references are lost in AAVA 2.0 - AAVA 1.0 specified 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool but AAVA 2.0 shows empty toolReferences arrays.",9,11
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification evolved from string-based names to numeric IDs, improving referential integrity.",6,7
deduction,constraint_change,"Model deployment naming suggests versioning evolution (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1) indicating platform upgrade.",7,9
deduction,schema_evolution,"Overall schema evolution from flat workflow structure to nested object hierarchy improves metadata organization but breaks backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or intentional tool decoupling, requiring validation.",N/A,11
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID changes (1594 to 2147) and name formatting changes may break existing references and integrations.",2,3
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no orphaned references.",N/A,N/A
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with improved hierarchical structure and consistent field naming.",N/A,N/A
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional consistency.",11,10
deduction,general_finding,"Agent count remains consistent (3 agents) with same core responsibilities across versions.",4,6
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays create ambiguity about tool integration requirements in AAVA 2.0.",N/A,11
