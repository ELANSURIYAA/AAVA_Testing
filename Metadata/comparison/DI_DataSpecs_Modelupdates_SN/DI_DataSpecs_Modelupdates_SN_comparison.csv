deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization with nested objects and agent IDs while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes impact backward compatibility but improve metadata governance.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, and DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN maintain same functional objectives.",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions show 98% content similarity with identical business requirements and processing steps.",25,25
deduction,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with nested workFlowDetail object (v2).",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (v1) becomes 'workflowAgents' array (v2) with enhanced metadata structure.",5,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification enhanced: simple agentName (v1) expanded to agentId + name combination (v2).",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier: workflowId (1594) becomes workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic preservation with structural enhancement.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow naming: workflowName becomes workFlowDetail.name with consistent value preservation.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming: agentName field renamed to name with identical values maintained.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Model specification: model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Task structure: task object renamed to description with flattened structure.",9,11
deduction,field_change,"Tool references: tools array renamed to toolReferences with empty arrays in v2.",7,12
deduction,type_change,"Agent identification: string-based agentName replaced with integer agentId + string name combination.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Task definition: complex task object with description/expectedOutput flattened to single description string.",25,25
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool constraint relaxed: v1 requires specific tool names, v2 uses empty toolReferences arrays.",7,12
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed: v2 eliminates detailed expectedOutput sections present in v1.",50,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Cost estimation sections removed: v2 removes cost calculation requirements from all agents.",80,
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness reduced: v2 removes structured output format requirements and quality criteria.",45,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool integration weakened: v2 shows empty toolReferences where v1 specified concrete tool dependencies.",7,12
deduction,schema_evolution,"Major version evolution: structural reorganization suggests v2.0 represents significant architectural upgrade.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility broken: field renames and structural changes prevent direct v1 to v2 migration.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool dependency unclear: empty toolReferences in v2 may indicate incomplete migration or changed tool architecture.",7,12
deduction,risk,"Output format loss: removal of expectedOutput specifications may impact downstream system integration.",50,
deduction,risk,"Cost tracking eliminated: removal of cost estimation sections may impact operational monitoring.",80,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"JSON syntax valid: well-formed structure with consistent typing and proper nesting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency maintained: all agent references, tool names, and field relationships are logically consistent.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"No orphaned references: all tool references and agent names properly defined within scope.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"JSON syntax valid: well-formed structure with proper object nesting and array formatting.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Minor inconsistency: agentId values (3885, 3474, 3545) don't follow sequential pattern suggesting possible data migration artifacts.",8,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"Empty arrays consistent: all toolReferences arrays consistently empty across agents.",12,
deduction,general_finding,"Model upgrade: consistent upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform evolution.",8,10
deduction,general_finding,"Content preservation: core agent descriptions maintain 95%+ textual similarity despite structural changes.",25,25
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow scope unchanged: both versions define identical 3-agent workflow for data integration processes.",1,1
