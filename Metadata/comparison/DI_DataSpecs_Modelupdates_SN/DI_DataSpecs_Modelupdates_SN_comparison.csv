deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and naming conventions while preserving core semantic meaning. The evolution shows improved metadata governance with more descriptive field names and structured hierarchy.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical agent purposes and descriptions.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 1 (Technical Specification): Semantic meaning fully preserved despite name variations (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN vs DI Data Technical Specification SN).",6,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 2 (Delta Model Changes): Core functionality identical - both versions describe DMEA (Data Model Evolution Agent) with same 6-stage process.",33,25
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent 3 (Functional Test Cases): Test case generation logic and requirements completely aligned between versions.",58,40
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Array naming evolution: 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' reflecting better semantic clarity.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent identification enhanced: AAVA 2.0 adds explicit agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) for better referential integrity.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Model reference evolution: 'model' field renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",7,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tool reference restructuring: 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array, currently empty in AAVA 2.0.",8,55
deduction,field_change,"Workflow identifier: workflowId (1594) vs workFlowDetail.id (2147) - different values suggest version increment.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow naming: workflowName vs workFlowDetail.name - structural change with same semantic value.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent naming: agentName vs name - simplified field naming in AAVA 2.0.",6,9
deduction,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: 'gpt-4' upgraded to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version advancement.",7,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint change: AAVA 1.0 has populated tools array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'], AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences arrays.",8,55
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference data loss: AAVA 2.0 missing tool specifications that were present in AAVA 1.0, potentially impacting agent functionality.",8,55
deduction,governance_issue,"Field naming inconsistency: workFlowDetail uses camelCase inconsistently (workFlowDetail vs workflowAgents).",2,7
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes in workflow identification and agent referencing may break existing integrations.",2,2
deduction,risk,"Tool dependency risk: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or missing functionality.",8,55
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax valid: Proper structure, no broken references, consistent data types throughout.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency maintained: All agent references, tool specifications, and task descriptions are logically coherent.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax valid: Well-formed structure with proper nesting and data type consistency.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Internal consistency strong: Agent IDs, model references, and descriptions are logically structured, though toolReferences are empty.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution pattern: AAVA 2.0 represents a major structural refactoring with enhanced metadata organization and governance.",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Version progression: Workflow ID increment (1594 to 2147) and model version upgrade (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1) indicate systematic evolution.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Data completeness: AAVA 1.0 has 100% field population, AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences reducing completeness.",1,1
deduction,general_finding,"Naming convention improvement: AAVA 2.0 uses more descriptive field names (modelDeploymentName vs model, workflowAgents vs nodes).",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Tool migration ambiguity: Unclear whether empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 represent intentional removal or incomplete data migration.",8,55
