deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. Major architectural changes include workflow structure reorganization and enhanced agent metadata modeling.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same conceptual workflow for DI DataSpecs Modelupdates with three core agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. Business purpose and agent responsibilities remain semantically equivalent.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces a hierarchical workflow structure with workFlowDetail container and workflowAgents array, replacing the flat nodes array structure in AAVA 1.0. This represents a 35-point structural deviation.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value also changed from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' with space formatting.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Root array 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Structural hierarchy changed from flat to nested under workflow container.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 9). Semantic meaning preserved.",6,9
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 10). Values changed from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model version upgrade.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'tools' array (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' empty array (line 11). Tool configuration approach fundamentally changed.",8,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (line 8) as new unique identifier for agents, enhancing referential integrity and governance capabilities.",8,8
deduction,field_change,"Task structure remains identical in both versions with same description and expectedOutput content, preserving functional specifications.",12,12
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer 1594 to 2147, indicating this represents a different workflow instance or version.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool configuration mechanism changed from populated tools array to empty toolReferences array, potentially indicating external tool management.",8,11
deduction,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes explicit tool declarations (DI_Github_File_Writer_Z) from agent definitions, reducing metadata completeness for tool dependencies.",8,11
deduction,schema_evolution,"Introduction of workFlowDetail container suggests evolution toward more structured workflow metadata management with enhanced governance capabilities.",1,2
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may impact downstream systems expecting flat node array structure. Migration planning required for dependent analytics and governance tools.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Tool reference mechanism change could break existing tool dependency resolution if downstream systems rely on explicit tool declarations.",8,11
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All references are well-formed and no orphaned objects detected.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced hierarchical structure. All nested references are properly formed and consistent.",1,
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs, ensuring functional continuity despite structural evolution.",12,12
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform-wide enhancement while preserving agent capabilities.",7,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about actual tool dependencies and configuration management approach.",11,11
