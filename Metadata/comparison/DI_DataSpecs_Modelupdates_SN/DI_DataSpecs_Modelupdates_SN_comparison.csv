deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose but introduces enhanced data modeling with improved agent identification and tool reference management.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions define the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow with identical agent purposes and business logic. Core functionality for technical specification generation, delta model changes, and functional test cases remains semantically equivalent.",2,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization with nested workFlowDetail object, enhanced agent modeling with agentId fields, and improved tool reference architecture. The flat structure of AAVA 1.0 has been evolved to a more hierarchical design.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' (line 2) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' (line 3) renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4). Value format changed from underscore-separated to space-separated.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' (line 4) renamed to 'workflowAgents' (line 6). Semantic meaning preserved but improved naming convention.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' (line 6) renamed to 'name' (line 8) with addition of new 'agentId' field (line 7) for enhanced identification.",6,7
deduction,field_change,"Model field 'model' (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Tools array structure changed from simple string array 'tools' (line 8) to empty 'toolReferences' array (line 11), indicating architectural shift in tool management.",8,11
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure preserved but moved from 'task' (line 9) to 'description' (line 10), flattening the nested task structure.",9,10
deduction,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications removed from AAVA 2.0, reducing metadata completeness for governance and validation purposes.",,,
deduction,constraint_change,"Tool references architecture changed from populated array to empty array structure, potentially impacting tool dependency tracking.",8,11
deduction,type_change,"Workflow identification enhanced from simple integer ID to structured object with both ID and name, improving metadata richness.",2,2
deduction,naming_convention,"Consistent evolution from camelCase with underscores to proper camelCase naming (workflowId -> workFlowDetail, agentName -> name).",,,
deduction,version_evolution,"Model version upgraded from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents, indicating platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,risk,"Removal of 'expectedOutput' field may impact downstream systems expecting detailed output specifications for validation.",,,
deduction,risk,"Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or architectural changes that could affect tool dependency resolution.",,,
deduction,compatibility_issue,"Field path changes (workflowId -> workFlowDetail.id) require code updates in systems accessing workflow metadata.",2,3
deduction,data_quality,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agent IDs (3885, 3474, 3545) providing better entity tracking but removes task structure granularity.",,,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a minor version upgrade with breaking changes in field paths but preserved semantic meaning and business logic.",,,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax with consistent field naming and complete metadata structure.",,,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows valid JSON with improved hierarchical structure but some metadata incompleteness in tool references.",,,
