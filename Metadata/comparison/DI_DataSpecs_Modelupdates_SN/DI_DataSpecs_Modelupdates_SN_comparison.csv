deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The metadata has been reorganized with improved hierarchy and enhanced agent identification, but introduces breaking changes in field naming and structure that impact backward compatibility.",,
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose and agent functionality remain semantically equivalent between versions. All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) preserve their business logic and expected outputs.",3,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure, representing a fundamental architectural change.",1,1
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' renamed to 'id' within nested 'workFlowDetail' object.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' renamed to 'name' within nested 'workFlowDetail' object.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Array field 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced structure.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent field 'agentName' renamed to 'name' within agent objects.",6,9
deductions,type_change,"Field 'model' changed to 'modelDeploymentName' with version update (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",7,10
deductions,structural_change,"Tools array structure changed from simple string array to empty 'toolReferences' array, indicating architectural shift in tool management.",8,11
deductions,constraint_change,"Missing 'expectedOutput' field structure in AAVA 2.0 agent definitions, potentially breaking downstream consumers.",45,
deductions,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 introduces new fields (agentId, modelDeploymentName) without corresponding mappings in AAVA 1.0, creating potential integration challenges.",,8
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 contains malformed JSON structure in expectedOutput field with unescaped quotes and formatting issues.",45,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 has cleaner JSON structure but missing some expected output specifications present in AAVA 1.0.",,
deductions,risk,"Breaking changes in field naming and structure will require significant updates to dependent systems, ETL processes, and API consumers.",,
deductions,risk,"Model version changes (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1) may introduce behavioral differences in agent responses and processing.",,
deductions,ambiguity,"Unclear mapping strategy for tools migration from 'tools' array to 'toolReferences' structure.",,
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major version evolution with improved normalization but reduced backward compatibility.",,
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical core task descriptions and business requirements, indicating successful preservation of functional specifications.",12,12
deductions,general_finding,"Enhanced metadata structure in AAVA 2.0 provides better agent identification and deployment tracking capabilities.",,
