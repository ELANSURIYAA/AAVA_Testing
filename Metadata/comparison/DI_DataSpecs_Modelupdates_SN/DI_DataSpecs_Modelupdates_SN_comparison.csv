deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and normalization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include field renaming and hierarchical reorganization.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow (DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN) with identical business purpose and agent responsibilities.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent semantic alignment: All three agents maintain identical core functionality - Technical Specification (lines 6-7 vs 8-9), Delta Model Changes (lines 8-9 vs 15-16), and Functional Test Cases (lines 10-11 vs 22-23).",6,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName, while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array in AAVA 1.0 (line 3) becomes 'workflowAgents' array in AAVA 2.0 (line 5), improving semantic clarity.",3,5
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent property evolution: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field and renames 'agentName' to 'name', 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' for better specificity.",6,8
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier evolution: workflowId (1594) becomes id (2147) with different values, indicating version progression.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name normalization: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' becomes 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' with space formatting change.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming convention: 'agentName' field renamed to 'name' across all agents, maintaining semantic equivalence.",6,9
deductions,type_change,"Model specification enhancement: 'model' field becomes 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'.",7,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"Task structure consolidation: AAVA 1.0 separates 'description' and 'expectedOutput' in task object, AAVA 2.0 consolidates into single 'description' field.",8,11
deductions,field_change,"Tool reference evolution: 'tools' array with string values becomes 'toolReferences' array with empty arrays, suggesting architectural change in tool management.",7,11
deductions,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed: AAVA 2.0 lacks explicit 'expectedOutput' sections present in AAVA 1.0, reducing specification granularity.",8,
deductions,governance_issue,"Task content preservation: All agent task descriptions remain functionally identical despite structural changes, maintaining requirement integrity.",8,11
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 1.0 is well-formed JSON with consistent structure and no syntax errors.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_1.0,"Internal consistency: All agent references, tool names, and field relationships are logically consistent within AAVA 1.0.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 2.0 is well-formed JSON with proper nesting and no syntax errors.",1,1
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"Structural consistency: Agent IDs, names, and references maintain internal logical consistency in AAVA 2.0.",1,1
deductions,correctness_aava_2.0,"Tool reference inconsistency: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural change not fully implemented.",1,11
deductions,schema_evolution,"Version progression indicators: ID changes (1594→2147) and model upgrades (gpt-4→gpt-4.1) suggest systematic version advancement.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility concern: Field renames and structural changes may impact dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: Empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete tool migration or changed integration patterns.",7,11
deductions,ambiguity,"Specification completeness: Loss of explicit expectedOutput sections in AAVA 2.0 may reduce clarity for downstream consumers.",8,
deductions,general_finding,"Overall assessment: AAVA 2.0 represents a structured evolution with improved organization but introduces compatibility challenges and some metadata loss.",1,1
