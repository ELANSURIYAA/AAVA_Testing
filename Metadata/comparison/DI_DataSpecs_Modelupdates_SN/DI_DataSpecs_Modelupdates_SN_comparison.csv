deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural reorganization and moderate governance improvements. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced agent metadata structure while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration workflow for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow structure with nodes array, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object and workflowAgents array with enhanced agent metadata.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147. Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName (line 3) renamed to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with value change from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN. Minor formatting difference in naming.",3,4
deduction,structural_change,"Array nodes (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 6). Fundamental structural change in agent representation.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 8) across all agents. Semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deduction,field_addition,"New field agentId added in AAVA 2.0 (lines 7, 19, 31) providing unique agent identifiers. Enhancement for agent tracking.",0,7
deduction,field_change,"Field model (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 9) with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents. Indicates model evolution.",7,9
deduction,field_removal,"Field tools removed from AAVA 2.0. AAVA 1.0 line 8 shows tools array, completely absent in AAVA 2.0. Potential functionality reduction.",8,0
deduction,field_addition,"New field toolReferences added in AAVA 2.0 as empty arrays (lines 17, 29, 41). Suggests new tool reference architecture.",0,17
deduction,field_change,"Task structure preserved but field task.description content identical across versions. No semantic changes in agent descriptions.",11,10
deduction,field_removal,"Field task.expectedOutput removed from AAVA 2.0. Present in AAVA 1.0 lines 85, 113, 141 but absent in AAVA 2.0. Loss of output specification metadata.",85,0
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput field reduces metadata completeness and governance quality. Output specifications no longer documented in agent metadata.",85,0
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (1594) to integer (2147) but within nested structure. Type consistency maintained.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Tools constraint changed from array with values to empty toolReferences array. Functional constraint modification.",8,17
deduction,risk,"Removal of tools field and expectedOutput field may impact downstream systems expecting these metadata elements.",8,85
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with enhanced agent metadata structure but reduced output specification detail.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. All references are properly formed.",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure. Minor inconsistency in empty toolReferences arrays across agents.",0,1
deduction,ambiguity,"Relationship between tools field in AAVA 1.0 and toolReferences field in AAVA 2.0 is unclear. May represent architectural change.",8,17
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical agent descriptions indicating preserved functional requirements despite structural changes.",11,10
