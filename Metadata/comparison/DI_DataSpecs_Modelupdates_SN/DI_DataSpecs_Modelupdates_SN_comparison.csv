deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced metadata organization while preserving core semantic meaning. Major structural changes include nested object hierarchies and field renaming that impact backward compatibility.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a data integration workflow for DataSpecs Model updates with three sequential agents performing technical specification, delta model changes, and functional test case generation.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes remain semantically identical: Technical specification agent, Delta model changes agent, and Functional test cases agent maintain same business objectives and processing logic.",4,6
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Task descriptions are functionally equivalent with identical business requirements, processing steps, and output formats across both versions.",8,10
deductions,structural_analysis,"Root structure completely reorganized: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName/nodes, while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail and workflowAgents hierarchy.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed: workflowId (1594) and workflowName moved to nested workFlowDetail object with id (2147) and name fields.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure including agentId field.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata enhanced: AAVA 2.0 adds agentId field and renames 'model' to 'modelDeploymentName' with version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",5,7
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools handling modified: AAVA 1.0 uses 'tools' array with tool names, AAVA 2.0 uses 'toolReferences' array (empty in current data).",7,15
deductions,field_change,"workflowId renamed to workFlowDetail.id with value change from 1594 to 2147 indicating different workflow instances.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscores to spaces).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents array maintaining same semantic purpose but different structural organization.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"agentName renamed to name within agent objects, preserving semantic meaning with minor formatting changes.",5,8
deductions,field_change,"model field renamed to modelDeploymentName with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' across all agents.",6,9
deductions,field_change,"tools array replaced with toolReferences array, currently empty in AAVA 2.0 (potential data loss or migration incomplete).",7,15
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID changed from integer (1594) to nested object structure with id field (2147).",2,3
deductions,type_change,"Agent model specification evolved from simple string to structured modelDeploymentName with version information.",6,9
deductions,constraint_change,"Tool references constraint changed: AAVA 1.0 has populated tools array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] while AAVA 2.0 has empty toolReferences arrays.",7,15
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tool configuration missing in AAVA 2.0: First agent in AAVA 1.0 has 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool but corresponding toolReferences is empty in AAVA 2.0.",7,15
deductions,missing_metadata,"Agent IDs introduced in AAVA 2.0 (3885, 3474, 3545) provide enhanced traceability but no equivalent exists in AAVA 1.0.",5,7
deductions,governance_issue,"Task descriptions contain identical content including placeholder variables ({{Technical_Specifications}}, {{GitHub_Repo_Details}}) suggesting incomplete parameterization in both versions.",15,25
deductions,governance_issue,"Cost estimation sections contain identical placeholder text with incomplete token calculation logic in both versions.",45,55
deductions,risk,"Structural reorganization may break existing integrations expecting flat workflow structure from AAVA 1.0.",1,2
deductions,risk,"Tool reference changes could impact workflow execution if downstream systems depend on specific tool configurations.",7,15
deductions,risk,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral changes affecting output consistency.",6,9
deductions,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a minor version evolution with enhanced metadata organization and improved agent identification.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Backward compatibility compromised due to structural changes requiring adapter layer for systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task complexity and business logic while evolving the metadata container structure.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Agent sequence and dependencies preserved: Technical Specification → Delta Model Changes → Functional Test Cases workflow remains intact.",4,6
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent field types and proper array structures.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Minor issue: Contains placeholder variables in task descriptions that should be resolved before production use.",15,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency maintained with proper agent sequencing and tool references.",4,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced nested structure and proper object hierarchies.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Issue: Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or missing tool configurations.",15,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Enhanced metadata with agentId fields improves internal consistency and traceability.",7,
deductions,ambiguity,"Tool migration unclear: Uncertain whether empty toolReferences in AAVA 2.0 represents intentional removal or incomplete data migration.",7,15
deductions,ambiguity,"Workflow ID change significance unclear: Different IDs (1594 vs 2147) may represent different workflow instances or version evolution.",2,3
