deductions,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced organization and agent management while preserving core functionality. Major changes include structural reorganization from flat to nested hierarchy and enhanced agent metadata.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: Both versions define a data integration workflow with three sequential agents for technical specification, model changes, and functional testing. Business meaning remains consistent.",2,2
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent functionality alignment: All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, Functional Test Cases) maintain identical core descriptions and purposes across versions.",5,3
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName/nodes array. AAVA 2.0 introduces nested hierarchy with workFlowDetail object and workflowAgents array.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changes: workflowId (1594) vs id (2147) and workflowName vs name with formatting differences ('DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN').",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array in v1.0 renamed to 'workflowAgents' in v2.0. Semantic meaning preserved but structural change impacts parsing.",5,5
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: v1.0 uses 'agentName' while v2.0 introduces 'agentId' (numeric) and 'name' fields for better identification.",6,6
deductions,field_change,"Model specification evolution: 'model' field in v1.0 changed to 'modelDeploymentName' in v2.0 with version upgrade ('gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1').",8,8
deductions,field_change,"Tool reference restructuring: v1.0 'tools' array with string values changed to v2.0 'toolReferences' empty array, indicating architectural shift.",9,25
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID type consistency: Both versions use numeric IDs but different values (1594 vs 2147), suggesting different workflow instances.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Required field modifications: v2.0 introduces agentId as mandatory field while removing tools array constraint.",6,6
deductions,governance_issue,"Task structure inconsistency: v1.0 has nested task object with description/expectedOutput, v2.0 flattens description to agent level and removes expectedOutput field.",10,9
deductions,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degradation: v2.0 removes expectedOutput specifications that were present in v1.0, reducing governance documentation quality.",11,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Enhanced agent metadata: v2.0 introduces agentId for better tracking and modelDeploymentName for deployment-specific model references.",6,6
deductions,schema_evolution,"Tool architecture evolution: Shift from direct tool specification (v1.0) to tool reference architecture (v2.0) suggests microservices evolution.",9,25
deductions,ambiguity,"Missing expectedOutput: v2.0 removes detailed output format specifications present in v1.0, creating ambiguity in agent deliverables.",11,
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility impact: Structural changes from flat to nested hierarchy will break existing parsers and integrations expecting v1.0 format.",1,2
deductions,risk,"Tool integration risk: Removal of explicit tool specifications in v2.0 may impact tool binding and execution workflows.",9,25
deductions,correctness_aava1,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 1.0 is syntactically valid JSON with proper nesting and no structural errors.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"Internal consistency: All agent references, field types, and object relationships are logically consistent within v1.0.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"JSON syntax validation: AAVA 2.0 is syntactically valid JSON with proper nesting and no structural errors.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Field consistency issue: Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration from v1.0 tool specifications.",25,25
deductions,general_finding,"Agent count consistency: Both versions maintain exactly 3 agents in the workflow, preserving processing pipeline integrity.",5,5
deductions,general_finding,"Description preservation: All agent descriptions remain identical between versions, maintaining functional specifications.",10,9
deductions,general_finding,"Model upgrade: Consistent upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicates platform-wide model evolution.",8,8
