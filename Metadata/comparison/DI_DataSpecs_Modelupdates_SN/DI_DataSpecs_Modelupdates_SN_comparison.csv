deduction,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution of the workflow metadata model while preserving core semantic meaning. The reorganization introduces better encapsulation but breaks backward compatibility.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"All three agents maintain identical core functionality descriptions with 99% content preservation. Business logic and requirements remain unchanged.",8,11
deduction,structural_analysis,"Complete architectural redesign from flat nodes array to hierarchical workFlowDetail + workflowAgents structure. This represents a major version change.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root workflow identifier changed from workflowId to workFlowDetail.id with value change 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root workflow name changed from workflowName to workFlowDetail.name with minor formatting differences.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed from nodes to workflowAgents indicating semantic clarification.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property agentName renamed to name for consistency.",8,11
deduction,field_change,"Agent property model renamed to modelDeploymentName providing more specificity.",9,12
deduction,field_change,"Agent property tools renamed to toolReferences suggesting reference-based architecture.",10,17
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure completely removed from agent definition in AAVA 2.0.",11,
deduction,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput field removed from all agents reducing metadata completeness.",11,
deduction,type_change,"Model version updated from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents indicating platform evolution.",9,12
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of task.expectedOutput reduces documentation quality and governance traceability.",11,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"Minor JSON formatting inconsistency in tools array structure but syntactically valid.",10,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Empty toolReferences arrays suggest incomplete migration or architectural change.",17,
deduction,risk,"Breaking changes in root structure and agent schema will impact all downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Removal of expectedOutput field may break validation and documentation generation processes.",11,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration from AAVA 1.0 to 2.0 requires comprehensive transformation logic and backward compatibility handling.",1,1
deduction,ambiguity,"toolReferences structure unclear - empty arrays may indicate incomplete implementation or architectural shift.",10,17
deduction,general_finding,"Agent descriptions remain 100% identical preserving functional requirements and business logic.",15,13
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow maintains same three-agent composition: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases.",4,6
