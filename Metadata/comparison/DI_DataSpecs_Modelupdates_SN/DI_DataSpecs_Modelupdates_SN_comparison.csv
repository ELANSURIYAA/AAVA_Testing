deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces enhanced hierarchy and unique identifiers while preserving core semantic meaning. The evolution shows improved data governance with explicit agent IDs and enhanced model versioning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Workflow represents the same business process: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN with identical functional agents for technical specification, delta model changes, and functional test cases.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN in v1 maps to DI Data Technical Specification SN in v2 with preserved core functionality and identical task descriptions.",7,8
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN in v1 maps to DI Delta Model Changes SN in v2 with identical DMEA processing logic and requirements.",34,41
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN in v1 maps to DI Functional Test Cases SN in v2 with identical test case generation requirements and markdown output format.",61,74
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical workFlowDetail object replacing flat workflowId/workflowName structure, improving metadata organization.",1,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 replaces nodes array with workflowAgents array, maintaining same cardinality but enhancing semantic clarity.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces unique identifiers: workFlowDetail.id (2147) and agentId fields (3885, 3474, 3545) enabling better referential integrity.",2,8
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (1594) replaced by workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic preservation with structural enhancement.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with identical value 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (minor formatting difference).",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Field agentName renamed to name with consistent semantic meaning across all agents.",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Field model replaced by modelDeploymentName with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicating model evolution.",8,10
deduction,field_change,"Field tools array replaced by empty toolReferences array - potential tool integration architecture change.",9,11
deduction,type_change,"Model version upgraded from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents, indicating platform evolution while maintaining compatibility.",8,10
deduction,constraint_change,"AAVA 2.0 introduces mandatory agentId constraints improving data referential integrity.",7,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"AAVA 2.0 removes explicit tool references (DI_Github_File_Writer_Z) replacing with empty toolReferences arrays, potentially impacting tool dependency tracking.",9,11
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference architecture changed from explicit string arrays to empty toolReferences, requiring validation of tool integration patterns.",9,11
deduction,schema_evolution,"Evolution from flat to hierarchical structure represents major schema version change requiring migration planning for dependent systems.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Model version changes from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 may introduce behavioral differences requiring regression testing of agent outputs.",8,10
deduction,risk,"Tool reference architecture changes may break existing integrations expecting explicit tool arrays.",9,11
deduction,general_finding,"Both versions maintain identical task descriptions and expected outputs ensuring functional continuity despite structural changes.",10,12
deduction,general_finding,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates improved metadata governance with unique identifiers and enhanced hierarchical organization.",1,2
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and proper hierarchical organization.",1,
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow name formatting differs slightly: 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' vs 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' - underscore vs space convention inconsistency.",3,4
