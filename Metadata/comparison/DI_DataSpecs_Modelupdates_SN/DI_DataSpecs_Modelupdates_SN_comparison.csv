deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow definition has been modernized with enhanced agent modeling and improved metadata organization. However, structural changes introduce moderate backward compatibility concerns.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core business functionality remains intact across both versions. The workflow represents the same DI DataSpecs Modelupdates process with identical agent purposes and capabilities.",2,3
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent responsibilities are semantically equivalent: DI Data Technical Specification SN, DI Delta Model Changes SN, and DI Functional Test Cases SN maintain the same functional scope.",6,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat workflow properties (workflowId, workflowName) while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Agent container renamed from 'nodes' to 'workflowAgents' indicating conceptual shift in modeling approach.",4,7
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task structure completely flattened in AAVA 2.0. Task wrapper object removed and expectedOutput field eliminated.",25,8
deduction,field_change,"workflowId (line 2) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName (line 3) moved to workFlowDetail.name (line 4) with formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'",3,4
deduction,field_change,"nodes array (line 4) renamed to workflowAgents (line 7) maintaining same semantic purpose",4,7
deduction,field_change,"agentName (line 6) renamed to name (line 9) across all agent definitions",6,9
deduction,field_change,"model field (line 7) renamed to modelDeploymentName (line 10) with version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1'",7,10
deduction,field_change,"tools array (line 8) renamed to toolReferences (line 11) with structural change from string array to empty array",8,11
deduction,type_change,"Workflow identification changed from simple numeric ID to structured object with id and name properties",2,2
deduction,type_change,"Tool references changed from populated string array to empty array structure indicating different tool management approach",8,11
deduction,constraint_change,"Addition of agentId field (line 8) in AAVA 2.0 introduces new unique identifier constraint not present in AAVA 1.0",0,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput field completely removed from AAVA 2.0 reducing specification completeness and governance metadata",25,0
deduction,missing_metadata,"task wrapper object eliminated in AAVA 2.0 flattening the agent specification structure",10,0
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata reduces traceability and specification completeness in AAVA 2.0",25,0
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool configuration appears simplified but may impact tool dependency tracking",8,11
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and proper nesting",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"All object references are properly formed with no orphaned or broken relationships",1,0
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has inconsistent camelCase usage in workFlowDetail vs workflowAgents",2,7
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Empty toolReferences arrays may indicate incomplete migration or different tool management strategy",11,0
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major version evolution with breaking structural changes requiring migration effort",1,1
deduction,schema_evolution,"Introduction of agentId suggests move toward more robust agent identity management",0,8
deduction,schema_evolution,"Flattening of task structure indicates simplified agent definition model",10,8
deduction,risk,"Backward compatibility broken due to structural changes in workflow and agent definitions",1,1
deduction,risk,"Downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 structure will require updates to consume AAVA 2.0",1,1
deduction,risk,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata may impact automated validation and testing processes",25,0
deduction,ambiguity,"Inconsistent naming convention between workFlowDetail (camelCase with capital F) and workflowAgents (lowercase f)",2,7
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays unclear whether intentional design or incomplete data",11,0
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution alongside metadata structure changes",7,10
deduction,general_finding,"Agent naming conventions simplified from underscore-separated to space-separated format",6,9
deduction,general_finding,"Overall metadata quality maintained despite structural changes with core information preserved",1,1
