deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 with preserved semantic meaning but substantial architectural changes. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (SSIS to Python conversion) but introduces new organizational patterns and enhanced metadata structure.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core business functionality preserved: Both versions define a workflow for SSIS package documentation and Python conversion analysis. The semantic intent remains identical across all three agents.",2,2
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent purposes maintain semantic alignment: SSIS_Package_Documentation, SSIS_Package_to_Python_Analyzer, and SSIS_Package_to_Python_Plan serve identical business functions in both versions.",3,3
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' hierarchy.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification changed: workflowId/workflowName (v1) replaced with workFlowDetail.id/name nested structure (v2).",2,2
deduction,field_change,"Workflow ID field renamed: 'workflowId' (line 2) changed to 'workFlowDetail.id' (line 3) with different value (1447 vs 4139).",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Workflow name field restructured: 'workflowName' (line 3) moved to 'workFlowDetail.name' (line 4) with ampersand encoding difference.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (line 4) replaced with 'workflowAgents' array (line 6).",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent identification enhanced: Simple 'agentName' (line 6) replaced with structured 'agentId' + 'name' fields (lines 7-8).",6,7
deduction,field_change,"Model specification updated: 'model' field (line 7) renamed to 'modelDeploymentName' (line 9) with version change (gpt-4o vs gpt-4.1).",7,9
deduction,field_change,"Task structure flattened: Nested 'task' object (line 9) replaced with direct 'description' field (line 10).",9,10
deduction,field_change,"Tools reference modernized: Empty 'tools' array (line 8) replaced with 'toolReferences' array (line 85).",8,85
deduction,type_change,"Workflow ID data type preserved: Both versions use integer type for workflow identifier.",2,3
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent ID constraint added: AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId as unique identifier not present in v1.",7,7
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specification removed: AAVA 1.0 'expectedOutput' field (line 11) completely absent in AAVA 2.0.",11,
deduction,missing_metadata,"Task metadata reduced: AAVA 2.0 lacks the detailed task structure with expectedOutput specifications present in v1.",9,
deduction,governance_issue,"Metadata completeness degraded: Removal of expectedOutput reduces governance and validation capabilities.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Agent traceability improved: Addition of agentId enhances agent tracking and reference management.",6,7
deduction,schema_evolution,"Hierarchical organization introduced: AAVA 2.0 adopts more structured approach with workFlowDetail container.",2,2
deduction,schema_evolution,"Agent metadata enhanced: Introduction of agentId and modelDeploymentName provides better agent management.",6,7
deduction,ambiguity,"Workflow name encoding inconsistency: 'SSIS_Package_to_Python_Doc&Analyze' vs 'SSIS Package to Python Doc&Analyze' creates potential matching issues.",3,4
deduction,risk,"Breaking change in structure: Flat nodes array to nested workflowAgents requires significant parsing logic updates.",4,6
deduction,risk,"Expected output loss: Removal of expectedOutput field may impact validation and testing frameworks.",11,
deduction,risk,"Model version drift: Change from gpt-4o to gpt-4.1 may affect processing behavior and compatibility.",7,9
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper nesting and data types.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 internal consistency: All references and structures are internally consistent.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON syntax validation: Valid JSON structure with proper nesting and data types.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 internal consistency: Minor inconsistency in camelCase usage (workFlowDetail vs workflowAgents).",2,6
deduction,general_finding,"Business logic preservation: All three agents maintain identical core functionality and task descriptions across versions.",6,7
deduction,general_finding,"Architectural modernization: AAVA 2.0 introduces more sophisticated metadata organization patterns.",1,1
