**MASTER METADATA OVERVIEW TABLE**

| Metadata Aspect             | Metadata Fields Compared                     | Comparison Method                | Result                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Workflow Identifier         | workflowId vs workFlowDetail.id              | Exact integer match              | Different                        |
| Workflow Name               | workflowName vs workFlowDetail.name          | Normalized string comparison     | Different                        |
| Agent Count                 | nodes vs workflowAgents (array length)       | Integer count                    | Different (1 vs 5)               |
| Agent Definitions           | Agent-level fields per matched pair          | Field-by-field comparison        | 1 matched, 4 unmatched (2.0 only)|
| Model References            | model vs modelDeploymentName                 | Exact string match               | Different                        |
| Tool Declarations           | tools vs toolReferences                      | Set comparison                   | Not Declared                     |
| Task Descriptions           | task.description vs description              | Textual similarity               | Equivalent (for matched agent)    |
| Overall Metadata Compatibility | All dimensions combined                   | Weighted assessment              | Partially Equivalent              |

- Only declarative metadata fields were compared, including workflow IDs, names, agent definitions, model references, and tool declarations.
- The comparison scope is strictly configuration-level; no execution, runtime, or functional aspects were analyzed.
- Key findings: field and structure changes (flat to nested), agent name normalization required, model and workflow IDs differ, tool arrays are empty in both.
- Limitations: No runtime or functional validation performed; report is configuration-focused only.
- Methodology: Field-by-field, deterministic, and explainable; all verdicts are based solely on metadata present in the files.

---

**Comparison Scope & Methodology**

**What Was Compared:**
- Declarative metadata fields from workflow JSON files.
- Workflow identifiers and names.
- Agent definitions (names, models, task descriptions).
- Tool declarations.
- Output specifications (if present).

**Comparison Methods Used:**
- Exact value matching (integers, strings).
- Normalized string comparison (names, descriptions).
- Set comparison (tool arrays).
- Structural presence checks (field existence).

**What Was NOT Compared:**
- Execution order or sequencing.
- Runtime behavior or performance.
- Control flow or orchestration logic.
- Functional correctness or business outcomes.
- Code quality or implementation details.

**Limitations:**
- This is a configuration-level comparison only.
- No execution or testing was performed.
- Verdicts are based solely on declared metadata.
- Actual runtime compatibility cannot be determined from metadata alone.

- This report is strictly metadata-only and does not infer or validate runtime behavior.
- All comparisons are field-level and deterministic.
- Limitations are acknowledged: this is not a functional or runtime assessment.
- The purpose is to assess configuration compatibility, not functional equivalence.

---

**Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Compared:** workflowId vs workFlowDetail.id, workflowName vs workFlowDetail.name, JSON structure.
- **Comparison Rule:** Exact match for IDs, normalized match for names, structural analysis for nesting.
- **Exclusions:** No execution order, dependency, or orchestration metadata analyzed.

| Metadata Field            | AAVA 1.0 Value                              | AAVA 2.0 Value                            | Comparison Method     | Result    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Workflow ID Field Name    | workflowId                                  | workFlowDetail.id                         | Field name comparison | Different |
| Workflow ID Value         | 7885                                        | 2603                                      | Exact integer match   | Different |
| Workflow Name Field Name  | workflowName                                | workFlowDetail.name                       | Field name comparison | Different |
| Workflow Name Value       | DI_Teradata_to_Snowflake_Conversiontester   | DI Teradata To Snowflake Conversion        | Normalized string match | Different |
| JSON Structure            | Flat                                        | Nested (workFlowDetail object)            | Structural analysis   | Different |
| Agent Array Field Name    | nodes                                       | workflowAgents                            | Field name comparison | Different |

- Field naming conventions have changed: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure and camelCase; AAVA 2.0 uses nested structure and camelCase with more descriptive field names.
- Structural differences mean migration requires explicit field mapping.
- These are configuration-level changes only; no functional implications are inferred.
- Workflow IDs and names do not match between versions.

**Agent Inventory Comparison**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Compared:** agentName (1.0) vs name (2.0)
- **Comparison Rule:** Normalized string matching (lowercase, remove underscores/spaces/prefixes)
- **Exclusions:** No behavioral or functional analysis; presence check only

| Agent Name (Normalized)         | AAVA 1.0 (Exact Field Value)                | AAVA 2.0 (Exact Field Value)                    | Matching Status        |

Summary Counts:

| Category                 | Count | Explanation                                    |
|--------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Agents in AAVA 1.0 Only  | 0     | Declared in 1.0, no normalized match in 2.0    |
| Agents in AAVA 2.0 Only  | 4     | Declared in 2.0, no normalized match in 1.0    |
| Matched Agents           | 1     | Normalized names match between versions        |
| Total Unique Agents      | 5     | All unique normalized names                    |

- Agent matching is based on normalized name metadata only, not functionality.
- Four agents are present only in AAVA 2.0; only one agent is matched across versions.
- Differences in field names (agentName vs name) reflect schema changes.

| Task Description  | task.description   | [See below, truncated]                 | description        | [See below, truncated]                 | Textual similarity    | Equivalent    |
| Expected Output   | task.expectedOutput| A detailed test case document, Pytest script, and cost analysis. | (no direct field)   | Not present                            | Field presence        | Missing in 2.0|
| Tool References   | tools              | []                                     | toolReferences     | []                                     | Set comparison        | Not Declared  |

- Model reference changed from "gpt-4" to "gpt-4.1" (configuration update).
- "agentId" is a new field in AAVA 2.0.
- Expected output field is present in 1.0 but not explicitly in 2.0.
- Tool references are not declared in either version (empty array).

**Unmatched Agents (AAVA 2.0 Only):**
- DI Teradata To Snowflake Converter
- DI Teradata To Snowflake UnitTest
- DI Teradata To Snowflake ReconTest
- DI Teradata To Snowflake Reviewer

- Present in: AAVA 2.0 only
- Status: No corresponding agent found in AAVA 1.0
- Impact: Configuration gap; cannot perform field-level comparison

**Agent Intent Classification Comparison**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Analyzed:** task.description (1.0) and description (2.0) content
- **Classification Method:** Keyword and pattern analysis to infer declared purpose
- **Comparison Rule:** Intent category must match for equivalence

| Agent (Matched Pairs)                  | AAVA 1.0 Intent Category | AAVA 2.0 Intent Category | Classification Basis                      | Intent Match |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| DI Teradata To Snowflake ConversionTester | Testing/Validation      | Testing/Validation      | "test cases", "Pytest script", "validate" | ✓ Equivalent|

Intent Distribution Summary:

| Intent Category         | AAVA 1.0 Count | AAVA 2.0 Count | Change |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Conversion/Transformation | 0              | 1              | +1     |
| Testing/Validation        | 1              | 2              | +1     |
| Review/Audit              | 0              | 1              | +1     |

| Token/Size Estimation     | 0              | 0              | 0      |
| Workflow Execution        | 0              | 0              | 0      |
| Merging/Consolidation     | 0              | 0              | 0      |
| Generic/Unclear           | 0              | 1              | +1     |

- Intent classification is based solely on description field text.
- Declared purposes align for the matched agent.
- No functional validation is performed; intent categories are metadata-level only.

---

**Model Reference Metadata Comparison**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Compared:** model (1.0) vs modelDeploymentName (2.0)
- **Comparison Rule:** Exact string match

| Agent (Matched Pairs)                  | AAVA 1.0 Model | AAVA 2.0 Model | Field Name Change         | Model Match |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| DI Teradata To Snowflake ConversionTester | gpt-4         | gpt-4.1        | model → modelDeploymentName | Different   |

Model Distribution Summary:

| Model Reference | AAVA 1.0 Agent Count | AAVA 2.0 Agent Count | Change |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| gpt-4           | 1                   | 0                    | -1     |
| gpt-4.1         | 0                   | 5                    | +5     |

- Field name changed from "model" to "modelDeploymentName".
- Model string changed for the matched agent, representing a configuration update.
- No performance or capability comparison is made.

---

**Tooling Metadata Availability**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Compared:** tools (1.0) vs toolReferences (2.0)
- **Comparison Rule:** Set comparison; presence check if arrays empty

| Agent (Matched Pairs)                  | AAVA 1.0 Tools | AAVA 2.0 Tools | Tool Availability Status       |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| DI Teradata To Snowflake ConversionTester | []           | []             | Not Declared in Either        |

Integration Points Summary:

| Integration Type | AAVA 1.0 Presence | AAVA 2.0 Presence | Comparison     |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| S3 Storage       | Not Declared      | Not Declared      | Same          |
| GitHub           | Not Declared      | Not Declared      | Same          |
| Jira             | Not Declared      | Not Declared      | Same          |
| Databricks       | Not Declared      | Not Declared      | Same          |
| Custom Tools     | None              | None              | Same          |

- Tool declarations are empty in both versions; no tools are configured at metadata level.
- Empty arrays mean "Not Declared" and do not imply tool usage.
- No validation of actual tool integration or availability is performed.

---

**Execution & Orchestration Metadata Availability**

**Analysis:**
The provided JSON files contain agent definitions and task descriptions but do NOT include:
- Execution order or sequencing metadata
- Dependency declarations between agents
- Control flow, branching, or conditional logic
- Orchestration rules or workflow state management
- Trigger conditions or event handlers

**Findings:**
- **Execution Order:** Not declared in either version
- **Agent Dependencies:** Not declared in either version
- **Control Flow Logic:** Not declared in either version
- **Orchestration Metadata:** Not declared in either version

**Implication:**
Without execution metadata, this comparison cannot assess:
- Whether agents execute sequentially, in parallel, or conditionally
- Whether there are dependencies or data flows between agents
- Whether control logic or branching exists in practice

**Verdict:**
Both versions lack explicit execution and orchestration metadata. Any execution behavior would be determined by the runtime platform, not the workflow JSON definition.

- Absence of execution metadata in both files is a limitation of this comparison.
- No inference about runtime behavior or sequencing can be made.
- Only declarative agent lists are available for configuration analysis.

---

**Output Specification Metadata Comparison**

**Comparison Basis:**
- **Fields Compared:** task.expectedOutput (1.0) vs (field presence in 2.0, if any)
- **Comparison Rule:** Textual similarity if both present; presence check otherwise

| Agent (Matched Pairs)                  | AAVA 1.0 Output Spec                       | AAVA 2.0 Output Spec | Field Presence | Output Spec Match |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| DI Teradata To Snowflake ConversionTester | A detailed test case document, Pytest script, and cost analysis. | Not Declared        | 1.0 Only      | Missing          |

- Output specification is only present in AAVA 1.0 for the matched agent.
- Missing output spec in 2.0 indicates a configuration change.
- Output spec is declarative only; no validation of actual output or compliance is performed.

---

**Missing / Added Metadata Fields**

**Metadata Fields Present in AAVA 1.0 but Not in AAVA 2.0:**

| Field Name     | Field Location    | Impact                              |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| workflowId     | Workflow level   | Replaced by workFlowDetail.id       |
| workflowName   | Workflow level   | Replaced by workFlowDetail.name     |
| nodes          | Workflow level   | Replaced by workflowAgents          |
| model          | Agent level      | Replaced by modelDeploymentName     |
| task           | Agent level      | Flattened; task.description → description |
| task.expectedOutput | Agent level | Not present in 2.0                  |

**Metadata Fields Present in AAVA 2.0 but Not in AAVA 1.0:**

| Field Name           | Field Location    | Impact                              |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| workFlowDetail       | Workflow level   | New nested structure                |
| agentId              | Agent level      | New agent identifier field          |
| modelDeploymentName  | Agent level      | Replaces "model" field              |
| toolReferences       | Agent level      | Replaces "tools" field (may be empty)|

**Critical Missing Metadata:**
- None that would prevent field mapping; all fields can be mapped with configuration updates.

- Field name changes reflect schema evolution between versions.
- Structural differences (flat vs nested) require explicit field mapping.
- Missing/added fields are configuration-level, not functional losses/gains.
- Field renaming and restructuring are common in version upgrades.

**Metadata Compatibility Assessment**

| Compatibility Dimension         | Assessment Basis                       | Verdict                      | Justification                                 |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Structural Compatibility        | JSON structure, field names, nesting   | Partially Compatible         | Flat (1.0) vs nested (2.0); field name changes|
| Agent Definition Compatibility  | Agent count, names, presence           | Partially Compatible         | 1 matched, 4 unmatched agents in 2.0          |
| Model Reference Compatibility   | model vs modelDeploymentName values    | Different                    | Model string changed for matched agent        |
| Tool Declaration Compatibility  | tools vs toolReferences arrays         | Not Declared                 | Both versions have empty tool arrays          |
| Intent Alignment                | Intent classification from descriptions| Equivalent                   | Intent matches for matched agent              |
| Output Specification Compatibility | task.expectedOutput presence and content | Not Declared/Different      | Output spec missing in 2.0 for matched agent  |
| **Overall Metadata Compatibility** | **Weighted combination of all dimensions** | **Partially Equivalent**     | **Structural changes, agent gaps, field renames** |

**Configuration-Level Migration Assessment:**

| Assessment Aspect               | Status         | Explanation                                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Field Mapping Required?         | Yes           | workflowId → workFlowDetail.id, etc.              |
| Structural Adaptation Required? | Yes           | Flat to nested conversion needed                  |
| Model Reference Updates Required?| Yes           | model → modelDeploymentName, gpt-4 → gpt-4.1      |
| Agent Remapping Required?       | Yes           | 4 agents in 2.0 not present in 1.0                |
| **Overall Configuration Reusability** | **Reusable with Modifications** | **Field and structure changes must be addressed** |

- Overall metadata compatibility is "Partially Equivalent" due to field, structure, and agent definition changes.
- Migration will require explicit field mapping and adaptation to the new schema.
- Agent and model reference updates are necessary for configuration reuse.
- Metadata compatibility does not guarantee runtime or functional compatibility.
- Field mapping is feasible; runtime testing is required for functional validation.

---

**Final Summary**

**Metadata Comparison Results:**
- Only one agent is matched between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 after normalization; four agents are present only in AAVA 2.0.
- Workflow identifiers, names, and model references differ; structural changes from flat to nested JSON are present.
- Tool declarations are not present in either version; output specification is missing in 2.0.

**Metadata Compatibility Verdict:**
Partially Equivalent – Field, structure, and agent definition differences require explicit mapping and schema adaptation.

**Configuration-Level Migration Assessment:**
Reusable with Modifications – Migration will require field renaming, structure adaptation, and agent definition updates.

**Critical Limitations:**
- This comparison analyzed declarative metadata fields only.
- No execution, runtime behavior, or functional validation was performed.
- Actual workflow compatibility requires runtime testing and validation.
- Metadata equivalence does not guarantee functional equivalence.
- Migration decisions should be based on both metadata AND functional testing.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Review field mapping requirements for structural differences.
- Update model references as needed.
- Validate agent definitions and tool configurations.
- Perform runtime testing to validate functional compatibility.
- Conduct integration testing with actual data and workflows.
