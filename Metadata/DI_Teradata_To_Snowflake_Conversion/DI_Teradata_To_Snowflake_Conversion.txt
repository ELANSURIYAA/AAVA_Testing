- Compared workflow structure, agent inventory, intent (via task/description), tool references, model metadata, control flow, and output specifications.
- Workflows use different identifiers and agent counts; only one agent is matched by normalized name and intent.
- AAVA 2.0 introduces additional agents focused on conversion, unit testing, reconciliation, and review.
- All comparisons are strictly metadata-based; no execution or business logic assumptions are made.
- Migration is feasible with targeted modifications; direct replacement is not possible due to structural and model differences.

**Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison**

| Metadata Field            | AAVA 1.0 Value         | AAVA 2.0 Value                 | Status          |
|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Workflow ID Field Name    | workflowId             | workFlowDetail.id               | Different       |
| Workflow ID Value         | 7885                   | 2603                            | Different       |
| Workflow Name Field Name  | workflowName           | workFlowDetail.name             | Different       |
| Workflow Name Value       | DI_Teradata_to_Snowflake_Conversiontester | DI Teradata To Snowflake Conversion | Different       |
| JSON Structure Style      | Flat                   | Nested                          | Different       |
| Agent Array Field Name    | nodes                  | workflowAgents                  | Different       |

- AAVA 1.0 uses flat fields (`workflowId`, `workflowName`), while AAVA 2.0 nests metadata under `workFlowDetail`.
- Agent arrays are named differently: `nodes` (1.0) vs. `workflowAgents` (2.0).
- Field naming and structure changes require mapping for migration.
- These differences impact direct metadata reusability and necessitate conversion logic.

**Metadata Compatibility Assessment**

| Compatibility Dimension        | Verdict                 | Justification                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Compatibility      | Partially Compatible    | Different workflow/agent structures, only one agent matched, field names and nesting differ        |
| Intent Compatibility          | Equivalent              | Matched agent has equivalent testing/validation intent                                             |
| Tool Compatibility            | Equivalent              | No tools in either workflow for the matched agent                                                  |
| Model Compatibility           | Different               | 1.0 uses "gpt-4", 2.0 uses "gpt-4.1" and more models                                              |
| Control Flow Compatibility    | Equivalent              | Equivalent validation/test execution logic in matched agent                                         |
| Output Specification Compatibility | Equivalent         | Both define detailed test case documents, Pytest scripts, and cost analysis as output              |
| **Overall Metadata Equivalence** | **Partially Equivalent** | **Most dimensions align for the matched agent, but structural and model differences prevent full equivalence** |

**Migration Reusability Assessment:**

| Assessment Aspect                  | Status               |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Can AAVA 2.0 Directly Replace AAVA 1.0? | No               |
| Metadata Redesign Required?        | Moderate             |
| Agent Mapping Possible?            | Partially            |
| Tool Migration Feasible?           | Yes                  |
| **Overall Reusability Verdict**    | **Reusable with Modifications** |

- Structural and model differences require metadata transformation and mapping for migration.
- Only one agent can be directly mapped; new agents in 2.0 require additional integration.
- No tool migration is needed for matched agents; models differ and require update.
- Migration effort is moderate, with reusability possible after targeted changes.
- Compatibility risks include field name mapping and workflow structure adaptation.

---

**Final Summary:**

AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflows exhibit partially equivalent metadata structures, with 1 matched agent out of 5 total. Intent, control flow, output, and tool compatibility are equivalent for the matched agent, but differences in workflow structure, agent inventory, and model references require moderate redesign for migration. The workflows are reusable with modifications, and direct replacement is not possible without structural adaptation.
