- Compared workflow structure, agent definitions, intent classification, tool references, model deployments, control flow, output specifications, and field naming conventions.
- Both workflows have identical agent sets and intent distribution; however, workflow identifiers and model references differ.
- No agents or tools are missing or extra; naming conventions and metadata field names vary between versions.
- This is a strict metadata-only comparison—no execution or runtime behavior was analyzed.
- Migration is feasible with minor model and identifier adjustments; direct reusability is possible with targeted modifications.

| Workflow Name Value     | ABAP_To_Pyspark_Convert  | ABAP To Pyspark Convert         | Different      |
| JSON Structure Style    | Flat                     | Nested (workFlowDetail + agents)| Different      |
| Agent Array Field Name  | nodes                    | workflowAgents                  | Different      |

- AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with 'workflowId' and 'workflowName'; AAVA 2.0 uses nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents'.
- Field naming conventions differ: underscores in 1.0, camel case/nested in 2.0.
- Workflow identifiers and names are not the same; migration may require mapping.
- Agent array field names are distinct, requiring structural adaptation for migration.

**Migration Reusability Assessment:**

| Assessment Aspect                  | Status         |
|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Can AAVA 2.0 Directly Replace AAVA 1.0? | Partially    |
| Metadata Redesign Required?        | Minimal       |
| Agent Mapping Possible?            | Yes           |
| Tool Migration Feasible?           | Yes           |
| **Overall Reusability Verdict**    | **Reusable with Modifications** |

- Metadata equivalence is high, with only field name and model reference differences.
- Agent mapping is direct; no missing or extra agents.
- Migration effort is minimal, requiring updates to workflow identifiers and model deployment references.
- No redesign needed for intent, tool, control flow, or output specifications.
- Compatibility risks are limited to structural adaptation and model mapping.

---

**Final Summary:**

AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflows exhibit partially equivalent metadata structures with all 5 agents matched and identical intent, tool, control flow, and output specifications. Structural and model reference differences require minimal mapping, making the workflows reusable with targeted modifications for migration purposes. No critical metadata is missing, and direct agent mapping is feasible.
