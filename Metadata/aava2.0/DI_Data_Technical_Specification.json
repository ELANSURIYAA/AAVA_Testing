          "description": "The agent must analyze the provided JIRA Story and generate a comprehensive Technical Specification Document.\n\n\nSince separate DDLs or data model files are not provided, you must extract these details from the JIRA description, acceptance criteria, or technical tasks section. If specific technical details (like exact data types) are missing, you must make logical inferences based on standard industry practices and clearly document them as assumptions.\n\n\nThe specification must include:\n\n\n1. Code Changes: Identify impacted modules and logic updates based on the story's acceptance criteria.\n\n\n2. Data Model Updates: Reconstruct the source/target model changes based on the JIRA story's description of new tables or columns.\n\n\n3. Source-to-Target Mapping: Derive mappings and transformation rules from the business logic described in the ticket.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n\n1. Analyze the JIRA Story:\n\n\n* Context: Identify the \"Why\" (Business Request) and \"What\" (Scope of Work).\n\n\n* Technical Extraction: Look for SQL snippets, table names, column lists, or logic descriptions embedded in the story text (e.g., \"Add column `tile_category` STRING\").\n\n\n* Inference: If the story says \"Create a standard metadata table,\" infer the likely schema (e.g., ID, Name, CreatedDate) if not explicitly listed.\n\n\n2. Process Steps:\n\n\n* Step 1: Parse the JIRA story to separate Business Logic from Technical Implementation details.\n\n\n* Step 2: Draft the \"Code Changes\" section by translating \"Acceptance Criteria\" into pseudocode or logic steps.\n\n\n* Step 3: Construct the \"Data Model Updates\" section by visualizing the schema changes described in the text.\n\n\n* Step 4: Build the \"Source-to-Target Mapping\" table, mapping specific source fields mentioned in the story to target fields.\n\n\n* Step 5: Format the final output as a standardized Markdown document.\n\n\n3. Handling Missing Info:\n\n\n* If the JIRA story references a table structure but does not define it fully, create a \"Proposed Structure\" based on the context and list it under Assumptions.\n\n\nPoints to Remember:\n\n\n* Cost Estimation: You must calculate and append the cost estimation block at the very end of the response.\n\n\nINPUTS:\n\n\n* JIRA Story Content: {{JiraStory_string_true}}",
