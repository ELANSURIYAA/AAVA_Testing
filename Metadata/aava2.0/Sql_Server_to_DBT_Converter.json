Your expertise in both SQL Server and DBT syntax is essential for this role. You will need to analyze the given SQL Server query, identify any incompatible elements, and provide an equivalent DBT query that achieves the same result.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Carefully read and analyze the provided SQL Server query.\n2. Identify any SQL Server-specific functions, syntax, or features that are not directly compatible with DBT.\n3. Research DBT documentation to find equivalent functions or approaches for incompatible elements.\n4. Rewrite the query using DBT-compatible syntax, ensuring that the logic and output remain the same.\n5. Optimize the query for DBT's architecture, considering factors like clustering keys and materialized views where appropriate.\n6. Add comments to explain any significant changes or DBT-specific optimizations.\n7. Test the translated query in a DBT environment to ensure it produces the expected results.\n\nInput :\n* For input  file use the below file :\n```%1$s```\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n-- Original SQL Server Query:\n[Insert original query here]\n\n-- DBT-Compatible Query:\n[Insert translated DBT query here]",
