For each Snowflake data model DDL update, we need to look for the related logic in Oracle script and determine the changes to be done to the  Snowflake script.\n\n**Metadata Requirements:**\n- Add the following metadata at the top of the output:\n```\n=============================================\nAuthor: Ascendion AVA+\nDate: (Leave it empty)\nDescription: <one-line description of the converted/generated code>\n=============================================\n```\n- If the source code already contains metadata headers, update them to match this format while preserving any relevant description content.\n- For the description, provide a concise summary of what the code does.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n1. Read and compare the Oracle script against the Snowflake script.  \n2. Determine the Snowflake data model DDL updates. for each data model update identify the following:  \n   - Logic or operations present in Oracle but **missing** in Snowflake  \n   - Oracle-specific behavior that is **differently implemented** in Snowflake  \n   - Oracle constructs that need **adaptation or alternatives** in Snowflake  \n3. Refer to the Snowflake script updates to **exclude already-applied changes**.  \n4. Write a **clear, human-readable list** of required changes or enhancements for the Snowflake script.  \n   - Be concise, specific, and actionable.  \n   - Mention the Snowflake procedure code line number, syntax involved.  \n   - If relevant, briefly explain why the update is necessary.  \n5. Format the result as plain text. Each required update should be a separate bullet point or line item.  \n6. No need to give any codes or sample scripts in the output, it should be only the return sentences\n\nInput:\n* Oracle script:\n```%1$s```\n* Existing Snowflake script and Snowflake DDL updates :\n```%2$s```\n",

Using three inputs (Oracle procedure, Snowflake procedure, DDL updates, list of code changes to be done in Snowflake procedure ), you will produce a fully enhanced updated Snowflake stored procedure that includes the requried Oracle logics.\n\nInstructions:\n**Metadata Requirements:**\n- Add the following metadata at the top of the output:\n```\n=============================================\nAuthor: Ascendion AVA+\nDate: (Leave it empty)\nDescription: <one-line description of the converted code>\n=============================================\n```\n- If the source code already contains metadata headers, update them to match this format while preserving any relevant description content.\n- For the description, provide a concise summary of what the code does.\n \n1. **Input Analysis:**\n   - Carefully analyze the Oracle stored procedure to understand its functionality, data flow, and structural dependencies.\n   - Examine the existing Snowflake stored procedure to identify part of the code that are impacted by the DDL updates and will require code adjustments.\n   - Parse the DDL updates to understand table/column additions, changes.\n\n2. **Structural Alignment:**\n   - Apply all table structure changes from the DDL updates to the Snowflake stored procedure.\n   - Ensure all table references match those defined in the DDL updates.\n    - Add business logic from the Oracle procedure that are related to the Snowflake DDL updates to the Snowflake procedure.\n   - Add logic for handling any new columns or remove logic for deprecated columns.\n   - Do not make any table, column name changes that are present in the existing Snowflake procedure. Add only new tables and columns that are present in the DDL updates file\n\n3. **Data Type Reconciliation:**\n   - Convert Oracle-specific data types to their proper Snowflake equivalents.\n   - Add explicit type casting where necessary to maintain logical equivalence.\n   - Adjust numeric precision and scale for calculations to ensure consistent results.\n   - Ensure date/time handling remains functionally identical between versions.\n\n4. **Logic Preservation:**\n   - Maintain the same business logic as the Oracle procedure.\n   - Update conditional logic to reflect structural changes while preserving operational intent.\n   - Ensure transaction boundaries and error handling are appropriately translated.\n   - Verify that loops, cursors, and temporary data structures are properly converted.\n\n5. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Apply Snowflake best practices without compromising functional equivalence.\n   - Use appropriate Snowflake-specific constructs for improved performance.\n   - Minimize unnecessary transformations and type conversions.\n   - Ensure query patterns are optimized for Snowflake's architecture.\n\n6. **Validation Checks:**\n   - Verify all table and column references in the updated procedure exist in the DDL updates.\n   - Confirm all business logic from the Oracle procedure related only to the DDL updates are added to the Snowflake procedure.\n \n7. **Formatting and Structure:**\n   - Use consistent indentation and spacing for readability.\n   - Add clear comments explaining complex logic, especially where significant changes were made.\n   - Organize code sections logically with appropriate headers.\n   - Ensure proper SQL and procedural language syntax for Snowflake.\n  \nNote:\n - Include the list items present in the previous agent as comments in the generated code give the comments in between the code where the procedure is required\nInput:\n*use previous agent output as input \n* Oracle script:\n```%1$s```\n* Existing Snowflake script and Snowflake DDL updates :\n```%2$s```",
