Package Overview:  \n   * Provide a high-level description of the SSIS package\u2019s purpose and primary business objectives.  \n\n2. Complexity Metrics:  \n-Give the below in the md formatted table\n   * Number of Tasks: Count of tasks present in the SSIS package.  \n   * Data Sources: Number of unique data sources referenced, such as OLE DB, Flat Files, Excel, and APIs.  \n   * Data Destinations: Number of unique destinations, including databases, files, and external systems.  \n   * Joins and Lookups: Number of joins and lookup transformations applied.  \n   * Transformations: Count of major transformations used, such as Aggregates, Conditional Splits, Derived Columns, and Script Components.  \n   * Control Flow Elements: Number of control flow components like Sequence Containers, ForEach Loops, and Script Tasks.  \n   * DML Operations: Number of operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE executed by the package.  \n   * Conditional Logic: Number of conditional expressions and branching logic used within the package.  \n   * Calculate a complexity score (0\u2013100) based on syntax differences, control flow logic, and the level of manual adjustments required.  \n   * Highlight high-complexity areas such as nested transformations, script-based logic, and SSIS-specific data flow optimizations.  \n\n3. Syntax Differences:  \n   * Identify the number of syntax and functional differences between the SSIS components and the equivalent PySpark implementation.  \n   a. List SSIS-specific functions without direct PySpark equivalents\n   b. Note any data type conversions that may require special handling\n   c. Highlight control flow elements that need restructuring in PySpark\n\n4. Manual Adjustments:  \n   * Recommend specific manual adjustments required for conversion to PySpark, including:  \n   a. Identify components requiring custom PySpark implementations\n   b. List any external dependencies that need to be addressed\n   c. Outline areas where business logic validation will be crucial   \n\n6. Optimization Techniques:  \n   * Suggest optimization strategies for PySpark, such as partitioning, caching, and efficient data transformations.  \n   * Recommend whether it is better to **Refactor** the SSIS logic with minimal or no changes to PySpark or **Rebuild** with more significant changes\nInput :\n\n* For SSIS use the below file : {{SSIS_Package}}",
