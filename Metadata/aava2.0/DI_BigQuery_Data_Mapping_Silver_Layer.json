After processing and generating the output, write the final result back to the same GitHub repository using the provided GitHub credentials {{Github_Details}}.  \nEnsure both read and write operations are performed securely using these credentials.  \n\nYou are tasked with creating a detailed data mapping for the Silver Layer in a Medallion architecture implementation on BigQuery. This mapping will incorporate necessary cleansing, validations, and business rules at the attribute level. Your work will be based on the Bronze Layer Physical Model, Silver Layer Physical Model, and previous agent's Data Quality recommendations.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n* Review the provided Bronze Layer Physical Model, Silver Layer Physical Model, and previous agent's Data Quality recommendations.\n* Create a detailed data mapping from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer for all Bronze Layer tables, including the error data table and audit table.\n* Define data validation rules for each attribute in the validation rule column (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, VALID FORMAT, etc.).\n* Identify any initial data cleansing steps required before loading into the Silver Layer.\n* Specify any required data type conversions to ensure compatibility with BigQuery Standard SQL data types (STRING, INT64, FLOAT64, NUMERIC, DATE, TIMESTAMP, BOOL, etc.).\n* Ensure all validations and transformation rules are compatible with BigQuery Standard SQL.\n* Include explanations for complex validation, cleansing, and business rules.\n* Provide recommendations for error handling, logging mechanisms, and exception tracking in BigQuery.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n1) Overview: Summary of the data mapping approach and key considerations.\n\n2) Data Mapping for the Silver Layer:  \nMap data fields from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer, ensuring traceability and consistency.  \nThe mapping output should be in tabular format with the following fields for each table and column:\n   * Target Layer: Silver  \n   * Target Table: Proper table name as per the Silver Layer DDL script  \n   * Target Field: Proper field name as per the Silver Layer DDL script  \n   * Source Layer: Bronze  \n   * Source Table: Proper table name as per the Bronze Layer DDL script  \n   * Source Field: Proper field name as per the Bronze Layer DDL script  \n   * Validation Rule: Required validation rules from the business rules or data quality report (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, VALID FORMAT, etc.)  \n   * Transformation Rule: Required transformation rules derived from business rules or data quality recommendations  \n\n**Guidelines:**\n* Ensure the Silver Layer includes Bronze Layer tables with all necessary cleansing, validations, and business rules.\n* Clearly document the outputs with sufficient detail to serve as a foundation for technical implementation in BigQuery.\n* If certain details are ambiguous or missing, infer them logically based on the available context and clearly state any assumptions.\n* Ensure to provide data mapping from Bronze to Silver Layer only.\n* Ensure compatibility with BigQuery Standard SQL syntax and functions.\n* Additionally, calculate and include the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output, explicitly mentioning the cost in USD.  \n  - Do not consider the API cost as input; compute or retrieve it dynamically.  \n  - Ensure the cost consumed by the API is reported as a precise floating-point value, without rounding or truncation, until the first non-zero digit appears.  \n  - If the API returns the same cost across multiple calls, fetch real-time cost data or validate the calculation method.  \n  - Ensure cost computation considers different agents and their unique execution parameters.\n\n**INPUTS:**\n* For Bronze Layer Physical Model DDL script, use the following input:  \n{{Model_Physical_Bronze_Layer}}\n\n* For Silver Layer Physical Model DDL script, use the following input:  \n{{Model_Physical_Silver_Layer}}\n\n",
