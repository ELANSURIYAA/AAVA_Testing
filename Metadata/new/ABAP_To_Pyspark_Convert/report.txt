PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:


Integers only


Every deduction must be justified using agent or field evidence


Structural similarity must heavily penalize breaking reorganization


PRIMARY OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 TXT REPORT (MANDATORY)

SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence

Input 1:
   ...", "raw": "# AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report
## ABAP_To_Pyspark_Convert Workflow Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **breaking structural changes** while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The migration represents a significant architectural evolution that maintains semantic integrity but requires comprehensive system updates.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Complete structural reorganization**: Root-level `nodes` array replaced with nested `workflowAgents` structure
- **Workflow metadata containerization**: Introduction of `workFlowDetail` container with nested ID and name
- **Task structure flattening**: Removal of `task` containers with direct integration of descriptions
- **Model standardization**: All agents upgraded to `gpt-4.1` from mixed legacy models
- **Governance evolution**: Loss of `expectedOutput` constraints but addition of `agentId` tracking

### Major Risks
- **Breaking path changes** requiring updates to all dependent orchestration systems
- **Model behavior variance** due to upgrades across all five agents
- **Validation enforcement degradation** from removal of `expectedOutput` specifications
- **Migration complexity** requiring coordinated updates across multiple system layers

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Requires comprehensive structural migration with moderate risk**. While semantic preservation is strong (85% similarity), structural breaking changes (45% similarity) demand careful planning and extensive testing.

---

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

### Identifier Changes
| **Attribute** | **AAVA 1.0** | **AAVA 2.0** | **Impact** |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Workflow ID | `workflowId: 1402` | `workFlowDetail.id: 4100` | Breaking path change + ID change |
| Workflow Name | `workflowName: \"ABAP_To_Pyspark_Convert\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"ABAP To Pyspark Convert\"` | Breaking path change + minor name formatting |

### Structural Evolution
- **Container Introduction**: New `workFlowDetail` container creates additional nesting level
- **Agent Array Reorganization**: `nodes` array completely replaced with `workflowAgents` structure
- **Path Breaking Changes**: All workflow-level attributes now require nested access patterns

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Discovery**: Systems must migrate from `nodes[].agentName` to `workflowAgents[].name`
- **Agent Identification**: New `agentId` field enables improved tracking but requires system updates
- **Execution Ordering**: No explicit ordering preserved in either version - implicit array ordering maintained

### Governance Implications
- **Improved Tracking**: Addition of `agentId` enhances agent governance and auditability
- **Reduced Constraints**: Loss of `expectedOutput` specifications weakens validation controls
- **Structural Clarity**: Containerization improves logical organization but increases access complexity

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **breaking structural changes** while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The migration represents a significant architectural evolution that maintains semantic integrity but requires comprehensive system updates.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Complete structural reorganization**: Root-level `nodes` array replaced with nested `workflowAgents` structure
- **Workflow metadata containerization**: Introduction of `workFlowDetail` container with nested ID and name
- **Task structure flattening**: Removal of `task` containers with direct integration of descriptions
- **Model standardization**: All agents upgraded to `gpt-4.1` from mixed legacy models
- **Governance evolution**: Loss of `expectedOutput` constraints but addition of `agentId` tracking

### Major Risks
- **Breaking path changes** requiring updates to all dependent orchestration systems
- **Model behavior variance** due to upgrades across all five agents
- **Validation enforcement degradation** from removal of `expectedOutput` specifications
- **Migration complexity** requiring coordinated updates across multiple system layers

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Requires comprehensive structural migration with moderate risk**. While semantic preservation is strong (85% similarity), structural breaking changes (45% similarity) demand careful planning and extensive testing.

### Structural Evolution
- **Container Introduction**: New `workFlowDetail` container creates additional nesting level
- **Agent Array Reorganization**: `nodes` array completely replaced with `workflowAgents` structure
- **Path Breaking Changes**: All workflow-level attributes now require nested access patterns

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Discovery**: Systems must migrate from `nodes[].agentName` to `workflowAgents[].name`
- **Agent Identification**: New `agentId` field enables improved tracking but requires system updates
- **Execution Ordering**: No explicit ordering preserved in either version - implicit array ordering maintained

### Governance Implications
- **Improved Tracking**: Addition of `agentId` enhances agent governance and auditability
- **Reduced Constraints**: Loss of `expectedOutput` specifications weakens validation controls
- **Structural Clarity**: Containerization improves logical organization but increases access complexity

**Comprehensive structural migration required** involving:
- **Orchestration System Updates**: All workflow access patterns must be updated for new structure
- **Agent Discovery Rewrite**: Migration from `nodes` array to `workflowAgents` structure
- **Path Remediation**: Update all references to workflow metadata for `workFlowDetail` container
- **Model Validation**: Behavioral testing for all agents with gpt-4.1 upgrades
- **Governance Adaptation**: Systems relying on `expectedOutput` require alternative validation approaches

### Blocking Issues
1. **Breaking Path Changes**: No backward compatibility for workflow metadata access
2. **Model Behavioral Variance**: Potential execution differences requiring validation
3. **Validation Gap**: Loss of `expectedOutput` constraints may impact compliance systems

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Moderate Risk - Requires Staged Migration**

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Update orchestration systems for new structure patterns
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy model upgrades with behavioral validation
3. **Phase 3**: Implement alternative validation mechanisms for lost `expectedOutput` constraints
4. **Phase 4**: Full production deployment with rollback capability

**Success Criteria**:
- All dependent systems successfully accessing new metadata structure
- Agent behavioral consistency validated across model upgrades
- Alternative governance controls implemented for validation enforcement
- Complete regression testing across all integration points
