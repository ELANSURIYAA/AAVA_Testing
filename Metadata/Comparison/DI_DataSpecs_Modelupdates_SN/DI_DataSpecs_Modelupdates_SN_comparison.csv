deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow with significant structural evolution. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more normalized schema with enhanced agent modeling but removes critical task specification details. The semantic alignment remains strong despite architectural changes.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN represents the same business process in both versions. Agent purposes and descriptions maintain semantic consistency.",3,6
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN renamed to DI Data Technical Specification SN (spaces added). Semantic meaning identical.",7,9
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN renamed to DI Delta Model Changes SN. Core functionality preserved.",30,17
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN renamed to DI Functional Test Cases SN. Purpose unchanged.",53,25
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: workflowId/workflowName flattened to workFlowDetail object with id/name properties.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents with enhanced agent modeling including agentId field.",4,8
deduction,structural_analysis,"Task object structure completely removed from AAVA 2.0. Task descriptions moved to agent-level description field.",8,9
deduction,structural_analysis,"expectedOutput field completely removed in AAVA 2.0, representing significant metadata loss for task specifications.",8,
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools array renamed to toolReferences with different structure (empty arrays vs string references).",9,9
deduction,field_change,"workflowId (1594) changed to workFlowDetail.id (2147). Different workflow instance.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"workflowName changed to workFlowDetail.name with identical value but different casing pattern.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"agentName changed to name field within agent objects. Naming convention updated.",7,10
deduction,field_change,"model field changed to modelDeploymentName with version update (gpt-4 to gpt-4.1).",8,11
deduction,type_change,"tools field changed from string array to toolReferences empty array, indicating structural change in tool management.",9,33
deduction,constraint_change,"agentId field added as new identifier in AAVA 2.0 agents, enhancing referential integrity.",9,9
deduction,missing_metadata,"expectedOutput field completely removed in AAVA 2.0, losing critical task specification metadata across all agents.",15,
deduction,missing_metadata,"task object structure removed, consolidating task.description into agent.description but losing task.expectedOutput.",8,
deduction,governance_issue,"Loss of expectedOutput metadata reduces specification completeness and may impact downstream systems expecting detailed output formats.",15,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references changed from concrete string arrays to empty toolReferences arrays, potentially breaking tool dependency tracking.",9,33
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent structure and proper field typing.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_1.0,"All agent objects follow consistent schema with required fields present.",7,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has empty toolReferences arrays across all agents.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava_2.0,"Consistent agent schema but missing expectedOutput specifications may impact completeness.",9,
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major schema evolution with breaking changes in structure and field organization.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Removal of expectedOutput field may break downstream systems expecting detailed task output specifications.",15,
deduction,risk,"Tool reference structure changes may impact tool dependency resolution and workflow execution.",9,33
deduction,risk,"Workflow ID change (1594 to 2147) indicates different workflow instances which may affect system integration.",2,3
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about actual tool dependencies compared to explicit tool names in AAVA 1.0.",9,33
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform evolution alongside metadata schema changes.",8,11
deduction,general_finding,"Agent naming convention changed from underscore_separated to space separated format improving readability.",7,10
