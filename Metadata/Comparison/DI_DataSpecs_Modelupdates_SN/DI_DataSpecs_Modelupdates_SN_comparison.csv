deduction,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow concept remains intact but with enhanced organization and naming conventions. Major structural changes include workflow metadata reorganization and agent configuration refinements.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent the same DI DataSpecs Modelupdates workflow with identical agent purposes and functionality. The core business logic for technical specification generation, delta model changes, and functional test cases remains semantically equivalent.",2,2
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization: workflow metadata moved from flat properties to nested workFlowDetail object, nodes renamed to workflowAgents, and agent configuration structure modified with new property names.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root property workflowId (1594) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2147) with different ID value indicating new workflow instance.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root property workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with consistent naming pattern.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Array property nodes renamed to workflowAgents maintaining same structural purpose.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent property agentName renamed to name in AAVA 2.0 agent configuration.",7,8
deduction,field_change,"Agent property model renamed to modelDeploymentName with value change from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",8,9
deduction,type_change,"Tools property changed from string array to toolReferences array structure.",9,11
deduction,structural_change,"Task object structure removed in AAVA 2.0, with description moved to direct agent property.",10,10
deduction,constraint_change,"Agent ID constraint added in AAVA 2.0 with agentId property (3885, 3474, 3545) not present in AAVA 1.0.",7,8
deduction,missing_metadata,"Expected output specifications removed from AAVA 2.0 agent configuration, reducing metadata completeness.",11,
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool reference mechanism changed from direct string arrays to empty toolReferences arrays, potentially impacting tool governance.",9,11
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 represents a major version evolution with breaking changes to workflow and agent metadata structure.",1,1
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid with enhanced structure and consistent internal organization.",1,
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may require significant updates to dependent systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Tool reference mechanism changes could impact downstream tool integration and workflow execution.",9,11
deduction,ambiguity,"Different workflow IDs (1594 vs 2147) suggest these may represent different workflow instances rather than version evolution.",2,3
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 indicates platform enhancement across all agents.",8,9
deduction,general_finding,"Agent naming convention improved with removal of underscores in AAVA 2.0 (e.g., DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN to DI Data Technical Specification SN).",7,8
deduction,general_finding,"Workflow organization enhanced with nested workFlowDetail structure providing better metadata encapsulation.",2,2
