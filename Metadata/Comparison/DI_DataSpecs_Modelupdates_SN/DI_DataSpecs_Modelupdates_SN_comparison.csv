deduction,executive_summary,"The two metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and minor semantic preservation. AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical organization and enhanced metadata while maintaining core business logic.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: both versions define a 3-agent data integration pipeline for technical specifications, model changes, and test cases. Business meaning remains consistent.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization detected. AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure while AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object and renames key collections.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowId (1594) renamed to workFlowDetail.id (2147). Semantic meaning preserved but structural location changed.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Field workflowName renamed to workFlowDetail.name with formatting change from DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN to DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN.",3,4
deduction,field_change,"Collection nodes renamed to workflowAgents. Semantic meaning preserved but naming convention updated.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent field agentName renamed to name. Semantic meaning preserved.",6,8
deduction,field_change,"Field model renamed to modelDeploymentName with value upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1.",7,9
deduction,type_change,"Tools field changed from array of strings to toolReferences array of objects. All tool references removed in AAVA 2.0.",8,10
deduction,schema_evolution,"AAVA 2.0 introduces agentId field (3885, 3474, 3545) providing unique identifiers for agents not present in AAVA 1.0.",6,7
deduction,governance_issue,"Tool references completely removed in AAVA 2.0. DI_Github_File_Writer_Z tool from AAVA 1.0 not preserved.",8,10
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 JSON is syntactically valid with consistent internal structure and proper field relationships.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 JSON is syntactically valid but has empty toolReferences arrays which may indicate incomplete migration.",1,10
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may break existing parsers expecting flat workflowId/workflowName structure.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Removal of tool references may impact downstream systems expecting tool configuration data.",8,10
deduction,ambiguity,"Unclear if empty toolReferences arrays are intentional design or incomplete data migration.",10,10
deduction,general_finding,"Task descriptions remain identical across versions indicating preserved functional requirements.",9,10
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 suggests platform evolution.",7,9
deduction,general_finding,"Introduction of agentId suggests move toward more structured agent management.",6,7
