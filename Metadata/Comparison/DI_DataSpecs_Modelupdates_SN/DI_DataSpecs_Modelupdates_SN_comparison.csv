deductions,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The metadata shows a transition from a flat workflow structure to a more sophisticated nested architecture with enhanced agent modeling. Key changes include workflow detail encapsulation, agent restructuring, and model deployment specifications. While semantic alignment remains strong, structural changes introduce moderate compatibility risks.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept preserved: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow maintains identical business purpose across versions. Agent functionality semantically equivalent despite structural changes.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN maintains identical core description and task requirements in both versions, ensuring semantic consistency.",8,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN agent preserves complete semantic meaning with identical description and expected outputs across versions.",35,35
deductions,semantic_analysis,"DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN agent shows full semantic preservation with matching descriptions and task requirements.",62,62
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with workflowId/workflowName, AAVA 2.0 introduces nested workFlowDetail object.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Node-to-Agent transformation: 'nodes' array renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced metadata structure including agentId and modelDeploymentName.",4,6
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent naming evolution: agentName becomes name, introducing agentId as new identifier field.",8,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model specification enhancement: 'model' field replaced with 'modelDeploymentName' providing more specific deployment context.",9,9
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools architecture change: 'tools' array replaced with 'toolReferences' array, indicating shift from direct tool specification to reference-based approach.",10,89
deductions,field_change,"workflowId (1594) restructured into workFlowDetail.id (2147) - semantic preservation with structural enhancement.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"workflowName restructured into workFlowDetail.name with identical semantic value but nested organization.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"nodes array renamed to workflowAgents - functional equivalence maintained with structural evolution.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"agentName field renamed to name within agent objects - semantic preservation with simplified naming.",8,9
deductions,type_change,"model field changed from string value 'gpt-4' to modelDeploymentName 'gpt-4.1' - indicates version upgrade and deployment specification enhancement.",9,10
deductions,constraint_change,"New agentId field introduced as integer identifier (3885, 3474, 3545) - adds unique identification constraint not present in AAVA 1.0.",0,8
deductions,structural_reorganization,"Tools specification architecture completely restructured: AAVA 1.0 uses direct tool name arrays, AAVA 2.0 uses empty toolReferences arrays indicating architectural shift.",10,89
deductions,governance_issue,"Model version upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1 across all agents may impact reproducibility and backward compatibility of existing workflows.",9,10
deductions,governance_issue,"Introduction of agentId creates new dependency for agent identification that may require system-wide updates for referential integrity.",0,8
deductions,risk,"Structural reorganization from flat to nested workflow detail may break existing parsers and downstream systems expecting AAVA 1.0 format.",2,2

deductions,schema_evolution,"Introduction of agentId and modelDeploymentName fields indicates maturation toward production-ready metadata specification.",8,8
deductions,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about tool specification approach - unclear if tools are specified elsewhere or deprecated.",10,89
