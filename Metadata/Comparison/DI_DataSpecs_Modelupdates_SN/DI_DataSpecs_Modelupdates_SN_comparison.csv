deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 while preserving core semantic meaning. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates) but introduces enhanced metadata organization and modernized field structures. Key changes include workflow metadata restructuring, agent configuration evolution, and improved data organization patterns.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow purpose remains identical: DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow for data integration specifications and model updates. All three agents maintain equivalent business functionality despite structural changes.",2,3
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN preserves identical task description and output requirements across both versions, ensuring semantic consistency.",8,13
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN maintains same core functionality for model evolution analysis and DDL generation with identical business logic.",52,35
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN retains same test case generation requirements and markdown output format specifications.",102,57
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure, representing architectural modernization.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification evolved from simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' fields to nested 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent configuration restructured: AAVA 1.0 'nodes' array with 'agentName' becomes AAVA 2.0 'workflowAgents' array with 'agentId' and 'name' fields.",7,13
deductions,structural_analysis,"Model specification evolution: 'model' field in AAVA 1.0 becomes 'modelDeploymentName' in AAVA 2.0, indicating deployment-aware architecture.",9,15
deductions,structural_analysis,"Tools configuration simplified: AAVA 1.0 'tools' array becomes AAVA 2.0 'toolReferences' array, suggesting reference-based tool management.",10,79
deductions,field_change,"Workflow ID field: 'workflowId: 1594' in AAVA 1.0 becomes 'id: 2147' in nested workFlowDetail object in AAVA 2.0.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name field: 'workflowName' becomes 'name' within workFlowDetail structure, with value evolution from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore to space conversion).",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent identification: 'agentName' field replaced by combination of 'agentId' (new numeric identifier) and 'name' field in AAVA 2.0.",8,14
deductions,field_change,"Model specification: 'model: gpt-4' becomes 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1', indicating version upgrade and deployment-specific naming.",9,15
deductions,field_change,"Tools configuration: 'tools: [DI_Github_File_Writer_Z]' becomes 'toolReferences: []', showing architectural shift from direct tool specification to reference-based approach.",10,79
deductions,type_change,"Workflow ID type consistency maintained (numeric) but value changed from 1594 to 2147, indicating different workflow instance or version.",2,3
deductions,constraint_change,"Agent identification constraints: AAVA 1.0 relies on string-based agentName while AAVA 2.0 introduces numeric agentId as primary identifier with name as secondary.",8,14
deductions,missing_metadata,"Task structure field missing: AAVA 1.0 'task' object with 'description' and 'expectedOutput' becomes flattened 'description' field in AAVA 2.0, losing explicit output specification structure.",11,16
deductions,missing_metadata,"Tool specification degradation: AAVA 1.0 explicitly lists 'DI_Github_File_Writer_Z' tool while AAVA 2.0 shows empty 'toolReferences' array, indicating potential configuration loss.",10,79
deductions,governance_issue,"Expected output specifications missing in AAVA 2.0: Loss of structured 'expectedOutput' field reduces metadata governance and validation capabilities.",45,
deductions,governance_issue,"Tool reference governance: Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 may indicate incomplete migration or architectural change requiring validation.",10,79
deductions,schema_evolution,"Schema version evolution: AAVA 2.0 represents major architectural upgrade with improved hierarchy and metadata organization while maintaining backward semantic compatibility.",1,1
deductions,schema_evolution,"Naming convention modernization: Field names evolved from snake_case (workflowId, agentName) to camelCase (workFlowDetail, agentId) following modern JSON conventions.",2,2
deductions,ambiguity,"Model version ambiguity: 'gpt-4' vs 'gpt-4.1' may represent different model capabilities affecting agent behavior and output quality.",9,15
deductions,ambiguity,"Tool reference interpretation: Empty toolReferences arrays could indicate either architectural change or incomplete configuration requiring clarification.",10,79
deductions,risk,"Backward compatibility risk: Structural changes from flat nodes array to hierarchical workflowAgents may break existing parsers and integration systems.",7,13
deductions,risk,"Tool configuration risk: Missing tool specifications in AAVA 2.0 may impact agent execution capabilities and workflow functionality.",10,79
deductions,risk,"Metadata governance risk: Loss of explicit expectedOutput structure may reduce validation and quality assurance capabilities.",45,
deductions,general_finding,"Content preservation: All agent task descriptions and core functionality specifications preserved exactly between versions, ensuring business continuity.",11,16
deductions,general_finding,"Architectural modernization: AAVA 2.0 demonstrates clear evolution toward more structured, hierarchical metadata organization suitable for enterprise-scale deployment.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Agent count consistency: Both versions maintain exactly three agents (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN, DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN, DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN) with identical core purposes.",7,13
