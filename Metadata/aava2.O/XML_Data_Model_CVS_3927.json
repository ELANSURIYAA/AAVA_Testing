This process is essential for **data architecture, validation, and reporting**.  \n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n1. **Parse the XML file** to extract all relevant data structures.  \n2. **Identify and categorize entities**:  \n   - The main entity represents the primary business domain.  \n   - Any **nested objects** or **grouped attributes** should be treated as **separate entities** \n   - The attributes present in the sub-entity or nested entity must also be included as attributes in the main entity.\n   - For the main entity's attributes, do not consider the sub-entity's corresponding attributes as an attribute for the main entity. \n3. **For each entity, list the attributes** along with their descriptions.  \n4. **Maintain relationships**:  \n   - If an entity contains another entity\u2019s attributes, establish a **relationship** between them.  \n   - Identify **primary keys** and **foreign keys** explicitly.  \n5. **Capture attribute details**:  \n   - **Data Characteristics**: Identify data type, uniqueness, required/optional status, and relationships.  \n   - **Domain**: Define the range of possible values or constraints.  \n   - **Cardinality**: Assess uniqueness (e.g., high or low cardinality).  \n   - **Data Distribution**: Analyze attribute distributions (mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis).  \n   - **Missing Values**: Identify missing values and recommend handling strategies (e.g., imputation, exclusion).  \n   - **Outliers**: Detect anomalies and suggest handling approaches.  \n6. **Ensure clarity**: Do not assume additional attributes beyond the given XML structure.  \n7. **Output the model in a structured text format** (not XML), using **numbered bullet points** for readability.  \n\n### **Additional Guidelines:**  \n- **Ensure each attribute is correctly mapped** to the appropriate entity.  \n- **ID attributes** should only be included if they serve a business purpose beyond technical identification.  \n\n#### **Input XML File:**  \nUse the below file as input:  \n```%1$s``` ",

Define transformation rules where discrepancies exist.\n- **Column Name Mapping**: Identify cases where column names differ and provide a corresponding mapping.\n- **Overall Schema Alignment**: Ensure that the Current tables are correctly mapped to the Existing tables in BigQuery.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. **Analyze the provided DDL scripts**:\n   - Review the Current DDL Script extracted from XML.\n   - Review the Existing DDL Script from BigQuery.\n2. **Create a detailed mapping between the Current and Existing DDL structures**:\n   - Map all the source tables to the respective existing target tables \n   - Identify matching tables and columns.\n   - Map data types between the two scripts and specify transformations if needed.\n   - Map domain values and define transformation rules for mismatches.\n   - Identify and document column name differences and their corresponding mappings.\n   - Create a detailed mapping for each input tables with there respective column seperately \n   - While data mapping for Main Entity do not include columns which are presented in the nested entity or sub entities\n3.
