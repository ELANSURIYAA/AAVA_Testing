          "description": "You need to take the input from the Github Repo using the Github Reader tool, once generated the output then write the output in the github repo with the following github credentials {{Github_Details}} for both read and write action  \n\nYou are tasked with analyzing the reporting requirements to identify key components necessary for defining the conceptual data model for BigQuery. This process is essential for creating a solid foundation for our data architecture and reporting system that leverages BigQuery's strengths in handling large-scale analytical workloads.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.Review all available documentation related to reporting requirements.\n2.Identify the primary business domain(s) covered by the reports.\n3.List all data entities mentioned or implied in the requirements that will become BigQuery tables.\n4.For each entity, enumerate the relevant attributes. Give a business name to the attributes.\n5.Include a business description for each attribute.\n6.Do not include any ID attributes.\n7.Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) mentioned in the requirements.\n8.Organize the collected information into a structured format.\n9.Create a visual representation of the conceptual data model (e.g., entity-relationship diagram). Clearly need to be mention one table is connected to another table by which key field.\n10.Validate the model against the original requirements to ensure completeness.\n11.Identify and list all data elements or fields that are referenced across multiple reports within the given requirements.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n1.Domain Overview\n2.List of Entity Name with a description\n3.List of Attributes for each Entity with a description for each attribute\n4.KPI List\n5.Conceptual Data Model Diagram in tabular form by one table is having a relationship with other table by which key field\n6.Common Data Elements in Report Requirements\n\nGuidelines:\n-Assume the report requirements is provided unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n-Use the information exactly as provided in the report requirements without assuming or introducing new elements or requirements.\n-If certain details in the report requirements are ambiguous or missing, clearly state only what can be inferred based on the available input without adding unnecessary disclaimers.\n-Do not include data type along with the attributes.\n-Do not include ID attributes.\n-Don't give output in the JSON format, give output in the normal text format.\n-In the output add all the necessary Number bullet marks.\n\nInputs:\nFor input report requirement use the below file:\n{{Report_Requirement_File}}",

After processing and generating the output, write the final result back to the same GitHub repository using the GitHub Writer tool and the provided GitHub credentials {{Github_Details}}.  \nEnsure both read and write operations are performed securely using these credentials.\n\nYou are responsible for identifying and specifying Data Expectations, Constraints, and Business Rules related to the reporting requirements for BigQuery implementation. These elements will help ensure the data model aligns with business needs, regulatory compliance, and BigQuery's capabilities and best practices.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.Extract Data Expectations from the reporting requirements.\n2.Identify and document Constraints affecting the data model in BigQuery context.\n3.Define Business Rules that govern the data structure and relationships.\n4.Ensure alignment with reporting requirements and business objectives.\n5.Consider BigQuery-specific constraint mechanisms and validation approaches.\n6.Don't give output in the JSON format, give output in the normal text format.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n1.Data Expectations \u2013 Define expectations regarding data completeness, accuracy, format, and consistency.\n2.Constraints \u2013 Identify constraints such as mandatory fields, uniqueness, data type limitations, dependencies, and referential integrity (note BigQuery's constraint support).\n3.Business Rules \u2013 Define operational rules affecting data processing, reporting logic, and transformation guidelines.\n\nGuidelines:\n-Ensure Data Expectations, Constraints, and Business Rules strictly align with the reporting requirements.\n-Do not introduce new elements that are not present in the given requirements.\n-Provide precise definitions to avoid ambiguity.\n-In the output add all the necessary Number bullet marks.\n-Note that BigQuery supports informational constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY) that are not enforced but used by query optimizer.\n-Consider data validation through SQL logic, stored procedures, or data quality checks rather than relying solely on database constraints.\n\nInputs:\nFor input report requirement use the below file:\n{{Report_Requirement_File}}",
