          "description": "You are tasked with creating a detailed logical data model for a medallion architecture Silver Layer. This model will serve as the blueprint for implementing a scalable and efficient data platform. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a comprehensive and well-structured output.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. Review and analyze the provided Data Constraints.\n2. Design the Silver layer:\n   a. Mirror the Bronze data structure exactly but remove primary and foreign key fields in the output.\n   b. Include all fields from the Bronze data structure without primary key and foreign key fields; just remove those fields and keep the rest.\n   c. Create a consistent naming convention for tables with the first 3 characters in the table name as 'Si_'.\n   d. Include the data structure to hold both error data from data quality checks and validation and process audit data from pipeline execution.\n   e. Implement data type standardization.  \n   f. Give brief descriptions for all the columns.\n   g. Don't include primary key, foreign key, unique identifiers, and ID fields.\n3. Document relationships between tables across all layers.\n4. Provide rationale for key design decisions and any assumptions made.\n5. Create a visual representation of the conceptual data model (e.g., entity-relationship diagram). Clearly need to be mention one table is connected to another table by which key field \n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n1. Silver Layer Logica Model\n   - Table Name with description\n   - Column Name with description\n   - Data Type\n   - Include both Error Data Table and Audit Table in the Silver layer\n2. Conceptual Data Model Diagram in tabular form by one tale is having a relationship with other table by which key field\n\nGuidelines:\n* Assume source data structure, and sample data are provided unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n* Use the information exactly as provided without introducing new elements or assumptions.\n* If certain details in the inputs are ambiguous or missing, clearly state what can be inferred based on the available input without adding unnecessary disclaimers.\n\nInputs:\n* For Model Conceptual, Data Constraints and Fabric Model Logical Bronze Layer use the below file as input :\n ```%1$s```",

          "description": "You need to translate the provided logical data model into a comprehensive physical data model with id fields for the Silver layer of the Medallion architecture. Follow these detailed instructions to complete the task:\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Analyze the provided logical data model to understand the data entities, relationships, and attributes. And also analyze the provided Physical Model DDL script for Bronze layer Because i want all the columns and tables are mentioned in the Bronze layer physical DDL, add extra error data table.\n2. Design tables for the Silver layer to store cleansed and conformed data, ensuring compatibility with Spark SQL.\n3. Include an error data table to store details of errors encountered during data validation in both Silver and Gold layers\n4. For each table in the physical data model:\n    - Give DDL script if table not exists for all the columns of the Bronze tables with id fields also. In the Logical model, if id fields are missing, add them in the Physical model DDL script.\n    - Define appropriate data types for each column, considering Microsoft Fabric and PySpark compatibility.\n    - Determine appropriate partitioning strategies based on business domain.\n    - Design necessary indexes to optimize query performance.\n    - Do not include foreign keys, primary keys, or other constraints that are incompatible with Spark SQL. Even if the input contains primary and foreign keys, do not include \n them in the output DDL script. Instead, provide only the field name with its datatype.\n    - The DDL script must have all the columns present in the Bronze layer, Please ensure this one\n5. Include metadata columns for each table, such as load_date, update_date, and source_system.\n6. Specify appropriate storage formats (e.g., Delta Lake) for each table.\n7. Define data retention policies for the Silver layer.\n8. Create the Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts for each table, ensuring compatibility with Microsoft Fabric and PySpark.\n9. Include an audit table in both Silver and Gold layers to store details of pipeline executions, including start and end times, status, and error messages if any.\n10. Document any assumptions or design decisions made during the process.\n11. In the attached Knowledge Base file, ensure that any limitations of Microsoft Fabric SparkSQL are identified and not included in the final output.\n12. Create a visual representation of the conceptual data model (e.g., entity-relationship diagram). Clearly need to be mention one table is connected to another table by which key field \n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n1. Provide the physical data model and DDL scripts in the following structure:\nSilver Layer :\n- DDL scripts\n- Error Data Table DDL script\n- Audit Table DDL script \n- Update DDL script\n2. Data Retention Policies\n- Retention periods for the Silver layer\n- Archiving strategies\n3. Conceptual Data Model Diagram in tabular form by one tale is having a relationship with other table by which key field\n\nGUIDELINES:\n* Ensure all scripts are syntactically correct and adhere to SQL standards for Microsoft Fabric.\n* Do not include foreign key, primary key, or other constraints that are incompatible with Spark SQL.\n* Incorporate Fabric-specific features into the DDL scripts.\n* Clearly document and organize the output for easy implementation in Microsoft Fabric.\n* Ensure the DDL scripts for the Silver layer are separated into distinct sections or files and are compatible with Microsoft Fabric.\n* Ensure the DDL scripts match all the constraints and requirements provided.\n* The DDL scripts should include code for the physical model and update scripts for data model changes.\n* Use Table if not exists method\n*Additionally, calculate and include the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output, explicitly mentioning the cost in USD. Don't consider the API cost as input and retrieve the cost of this API. \n*Ensure the cost consumed by the API is reported as a precise floating-point value, without rounding or truncation, until the first non-zero digit appears.\n*If the API returns the same cost across multiple calls, fetch real-time cost data or validate the calculation method.\n*Ensure that cost computation considers different agents and their unique execution parameters.\n\nINPUTS:\n* For input Bronze layer physical DDL script use the this file: ```%2$s```",
