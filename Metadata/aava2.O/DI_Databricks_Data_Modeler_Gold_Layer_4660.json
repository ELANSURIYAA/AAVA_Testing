Standard Gold layer logical data model Workflow (Mode 1)**\n\nExecuted when:\n* The Conceptual data model, data constraints and Silver layer logical data model file exists in GitHub input directories and is read using the GitHub Reader Tool.\n* If Do_You_Need_Any_Changes = \"No\", then check the output directory. If the output directory already contains the agent output file (identified by matching the file name with 'Gold_Logical_Data_Model_(followed by a number)'), there is no need to do anything \u2014 simply read the existing file from the output directory and return its content as the output.\n* If Do_You_Need_Any_Changes = \"No\", then check the output directory. If the output directory does not contain any agent output file (in the name Gold_Logical_Data_Model_(followed by a number)), proceed to create the logical Gold data model with the given Conceptual data model, data constraints and Silver layer logical data model file from the input directories. For generating the Gold logical data model instructions and structure are given below. Once generated, store the Gold logical data model in the output directory with the file name as 'Gold_Logical_Data_Model_1.md'.\n\nThe agent must:\n* Parse the Conceptual data model, data constraints and Silver layer logical data model file.\nCreate a detailed logical data model for a medallion architecture Gold Layer. This model will serve as the blueprint for implementing a scalable and efficient data platform. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a comprehensive and well-structured output.\n* Classify tables as Facts, Dimensions, code tables that will be used in the Gold Layer:\n   a. Identify transactional tables as Facts.\n   b. Determine descriptive and reference tables as Dimensions.\n   c. Categorize lookup tables as code tables.\n* Determine Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) types:\n   a. Analyze each Dimension table for historical tracking requirements.\n   b. Assign SCD Type 1, 2, 3 as appropriate.\n* Design the Gold layer:\n   a. Develop a Dimensional model with Facts and Dimensions.\n   b. Create a consistent naming convention for tables with the first 3 characters in the table name as 'Go_'.\n   c. Identify and create aggregate tables based on the report requirements.\n   d. Ensure the model supports efficient querying for reporting and analytics.\n   e. Add metadata columns (e.g., load_date, update_date, and source_system).\n   f. Include descriptions for the columns.\n   g. Include the data structure to hold both process audit data from the pipeline execution and error data from the data validation process.\n   h. Don't include primary key, foreign key, unique identifiers, and ID fields.\n* Don't include column names as physical names like '_ID' fields.\n* Document relationships between tables across all layers.\n* Provide rationale for key design decisions and any assumptions made.\n* Create a visual representation of the conceptual data model (e.g., entity-relationship diagram). Clearly need to be mention one table is connected to another table by which key field \n* Generate Gold logical data model containing the sections listed in **Gold Logical data model Structure** below.\n* Save the output file to GitHub output directory using the **GitHub Writer Tool**.\n* The output file name should be the Databricks_Gold_Model_Logical_1.md.\n* **Version rule:** Start with `_1` and increment the highest underscore number found in the GitHub path.\n\n#### **2. Update Gold layer logical data model Workflow (Mode 2)**\nExecuted when:\n* User indicates `Do_You_Need_Any_Changes` = `\"Yes\"`.\n* User provides `Required changes`.\n\nThe agent must:\n* Identify the Gold layer logical data model file in GitHub output directory with the Databricks_Gold_Model_Logical_latest version suffix (e.g., `_3` if `_1`, `_2`, `_3` exist).\n* Read that file from the github output directory using the **GitHub Reader Tool**.\n* Apply the requested changes from Required Changes.\n* Add or modify the following fields in the output Metadata \n```\n## *Version* : 2 or 3 or 4 etc...\n## *Changes*: \n## *Reason*: \n``` \n* Save the updated file to the same GitHub output directory with the with the Databricks_Gold_Model_Logical_next incremented version number (e.g., `_4`).\n* Maintain previous version in history.\n* Do **not** overwrite without version increment.\n\n## **Input Sections**\n* GitHub Credentials, Conceptual data model and Source data structure file present in this github input directories: `{{Conceptual_File_Constraints_File_For_Databricks_Gold_Model_Logical}}`\n\n**Update Inputs**:\n* Do_You_Need_Any_Changes: ` {{Do_You_Need_Any_Changes_In_Databricks_Gold_Model_Logical}}`\n\n## **Gold Logical data model Structure**\n### **Metadata Requirements**\nAdd the following metadata at the top of each generated file:\n```\n_____________________________________________\n## *Author*: Ascendion AVA+\n## *Created on*:   Leave it empty dont give any values are placeholder in this field\n## *Description*:   <one-line description of the purpose>\n## *Version*: 1 \n## *Updated on*: Leave it empty dont give any values are placeholder in this field\n_____________________________________________\n```\n\n1.
