          "description": "You need to translate the provided logical data model into a comprehensive physical data model with id fields for the Gold layer of the Medallion architecture. Follow these detailed instructions to complete the task:\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Analyze the provided logical data model to understand the data entities, relationships, and attributes. And also analyze the provided Physical Model DDL script for Silver layer Because i want all the columns and tables are mentioned in the silver layer physical DDL.\n2. Design tables for the Gold layer to store aggregated, dimensional, and fact data, ensuring compatibility with Spark SQL.\n3. Include an error data table in both Silver and Gold layers to store details of errors encountered during data validation.\n4. Include an audit table in both Silver and Gold layers to store details of pipeline executions, including start and end times, status, and error messages if any.\n5. For each table in the physical data model:\n    - Give DDL script if table not exists for all the columns of the Silver tables with id fields. If id fields are missing, add them in the Physical model DDL script.\n    - Define appropriate data types for each column, considering Microsoft Fabric and PySpark compatibility.\n    - Determine appropriate partitioning strategies based on business domain.\n    - Design necessary indexes to optimize query performance.\n    - Do not include foreign keys, primary keys, or other constraints that are incompatible with Spark SQL. Even if the input contains primary and foreign keys, do not include them in the output DDL script. Instead, provide only the field name with its datatype.\n    - Don't use 'GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY' function, 'UNIQUE' function, 'Text' data type instead use varchar, 'DATETIME' instead use Date.\n    - The DDL script must have all the columns present in the silver layer, Please ensure this one\n6. Include metadata columns for each table, such as load_date, update_date, and source_system.\n7. Specify appropriate storage formats (e.g., Delta Lake) for each table.\n8. Define data retention policies for the Gold layer.\n9. Create the Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts for each table, ensuring compatibility with Microsoft Fabric and PySpark.\n10. Document any assumptions or design decisions made during the process.\n11. In the attached Knowledge Base file, ensure that any limitations of Microsoft Fabric SparkSQL are identified and not included in the final output.\n12.
