Follow these instructions to accomplish the task:\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Parse the input DDL statement to extract table and column information.\n2. Identify the data types, constraints, and relationships defined in the DDL.\n3. For each column, analyze the sample data provided and determine appropriate data quality checks based on its characteristics \n   a. For numeric columns: range checks, null checks, precision checks\n   b. For string columns: length checks, pattern matching, allowed character sets\n   c. For date/time columns: format validation, range checks\n   d. For foreign key columns: referential integrity checks\n4. Consider table-level checks, such as uniqueness constraints and row count validations.\n5. Read the provides business rules to include additional data validation rules.\n7. Generate a detailed list of recommendations, providing the rationale for each check including the data quality checks based on the business rules file\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- Recommended Data Quality Checks:\n  1. [Check Name]: [Description]\n     - Rationale: [Explanation]\n     - SQL Example: [Sample SQL query for the check]\n* Include the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output.\n* Ensure the cost consumed by the API is reported as a floating-point value with currency explicitly mentioned as USD (e.g., apiCost: actual cost ).\n\nINPUT :\n* For Data Constraints and Sample data take the below files as input : \n```%1$s```\n* For Fabric Model Physical Bronze Layer DDL script use this file : ```%2$s```\n\n",

          "description": "You are tasked with creating a detailed data mapping for the Silver Layer in a Medallion architecture implementation in Microsoft Fabric. This mapping will incorporate necessary cleansing, validations, and business rules at the attribute level. Your work will be based on the Bronze layer Physical Model, Silver layer Physical model and previous agent's Data quality recommendations\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n* Review the provided Bronze layer Physical Model, Silver layer Physical model and previous agent's Data quality recommendations\n* Create a detailed data mapping from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer for all Bronze layer tables, error data table, and audit table:\n* Define data validation rules for each attribute in the validation rule column (eg. Not null, Unique, Valid format etc..).\n* Identify any initial data cleansing steps.\n* Specify data type conversions if necessary.\n* Ensure all validations and rules are compatible with PySpark and Microsoft Fabric.\n* Include explanations for complex validation, cleansing, and business rules.\n* Provide recommendations for error handling and logging mechanisms.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n1) Overview: Summary of the data mapping approach and key considerations.\n2) Data Mapping for the Silver Layer: Map data fields from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer, ensuring traceability and consistency. The mapping output should be in the Tabular format with the following fields for each table and column:\n   * Target Layer: Silver  \n   * Target Table: Proper table name as per the Silver Layer DDL script  \n   * Target Field: Proper field name as per the Silver Layer DDL script  \n   * Source Layer: Bronze  \n   * Source Table: Proper table name as per the Bronze Layer DDL script  \n   * Source Field: Proper field name as per the Bronze Layer DDL script  \n   * Validation Rule: Required validation rules from the report requirement file (eg. Not null, Unique, Valid format etc..)\n   * Transformation Rule: Required transformation rules from the report requirement file  \n\nGuidelines:\n* Ensure the Silver layer having Bronze layer tables with necessary cleansing, validations, and business rules.\n* Clearly document the outputs with enough granularity to serve as a foundation for technical implementation.\n* If certain details are ambiguous or missing, infer them logically based on the available context and clearly state your assumptions.\n* Ensure to provide data mapping for Bronze to Silver Layer only.\n* Ensure compatibility with Microsoft Fabric Spark SQL.\n*Additionally, calculate and include the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output, explicitly mentioning the cost in USD. Don't consider the API cost as input and retrieve the cost of this API. \n*Ensure the cost consumed by the API is reported as a precise floating-point value, without rounding or truncation, until the first non-zero digit appears.\n*If the API returns the same cost across multiple calls, fetch real-time cost data or validate the calculation method.\n*Ensure that cost computation considers different agents and their unique execution parameters.\n\nInputs:\n* For Bronze layer Physical Model DDL script use this file as input : ```%2$s```\n* For Silver layer Physical Model DDL script use this file as input : ```%3$s```\n* Also take input from previous Fabric DQ recommender Agent\u2019s output as input.",
