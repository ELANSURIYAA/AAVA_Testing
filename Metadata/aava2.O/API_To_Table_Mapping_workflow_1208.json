          "description": "**Context:**  \nYou are a SQL expert tasked with generating SELECT queries to retrieve data from database tables that align with the structure and values of a given API payload.\n\n**Input Provided:**  \n1. **API Payload:** JSON structure containing key-value pairs, data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, nested objects), and potential relationships (e.g., IDs, references).  \n{{API_PAYLOAD}}\n2. **DDL Statements:** CREATE TABLE statements defining the database schema, including primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and column data types.\n{{DDL}} \n3. **Mapping Excel File:** This excel worksheet contains the source to target mapping, with details on source table & columns, target table & columns. \n{{Mapping_Sheet}}\n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. **Analyze the API Payload:**  \n   - Identify key-value pairs, data types, and nested structures.  \n   - Determine relationships such as primary keys, foreign keys, and one-to-many mappings.  \n\n2. **Analyze the DDL Statements:**  \n   - Parse table definitions to understand schema structure.  \n   - Map relationships between tables using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.  \n\n3. **Read, Analyze, and Understand Mapping Sheet:** \n    - Read the mapping details from the input Mapping_sheet excel file. \n    - Source columns are marked as Schedule One and Target are marked as Schedule X in the header row \n    - Use the source to target mapping as additional inputs for the field mapping and SQL query generation. \n\n4. **Field Mapping:**  \n   - Map API payload fields to corresponding database columns, using the Mapping Sheet info.  \n   - Handle nested objects and arrays by identifying related tables and relationships.  \n   - Account for naming conventions (e.g., camelCase vs snake_case).  \n\n5. **Generate SQL Query:**  \n   - Create a SELECT statement that:  \n     - Includes necessary tables via JOINs.  \n     - Maps columns to the API payload structure.  \n     - Filters data using WHERE clauses based on payload values.  \n     - Handles NULL values appropriately.  \n     - Orders results logically (e.g., by primary key or timestamp).  \n\n6. **Query Optimization:**  \n   - Use appropriate JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n   - Select only necessary columns.  \n   - Suggest indexes for performance improvement if applicable.  \n   - Ensure scalability for large datasets.  \n\n**Output Format:**  \n1. **Field Mapping Table:** Show the relationship between API payload fields and database columns (e.g., `user_id \u2192 users.id`).  \n2. **SQL Query:** Provide the complete SELECT statement.  \n3. **Alternative Queries:** If multiple interpretations are possible, include alternatives.  \n\n**Special Considerations:**  \n- Handle differences in date/time formats between the API and database.  \n- Account for case sensitivity in string comparisons.  \n- Address potential data transformations.  \n- Include error handling for missing relationships.  \n- Suggest pagination for large result sets.  \n- Generate all output in markdown format \n---  \n\nThis optimized prompt is concise, focused, and incorporates SQL-specific terminology and concepts to encourage detailed, relevant responses.",

DDL Statements: Database schema definitions\n3. Generated Field Mapping: How API fields were mapped to database columns\n4. Generated SQL Query: The SELECT statement to review\n5. Original Explanation: The reasoning behind the generated query\nReview Criteria\n1. Correctness Assessment\nSchema Compliance\n* Verify all referenced tables and columns exist in the provided DDL\n* Check that JOIN conditions use valid foreign key relationships\n* Validate data type compatibility between WHERE clause values and column types\n* Ensure column aliases match the expected API payload structure\nLogic Validation\n* Confirm that JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) are appropriate for the data relationship\n* Verify WHERE clause conditions correctly filter for the payload values\n* Check that the query will return the exact data structure expected\n* Validate handling of NULL values and optional fields\n2. Completeness Review\nCoverage Analysis\n* Ensure all API payload fields are represented in the SELECT clause\n* Verify that nested objects and arrays are properly handled\n* Check if any important filtering conditions are missing\n* Confirm that the query addresses the full scope of the API payload\nEdge Cases\n* Consider what happens with empty result sets\n* Evaluate handling of optional/nullable API fields\n* Check behavior with missing foreign key relationships\n* Assess impact of duplicate records\n",
