          "description": "The agent will analyze the provided Informatica XML file to extract metadata about tables and their attributes. Based on this information, it will recommend appropriate data quality rules for each attribute. The recommendations should align with industry best practices and be tailored to the specific characteristics of the attributes (e.g., data type, expected format, business requirements).  \n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n1. **Context and Background Information:**  \n   - The Informatica XML file contains metadata about tables and their attributes, including names, data types, and constraints.  \n   - Data quality rules are essential for ensuring data integrity and consistency. Common types of rules include checks for null values, data ranges, formats, uniqueness, and date validity.  \n\n2. **Scope and Constraints:**  \n   - Focus only on the attributes listed in the XML file.  \n   - Ensure recommendations are practical and implementable.  \n   - Avoid overly complex rules unless explicitly required by the attribute's characteristics.  \n\n3. **Process Steps:**  \n   - Parse the Informatica XML file to extract table names and their attributes.  \n   - Analyze each attribute to determine its characteristics (e.g., data type, constraints).  \n   - Recommend a suitable data quality rule type for each attribute.  \n   - Provide a brief description explaining the purpose or logic behind the rule.  \n   - Generate SQL code that implements the recommended rule.  \n\n4. **Output Format:**  \n   - The output should be in **Markdown** format.  \n   - Each table and its attributes should be listed with the following structure:  \n\n     ```\n     - **Table Name**: [Table Name]\n       - **Attribute Name**: [Attribute Name]\n       - **Data Quality Rule Type**: [Rule Type]\n       - **Rule Description**: [Description]\n       - **SQL**: [SQL Code]\n     ```  \n\n   - Ensure the SQL code is syntactically correct and adheres to standard SQL practices.  \n\n5. **Quality Criteria:**  \n   - Recommendations should be accurate and relevant to the attribute's characteristics.  \n   - SQL code should be optimized and free of errors.  \n   - Formatting should be clean and easy to read.  \n\n### **SAMPLE OUTPUT:**  \n\n#### Example 1:  \n```\n- **Table Name**: Customers  \n  - **Attribute Name**: CustomerID  \n  - **Data Quality Rule Type**: UniquenessCheck  \n  - **Rule Description**: Ensure each customer has a unique identifier to avoid duplicate records.  \n  - **SQL**:  \n    ```sql  \n    SELECT CustomerID  \n    FROM Customers  \n    GROUP BY CustomerID  \n    HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 1;  \n    ```  \n\n  - **Attribute Name**: Email  \n  - **Data Quality Rule Type**: FormatCheck  \n  - **Rule Description**: Validate that the email follows standard email format (e.g., contains '@' and a domain).  \n  - **SQL**:  \n    ```sql  \n    SELECT Email  \n    FROM Customers  \n    WHERE Email NOT LIKE '%@%.%';  \n    ```  \n\n#### Example 2:  \n```\n- **Table Name**: Orders  \n  - **Attribute Name**: OrderDate  \n  - **Data Quality Rule Type**: DateCheck  \n  - **Rule Description**: Ensure the order date is not in the future.  \n  - **SQL**:  \n    ```sql  \n    SELECT OrderDate  \n    FROM Orders  \n    WHERE OrderDate > CURRENT_DATE;  \n    ```  \nInput:\n{{XML_File}}Input the xml file\n",
