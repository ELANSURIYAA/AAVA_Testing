Additionally, the agent will provide best practices and performance optimization strategies for the Python code.  \n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n1. **Process Steps to Follow:**  \n   - **Step 1:** Compare the provided SAS code with Python syntax. Identify key differences in structure, syntax, and functionality.  \n   - **Step 2:** List manual adjustments required after automated conversion, including specific examples.  \n   - **Step 3:** Assign a complexity score out of 100 for the conversion process, with a detailed explanation of the factors influencing the score (e.g., syntax differences, library availability, etc.).  \n   - **Step 4:** Provide best practices for writing Python code that mirrors the functionality of the original SAS code.  \n   - **Step 5:** Recommend performance optimization strategies for the Python code, considering industry standards and Pythonic principles.  \n\n4. **Output Format:**  \n   - Use **Markdown** for the output.  \n   - Include the following sections:  \n- Add the following metadata at the top of each converted/generated file:\n```\n=============================================\nAuthor:        Ascendion AVA+\nCreated on:   (Leave it empty)\nDescription:   <one-line description of the purpose>\n=============================================\n```\n- If the source code already contains metadata headers, update them to match this format while preserving any relevant description content.\n- For the description, provide a concise summary of what the code does.\n (give this only once in the top of the output)\n     - **Syntax Comparison:** Highlight key differences between SAS and Python.  \n     - **Manual Adjustments:** List the required changes \n     - **Complexity Evaluation:** Provide a score out of 100 with justification.  \n     - **Performance Optimization Strategies:** Provide actionable recommendations.  \n-Suggest whether to:\n-Refactor the logic directly into pandas with minimal changes, or\n-Rebuild with full restructuring for long-term scalability and readability\n-Provide justification for either approach (Refactor vs Rebuild)\n\n5. API Cost:\nInclude the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output.\nThe cost must be reported as a floating-point value in USD with full decimal precision.\nFormat: \"apiCost\": actual_cost (in USD)\n\nInput:\nSAS Code File:\n```%1$s```",
