Parse the Silver Layer DDL script to extract only Fact tables and their column definitions.\n2. Analyze the Model Conceptual and Data Constraints to identify business-critical metrics, aggregations, and necessary transformations for Fact tables.\n3. Inspect Sample Data to detect patterns, outliers, and potential standardization requirements for Fact metrics.\n4. Generate transformation rules for Fact tables, including:\n* Metric Standardization: Ensure key measures are formatted correctly and align with business KPIs.\n* Fact-Dimension Mapping: Ensure foreign keys link correctly to Dimension tables (e.g., surrogate keys, natural key mapping).\n* Data Aggregation Rules: Define pre-aggregations (e.g., monthly/quarterly summaries) where applicable.\n* Normalization and Standardization: Ensure consistency in numeric values (e.g., currency conversions, percentage calculations, rounding rules).\n* Handling Missing or Invalid Data: Define strategies for handling NULL values, missing records, or outlier data points.\n5. Provide SQL transformations for each rule, ensuring alignment with the Silver Layer schema.\n6. Ensure traceability of transformations by linking each rule back to its source from the Model Conceptual, Data Constraints, and Silver Layer schema to Gold Layer.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n1. Transformation Rules for Fact Tables:\n* [Rule Name]: [Description]\n    - Rationale: [Explanation]\n    - SQL Example: [Sample SQL transformation]\n\n2. Ensure API cost consumption is included in the output, explicitly reporting the cost as a floating-point value in USD (e.g., apiCost: actual cost).\n\nINPUTS :\n* For Model Conceptual, Data Constraints and Sample Data file use the below file as input :\n```%1$s```\n* For Silver Layer Physical DDL script and Gold Layer Physical DDL script file use the below file as input : \n```%2$s```",

This mapping will incorporate necessary transformations, aggregations, validations, and cleansing rules at the attribute level.\nYour work will be based on the Silver and Gold Layer physical model DDL scripts and the previous Fabric Gold Fact Transformation Recommender Agents' recommendations.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Review the provided Silver and Gold Layer physical model DDL scripts.\n2. Create a detailed data mapping for Fact tables from the Silver to Gold Layer, ensuring:\n* Fact-Dimension Relationships: Define foreign key mappings to Dimension tables.\n* Metric Calculations and Aggregations: Define SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, etc., where applicable.\n* Data Validation Rules: Ensure consistency in numeric and date fields (e.g., rounding rules, null handling).\n* Cleansing Logic: Handle missing values, duplicates, currency conversions, and ensure unit standardization (e.g., grams to kilograms, meters to kilometers).\n3. Ensure all transformations and rules are compatible with PySpark and Microsoft Fabric.\n4. Include explanations for complex calculations, transformations, and business rules.\n\nInputs:\n* For Silver Layer Physical DDL script and Gold Layer Physical DDL script file use the below file as input : \n```%2$s```\n* Also take input from previous Fabric Gold Fact Transformation Recommender Agent\u2019s output recommendations as input",
