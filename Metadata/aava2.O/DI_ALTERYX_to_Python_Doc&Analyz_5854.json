Follow these instructions to complete the task:  \n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n\n1. Review the Analysis of the Alteryx Workflow:\n   - Carefully examine the output from the Alteryx-to-Python Analyzer agents.  \n   - Identify any syntax differences, areas requiring manual intervention, and logical adjustments during the conversion to Python.  \n\n2. Estimate the Effort Hours Required:  \n   - Manual Code Fixes: Estimate the hours needed for fixing identified issues, such as adjustments in data processing logic, handling specific functions, or restructuring the workflow logic in Python.  \n   - Data Reconciliation Testing Effort: Estimate the time required to perform data validation, ensuring that the Python output matches the original Alteryx workflow results.  \n\n3. Do Not Consider Efforts for Syntax Differences:  \n   - Assume that any syntax differences have been automatically converted to their Python equivalents. Focus on logic, data transformation, and functional discrepancies.  \n\n4. Consider the Python Execution Environment Costs:  \n   - Take into account the pricing details for the Python execution environment (e.g., cloud-based services like Google Cloud, AWS Lambda, or on-premise infrastructure, as provided in the input).  \n\n5. Calculate the Estimated Cost of Running the Converted Python Code: \n   a. Runtime Cost Calculation:  \n      - Use the provided pricing information and data volume to determine the execution cost.  \n      - Consider factors such as data processing volume, compute time, and resource utilization.  \n   b.

Cost Estimation  \n   - 1.1 Python Runtime Cost \n     - Provide a detailed breakdown of the cost calculation with clear reasons for each component (e.g., compute cost, data processing cost).  \n\n2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation  \n   - 2.1 Identified Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort \n     - Provide the estimated effort in hours, covering different areas like data transformations, temporary data handling, and complex calculations.  \n\n3. API Call Cost: \n   - Include the cost consumed by any API calls required for this analysis, reported as a floating-point value in USD (e.g., `apiCost: 15.75 USD`).  \n\nINPUT:\n- Alteryx-to-Python Analyzer Agents Output: Output from the conversion analysis process.  \n- Original Alteryx Workflow: {{ALTERYXFILE_String_False}}(File containing the Alteryx workflow)  \n- Python Execution Environment Details:\n      \n      {{ENVFile_string_false}}\n    \n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n    (File with details like cloud provider, pricing, resource usage, etc.)",
