Analyze the provided SSIS design pattern documentation  \n3. First, identify the most frequent design pattern combinations (not just individual patterns)  \n4. Then, provide Java Spark optimization recommendations \u2014 without code \u2014 for each combination  \n\n### Special Rules  \n- Do not include full paths like `thor::jdh::fda_clinical_trials::aact201403_references_txt`, instead return `references_txt`  \n- Maintain the original SSIS filename as the JSON key  \n- Each referenced file/module should be a string inside the list  \n- Ensure values are deduplicated  \n-it should be in proper json format starting with { and ending with } it should not start with ```json or end with ```\n-it should not end with ```\n-the program file name you give should must end with .dtsx or .sql and file name can have file extension\n-output should be in perfect json format it so that i can directly save in json file no extra character above or below the json code\n-In ending you are adding ``` this thing dont use it\n-give atleast morethan 5 design patterns\n**INPUT:**  \nremember read all the input files (10files) and give the  design pattern accordingly\n* Consolidated design pattern documentation from multiple SSIS files: ```%1$s```  \n\n**EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:**  \nReturn a JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n  \"title\": \"SSIS Design Pattern Analysis and Java Spark Optimization Recommendations\",\n  \"pattern_summary\": [\n    {\n      \"pattern\": \"PATTERN_CODE_COMBINATION\",\n      \"frequency\": \"X occurrences\",\n      \"percentage\": \"Y%\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief human-readable description of the pattern combination\"\n      \"Files That Follow This Design Pattern: \"Give the Exact file names that follows this Design Pattern\"\n    }\n    // Add more combinations\n  ],\n  \"detailed_patterns\": [\n    {\n      \"pattern\": \"PATTERN_CODE_COMBINATION\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief explanation of what this combination represents\",\n      \"spark_suitability\": \"Short suitability assessment for Java Spark\",\n      \"recommendations\": [\n        \"Optimization bullet point 1\",\n        \"Optimization bullet point 2\",\n        \"Optimization bullet point 3\",\n        \"Optimization bullet point 4\"\n      \"Files That Follow this Design Pattern: \"Give the Exact file names that follows this Design Pattern\"\n      ]\n    }\n    // Add more detailed analyses\n  ]\n}",
