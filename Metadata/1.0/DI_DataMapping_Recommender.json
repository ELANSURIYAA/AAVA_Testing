                "description": "**DESCRIPTION:**  \nThe agent is tasked with mapping specific fields between the legacy application (v10) and the modern application (v12). The v10 file contains details of data attributes in an object model, including field labels used in webpages. The v12 mapping file includes tables, columns, column descriptions, and API paths. The focus is on mapping the v10 fields 'Entity_Key' and 'Attr_Name' with v12 fields 'Table Name' and 'Column Name' \n\nThe agent must use display names, descriptions, and other relevant fields to establish accurate mappings for each attribute. Additionally, the agent should provide a confidence score for each mapping, indicating the reliability of the match.  \n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n1. **Context and Background Information:**  \n   - The v10 file represents the legacy application's object model, which includes field labels and descriptions used in webpages.  \n   - The v12 mapping file represents the modern application's database schema, including tables, columns, column descriptions, and API paths.  \n   - The goal is to align the data structures between the two systems to ensure compatibility and functionality during the migration.  \n\n2. **Scope and Constraints:**  \n   - Focus only on mapping the fields 'Entity_Key' and 'Attr_Name' from v10 to the 'Table Name' and 'Column Name' fields in v12 \n   - Ensure mappings are based on logical connections derived from display names, descriptions, and other metadata.  \n   - Provide a confidence score for each mapping (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on the strength of the match.  \n   - Avoid assumptions; rely only on provided data and metadata for mapping decisions.  \n\n3. **Process Steps to Follow:**  \n   - Parse the v10 file to extract 'Entity_Key' and 'Attr_Name'  fields along with their display names and descriptions.  \n   - Parse the v12 mapping file to extract 'Table Name' and 'Column Name' columns along with their descriptions and API paths.  \n   - Compare the metadata (e.g., display names, descriptions) from v10 fields with v12 columns to identify potential matches between these columns 'Entity_Key' and 'Attr_Name' with 'Table Name' and 'Column Name'\n   - For each match, assign a confidence score based on the following criteria:  \n     - **High:** Exact match based on display name and description.  \n     - **Medium:** Partial match based on either display name or description.  \n     - **Low:** Match inferred from indirect metadata or contextual clues.  \n   - Document the mappings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and traceability.  \n\n4. **Output Format:**  \nProvide the mappings in Markdown format. All the following fields must be present for each mapping:\n 'Entity_Key' ,'Attr_Name' , 'Table Name' , 'Column Name',MappingScore, ReasonforScore\n\n5. **Quality Criteria:**  \n   - Ensure mappings are logical, accurate, and traceable.  \n   - Confidence scores should be justified based on metadata analysis.  \n   - Output should be well-structured, formatted, and adhere to markdown format\n---\nNote:\n-Must use the file writer tool and download the output as .md format and name the file as \"v12migrationoutput.md\"\nInput:\n*for the  'Entity_Key' ,'Attr_Name'  fields input use the v10 file : {{v10_file}}\n*for the  'Table Name' , 'Column Name' fields  input use v12 file : {{v12_file}}",
