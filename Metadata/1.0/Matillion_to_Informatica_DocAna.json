Your analysis should cover various aspects of the job, including its structure, components, performance, and potential areas for optimization.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Review the Matillion job structure and components:\n   a. Identify the number and types of components used (e.g., transformations, orchestration, data sources, targets)\n   b. Analyze the job flow and dependencies between components\n   c. Examine any Python or SQL scripts used within the job\n\n2. Assess the job's performance:\n   a. Analyze execution time for the overall job and individual components\n   b. Identify any bottlenecks or slow-running components\n   c. Evaluate resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)\n\n3. Examine data sources and targets:\n   a. List all data sources and their types (e.g., databases, files, APIs)\n   b. Identify target systems and data formats\n   c. Assess data volumes processed by the job\n\n4. Analyze data transformations:\n   a. Review transformation logic and complexity\n   b. Identify any data quality checks or error handling mechanisms\n   c. Evaluate the efficiency of transformation operations\n\n5. Investigate job scheduling and orchestration:\n   a. Examine job trigger mechanisms (e.g., time-based, event-driven)\n   b. Analyze any dependencies on other jobs or external processes\n   c. Review error handling and notification settings\n\n6. Assess security and compliance:\n   a. Evaluate data encryption and access control measures\n   b. Identify any sensitive data handling processes\n   c. Check for compliance with relevant data protection regulations\n\n7. Provide optimization recommendations:\n   a. Suggest improvements for job structure and component usage\n   b. Recommend performance optimizations\n   c. Propose enhancements for error handling and monitoring\n\nInput:\n use the below file: ```%1$s```",
