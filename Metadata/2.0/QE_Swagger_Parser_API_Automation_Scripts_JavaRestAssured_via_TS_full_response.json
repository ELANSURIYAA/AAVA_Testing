                    "description": "As a lead API integrator in a dynamic tech firm, you are working on developing a tool that assists in reviewing and debugging API endpoints.\n\nInput:- You will receive a Swagger JSON file inside the zip file uploaded by user as input.\n\nYour task is to accept Swagger JSON file as input and perform the sub tasks as per the instructions given under it.\n\nSub-Task 1:-\nInstructions:-\n1. Accept the Swagger JSON file.\n2. Traverse the \"paths\" object in the JSON.\n3. For each path, inspect and list which HTTP methods (limit to GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT) are implemented.\n4. Under each path, there could be multiple HTTP methods. In that case, list that path under all those HTTP methods.\n5. Organize the final output by having separate sections for GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT, each listing the corresponding endpoints.\n6. Look for either \"host\" or \"url\" key. The value of it should be added in the output as \"BaseURI\". Refer the example output.\n7. Form the JSON structure of the output as given in the example output.\n\nExample output of this Sub-Task 1:-\n{\n   \"GET\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/findByStatus\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"DELETE\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"POST\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"PUT\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"BaseURI\": \"http://www.petstore.com\"\n}\n\nSub-Task 2:-\nInstructions:-\n1. Accept the Swagger JSON file.\n2. Accept the output JSON of Sub-Task 1. From this output, consider the paths listed under GET.\n3. For each of the GET endpoints, iterate from Step-4 to Step-23. When all the GET endpoints are processed, go to Step-25.\n\n4. Look at the endpoint.\n   IF there is a curly brace in the endpoints, for example, \"/pet/{petId}\",\n     then follow from Step-5 to Step-9.\n   ELSE\n     go to step-10.\n\n5. Get inside that endpoint object in the json. Look at the \"parameters\" array.\n6. In the \"parameter\" array, you will find \"name\". The value of the \"name\" should be same as the value inside the curly brace in the endpoint.\n   In the example, inside the \"parameter\" array, \"name\" value should be 'petId' which is same as 'petId' in the curly brace of the endpoint \"/pet/{petId}\n7. In that same object of \"parameter\" array, where the \"name\" matches, consider the value of \"type\".\n8. Update that endpoint by replacing the entire curly brace with the value of \"type\".\n   In the example, the updated endpoint would be \"/pet/integer\".\n9. Map this updated endpoint to the original path value as output. Refer to the first object element under GET array in the sample output of Sub-Task 2. Go to Step-23.\n\n10. Get inside that endpoint object in the json. Look at the \"parameters\" array.\n   IF there is only 1 object element in the \"parameter\" array, AND in that object element \"in\" has value 'path' \n     then follow from Step-11 to Step-15\n   ELSE\n     go to step-16\n\n11. In that object element, take a note of the value of \"name\".\n12. In that same object element, take a note of the value of \"type\" under \"items\" object. If \"items\" object is not present, then note the value of \"type\" under that same object element.\n13. In that same object element, under \"items\" object, there could be Enum values. Take a note of the Enum values. This is optional as it may be or may not be present.\n14. Update that endpoint by concatenating the following at the end - \n    - add '?' at the end\n    - then add the value of the \"name\" (noted in the above step-11) at the end\n    - then add '=' at the end\n    - then add the value of the \"type\" (noted in the above step-12) at the end\n\n   For example: For the endpoint \"/pet/findByStatus\", the value of \"name\" is 'status' and the value of \"type\" is 'string'.\n   So, the updated endpoint is '/pet/findByStatus?status=string'\n\n15. Map this updated endpoint to the original path value. Refer to the second object element under GET array in the sample output of Sub-Task 2. Go to Step-23.\n\n16. IF there are multiple object elements in the \"parameter\" array\n      then iterate from Step-17 to Step-21 for each of the object elements in the \"parameter\" array that have \"in\" value as 'path'. For any other object element where \"in\" value is other than 'path' then skip that object element.\n    ELSE\n      go to step-22.\n\n17. In the object element, take a note of the value of the \"name\".\n18. In the object element, take a note of the value of \"type\" under \"items\" object. If \"items\" object is not present, then note the value of \"type\" under that same object element.\n19. In the object element, under \"items\" object, there could be Enum values. Take a note of the Enum values. This is optional as it may be or may not be present.\n20. Update that endpoint by concatenating the following at the end - \n    - IF this object element is the first element of the array\n       then add '?' at the end\n      ELSE IF this object element is not the first element of the array\n       then add '&' at the end\n    - then add the value of the \"name\" (noted in the above step-17) at the end\n    - then add '=' at the end\n    - then add the value of the \"type\" (noted in the above step-18) at the end\n\n   For example: For the endpoint \"/user/login\", there are two object elements inside \"parameter\" array and none of them have \"items\" object. First object element have the value of \"name\" is 'username' and the value of \"type\" is 'string'. Second object element have the value of \"name\" is 'password' and the value of \"type\" is 'string.\n   So, the updated endpoint is '/user/login?username=string&password=string'\n\n21. Map this updated endpoint to the original path value. Refer to the third object element under GET array in the sample output of Sub-Task 2. Go to Step-23.\n\n22. IF there are no curly brace in the endpoint, AND there are no elements in the \"parameters\" array or there is no \"parameter\" field at all\n      then the endpoint is same as the path \n\n23. Fetch the response codes of the endpoint object. Segregate the response codes based on the description. Successful response codes will be added to the \"successful\" array of the example output of this agent, and all the other response codes for invalid response will be added in the \"failure\" array of the example output of this agent. If there is no response codes found for successful or failure, then put null value corresponding to its key in the output. Refer to any of the object element under GET array in the sample output of Sub-Task 2.\n24. Go back to Step-4.\n\n25. POST, PUT and DELETE arrays of the output of Sub-Task 1 should be untouched. Only GET array is modified as per Sub-Task 2. And this output will be required to perform Sub-Task 3.\n26. END of Sub-Task 2.\n\nExample output of this Sub-Task 2:-\n{\n   \"GET\": [\n    {\n       \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\",\n       \"endpoint\": \"/pet/integer\",\n       \"enum\": null,\n       \"reponseCodes\": {\n           \"successful\": [\"200\",\"201\"],\n           \"failure\": [\"400\",\"404\"]\n       }\n    },\n    {\n       \"path\": \"/pet/findByStatus\",\n       \"endpoint\": \"/pet/findByStatus?status=string\",\n       //if this Enum is present then have the below or else make the value as null.\n       \"enum\": {\n          \"name\": \"status\",\n          \"value\": [\n             \"pending\",\n             \"available\"\n          ]\n       },\n       \"reponseCodes\": {\n           \"successful\": [\"200\",\"201\"],\n           \"failure\": null\n       }\n    },\n    {\n       \"path\": \"/user/login\",\n       \"endpoint\": \"/user/login?username=string&password=string\",\n       \"enum\": null,\n       \"reponseCodes\": {\n           \"successful\": null,\n           \"failure\": null\n       }\n    }\n   ],\n   \"DELETE\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"POST\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet/{petId}\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"PUT\": [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"/pet\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"BaseURI\": \"http://www.petstore.com\"\n}\n\nSub-Task 3:-\nInstructions:-\n1. Accept the Swagger JSON file.\n2. Accept the output JSON of Sub-Task 2. From this output, consider the paths listed under DELETE.\n3. For each of the DELETE endpoints, iterate from Step-4 to Step-23. When all the DELETE endpoints are processed, go to Step-25.\n\n4.

Accept the Swagger JSON file.\n2. Accept the output JSON of Sub-Task 3. From this output, consider the paths listed under POST.\n3. For each of the POST endpoints, iterate from Step-4 to Step-26. When all the POST endpoints are processed, go to Step-27.\n\n4. Look at the endpoint.\n   IF there is no curly brace in the endpoint, for example, \"/pet\"\n     then endpoint is the same as the path. Follow from Step-5.\n   ELSE\n     then go to Step-19.\n\n5. Inside that endpoint object, you will either get \"parameters\" array of objects or \"requestBody\" object.\n\n6. IF:\n     If there is \"parameter\" array objects and there is at least one object element having \"name\"='body'\n        then go to that object element that have \"name\"='body' and \"schema\" is present. Note the value of \"$ref\" under \"schema\". Go to Step-7.\n   ELSE IF:\n     If there is \"requestBody\" object, then go to the \"schema\". Note the value of \"$ref\" under \"schema\". Go to Step-7.\n   ELSE:\n     If there is \"parameter\" but no object element having \"name\"='body' OR there is no \"requestBody\", then that endpoint does not have any payload body schema. Make it null in the output. Go to Step-17.\n\n7. The value of \"ref\" under \"schema\" is the path of the request payload schema. \"#\" represents the JSON start.\n8. Traverse this $ref value as a node path in this Swagger JSON to find this object.\n9. In this object, you will get \"type\" and \"properties\". \"Type\" value can be \"object\" or \"array\". This \"type\" represents the type of the payload type. If \"object\" then start and end with curly brace like \"{}\" and if \"array\" then start and end with square bracket like \"[]\" and build at least 2 array elements.\n10. Under \"properties\" field, you will get either (a) at least one field \"body\", or (b) there are no fields called \"body\"\n\n11. IF:\n      If there is at least one field \"body\", then go into that field \"body\". You will get \"$ref\" field. Note that value of $ref. And GO TO Step-7 and continue from that point.\n    ELSE:\n      If there are no fields \"body\" then you will get each field name under the \"properties\" is the field name in the payload body. Continue from Instruction Step-12 as below.\n\n12. Under each field, you will get either (a) \"type\" or (b) \"$ref\".\n\n13. IF:\n      If \"type\" is present, then mention its value corresponding to each field name in the payload body\n    ELSE:\n      If \"$ref\" is present. Note that value of $ref. And GO TO Step-7 and continue from that point.\n\n14. If there is any enums under any of the field, note the enum values against that field name under that endpoint json.\n\n15. You may have to loop recursively from Step-11 or from Step-13 to Step-6 for few times for each endpoints untill there are no further \"$ref\".\n16. The payload schema will be built after the end of the recursive loop. Map that payload schema with the original endpoint and proceed to Step-17.\n\n17. You will get consumable contentType value under each respective endpoint. Add that also under that endpoint json.\n18. Fetch the response codes of the endpoint object. Segregate the response codes based on the description. Successful response codes will be added to the \"successful\" array of the example output of this agent, and all the other response codes for invalid response will be added in the \"failure\" array of the example output of this agent. If there is no response codes found for successful or failure, then put null value corresponding to its key in the output. GO TO Step-26. \n\n19. IF there is curly brace in the endpoint, for example, \"/pet/{petId}\",\n      then follow Step-20 to Step-25.\n\n20. Get inside that endpoint object in the json. Look at the \"parameters\" array.\n21. In the \"parameter\" array, you will find \"name\". The value of the \"name\" should be same as the value inside the curly brace in the endpoint.\n    In the example, inside the \"parameter\" array, \"name\" value should be 'petId' which is same as 'petId' in the curly brace of the endpoint \"/pet/{petId}\n22. In that same object of \"parameter\" array, where the \"name\" matches, consider the value of \"type\".\n23. Update that endpoint by replacing the entire curly brace with the value of \"type\".\n    In the example, the updated endpoint would be \"/pet/integer\".\n24. Map this updated endpoint to the original path value as output.\n25. Now to build for the Payload Body Schema, Content-Type and Response Code, GO TO Step-5 and continue from there.\n\n26. GO Back TO Step-3.\n\n27. GET, DELETE and PUT arrays of the output of Sub-Task 3 should be untouched. Only POST array is modified as per Sub-Task 4. And this output will be required to perform Sub-Task 5.\n28.

Accept the Swagger JSON file.\n2. Accept the output JSON of Sub-Task 4. From this output, consider the paths listed under PUT.\n3. For each of the PUT endpoints, iterate from Step-4 to Step-26. When all the PUT endpoints are processed, go to Step-27.\n\n4. Look at the endpoint.\n   IF there is no curly brace in the endpoint, for example, \"/pet\"\n     then endpoint is the same as the path. Follow from Step-5.\n   ELSE\n     then go to Step-19.\n\n5. Inside that endpoint object, you will either get \"parameters\" array of objects or \"requestBody\" object.\n\n6. IF:\n     If there is \"parameter\" array objects and there is at least one object element having \"name\"='body'\n        then go to that object element that have \"name\"='body' and \"schema\" is present. Note the value of \"$ref\" under \"schema\". Go to Step-7.\n   ELSE IF:\n     If there is \"requestBody\" object, then go to the \"schema\". Note the value of \"$ref\" under \"schema\". Go to Step-7.\n   ELSE:\n     If there is \"parameter\" but no object element having \"name\"='body' OR there is no \"requestBody\", then that endpoint does not have any payload body schema. Make it null in the output. Go to Step-17.\n\n7. The value of \"ref\" under \"schema\" is the path of the request payload schema. \"#\" represents the JSON start.\n8. Traverse this $ref value as a node path in this Swagger JSON to find this object.\n9. In this object, you will get \"type\" and \"properties\". \"Type\" value can be \"object\" or \"array\". This \"type\" represents the type of the payload type. If \"object\" then start and end with curly brace like \"{}\" and if \"array\" then start and end with square bracket like \"[]\" and build at least 2 array elements.\n10. Under \"properties\" field, you will get either (a) at least one field \"body\", or (b) there are no fields called \"body\"\n\n11. IF:\n      If there is at least one field \"body\", then go into that field \"body\". You will get \"$ref\" field. Note that value of $ref. And GO TO Step-7 and continue from that point.\n    ELSE:\n      If there are no fields \"body\" then you will get each field name under the \"properties\" is the field name in the payload body. Continue from Instruction Step-12 as below.\n\n12. Under each field, you will get either (a) \"type\" or (b) \"$ref\".\n\n13. IF:\n      If \"type\" is present, then mention its value corresponding to each field name in the payload body\n    ELSE:\n      If \"$ref\" is present. Note that value of $ref. And GO TO Step-7 and continue from that point.\n\n14. If there is any enums under any of the field, note the enum values against that field name under that endpoint json.\n\n15. You may have to loop recursively from Step-11 or from Step-13 to Step-6 for few times for each endpoints untill there are no further \"$ref\".\n16. The payload schema will be built after the end of the recursive loop. Map that payload schema with the original endpoint and proceed to Step-17.\n\n17. You will get consumable contentType value under each respective endpoint. Add that also under that endpoint json.\n18. Fetch the response codes of the endpoint object. Segregate the response codes based on the description. Successful response codes will be added to the \"successful\" array of the example output of this agent, and all the other response codes for invalid response will be added in the \"failure\" array of the example output of this agent. If there is no response codes found for successful or failure, then put null value corresponding to its key in the output. GO TO Step-26. \n\n19. IF there is curly brace in the endpoint, for example, \"/pet/{petId}\",\n      then follow Step-20 to Step-25.\n\n20. Get inside that endpoint object in the json. Look at the \"parameters\" array.\n21. In the \"parameter\" array, you will find \"name\". The value of the \"name\" should be same as the value inside the curly brace in the endpoint.\n    In the example, inside the \"parameter\" array, \"name\" value should be 'petId' which is same as 'petId' in the curly brace of the endpoint \"/pet/{petId}\n22. In that same object of \"parameter\" array, where the \"name\" matches, consider the value of \"type\".\n23. Update that endpoint by replacing the entire curly brace with the value of \"type\".\n    In the example, the updated endpoint would be \"/pet/integer\".\n24. Map this updated endpoint to the original path value as output.\n25. Now to build for the Payload Body Schema, Content-Type and Response Code, GO TO Step-5 and continue from there.\n\n26. GO Back TO Step-3.\n\n27. GET, DELETE and POST arrays of the output of Sub-Task 4 should be untouched. Only PUT array is modified as per Sub-Task 5.\n28.

Create an \"ApiProcessor\" class.\n2. In this \"ApiProcessor\" class, there should be 4 methods for each GET, DELETE, POST and PUT. Name the methods like triggerGET, triggerDELETE, etc.\n3. Each ApiProcessor  Methods should accept the arguments - baseURI, endpointParameter, contentType and payloadAsString.\n4. Do not include contentType and payloadAsString variable in GET and DELETE.\n5. Inside each ApiProcessor Methods, you should do the following - \n   A. Initialize the RestAssured baseURI.\n   B. Set the RequestSpecification request variable using Rest Assured Given. In this use relaxedHTTPSValidation and urlEncodingEnabled as false\n   C. Run the request using the proper RestAssured Method type as per the ApiProcessor Method name into Response.\n   D. Log the Response using Then.Log.All.\n   E. Get the Status Code from the Response and return it.\n\n6. Create a \"Main\" class and have void main in it.\n   A. Create an object of ApiProcessor class.\n   B. Repeat the following steps (from point C to point F) for each of the POST endpoints in Test_Scenario_JSON (given as input to you)\n   C. Comment in the main class with endpoint value and scenario type = positive or negative and scenario description value to create a section for all the below mentioned points.\n   D. For each positive scenarios and negative scenarios in each of the array call trigger POST method of ApiProcessor.\n         For example, if there are 2 positive scenarios, then call trigger POST method 2 times and if there are 3 negative scenarios, then call trigger method 3 times. So in total, 5 times call to trigger POST method. \n   E. For these trigger POST method call, pass baseURI, endpointParameter, contentType and payloadAsString.\n         a. Endpoint Parameter value starts from \"/\" in the endpoint key of Test_Scenario_JSON\n         b. contentType value is the value of contentType under that endpoint object of Test_Scenario_JSON.\n         c. payloadAsString is the value of \"body\" under each endpoint object of Test_Scenario_JSON\n   F. For each trigger POST method call, accept the response code returned. Assert that response code with the expectedResponseCodes array values mentioned under that endpoint object of Test_Scenario_JSON.\n         a. If returned response codes matches with any one of the expectedResponseCodes array elements, then that test is pass.\n         b. If returned response codes do not match with any of the expectedResponseCodes array elements, then that test is fail.\n\nGive the output of these 2 classes only. No explanation is required. Also, provide the required maven dependencies to run the code accordingly.",
