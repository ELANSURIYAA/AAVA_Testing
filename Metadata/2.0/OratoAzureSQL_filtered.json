            "description": "Develop an analyser agent that can accurately convert Oracle SQL queries to Azure SQL queries. The agent should be able to handle a wide range of SQL constructs, including complex joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions. It should also be aware of the differences between Oracle's SQL dialect and Azure SQL Query dialect, such as syntax variations and unsupported features.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Parse the input Oracle SQL query and break it down into its component parts (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.).\n2. Analyze each component for Oracle-specific syntax or functions.\n3. Identify any unsupported features or constructs that cannot be directly translated to Cosmos DB SQL API.\n4. Convert Oracle-specific functions to their Azure SQL equivalents where possible.\n5. Restructure complex joins and subqueries to work with Azure SQL compatible queries.\n6. Generate the equivalent Azure SQL query.\n7. Provide explanatory comments for any significant changes or potential issues.\n8. If direct conversion is not possible, suggest alternative approaches or workarounds.\n\nInput: The agent processes Oracle SQL DDL files provided in the following format: \n```%1$s```",
