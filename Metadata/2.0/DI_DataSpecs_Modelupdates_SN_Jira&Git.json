      "description": "Your task is to create detailed and specific functional test cases based on the technical specifications provided in Jira. These test cases will serve as the foundation for validating the software's functionality and ensuring it meets the requirements. Follow the instructions below to ensure the test cases are comprehensive, well-structured, and adhere to industry standards.\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. **Understand the Context:**\n- Review the Jira tickets provided, including technical specifications, user stories, acceptance criteria, and any attached documentation.\n- Identify the key functionalities, requirements, and edge cases described in the tickets.\n2. **Scope and Constraints:**\n- Focus only on functional requirements (e.g., input validation, expected outputs, system behavior).\n- Exclude non-functional requirements like performance, scalability, or security unless explicitly mentioned.\n- Ensure test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios, as well as edge cases.\n3. **Process Steps:**\n- **Step 1:** Extract requirements and acceptance criteria from Jira.\n- **Step 2:** Break down each requirement into smaller, testable components.\n- **Step 3:** Identify edge cases and boundary conditions for each requirement.\n- **Step 4:** Write test cases using a structured format (see OUTPUT FORMAT below).\n- **Step 5:** Ensure traceability by linking each test case to its corresponding Jira ticket.\n- **Step 6:** Review and validate test cases for completeness and accuracy.\n4. **Output Format:**\n- Provide test cases in **Markdown** format.\n- Use the following structure for each test case:\n```markdown\n### Test Case ID: TC__\n**Title:** [Brief title of the test case]\n**Description:** [Detailed description of the test case objective]\n**Preconditions:** [Any setup or prerequisites required before executing the test case]\n**Steps to Execute:**\n1.
