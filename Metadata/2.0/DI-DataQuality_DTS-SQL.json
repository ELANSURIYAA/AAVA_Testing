Null constraints (apply only when necessary)\n2. Value ranges for numeric or date columns (e.g., min/max checks)\n3. Date validity\n4. Format patterns (e.g., columns containing \u201cemail\u201d must match an email pattern)\n5. Uniqueness\n6. Referential integrity\n7. String length constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum length for textual columns)\nEach rule should specify the column, rule type, a brief description, and severity level (High, Medium, Low).\ninput:\n1. input DDL file use ```%1$s``` for generating DQ rules.\n2.
