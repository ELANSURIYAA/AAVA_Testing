The agent must follow the instructions below to ensure accurate and meaningful results.  \n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS**  \n#### **Context and Background Information:**  \n- Questions may vary slightly in wording but convey the same intent or meaning.  \n- The goal is to identify both exact duplicates (identical text) and near-duplicates (minor variations in phrasing but same intent).  \n\n#### **Scope and Constraints:**  \n- Ensure that the analysis accounts for semantic similarity, not just textual similarity.  \n- Avoid grouping questions that differ significantly in meaning or context.  \n- Provide clear justifications for near-duplicate groupings to ensure transparency.  \n\n#### **Process Steps:**  \nDo not make any assumptions. Take input only from the attached file.\n1. **Input Parsing:**  \n   - Accept the input file.  \n   - Extract and organize the questions.  \n\n2. **Column Mapping:**   \n       - The file contains multiple columns, including 'question' related column(ycadmissions__Question_Text__c) and 'dependency-related questions.'  \n   - The 'question' related column(ycadmissions__Question_Text__c) contains the primary data of interest.\n\n3. **Duplicate Detection:**  \n   - Compare each question with every other question in the list.  \n   - Identify exact or near-duplicates.\n   - Identify near-duplicates using semantic similarity analysis (e.g., minor rewording, synonyms, or paraphrasing).  \n\n3. **Grouping:**  \n   - Group duplicate and near-duplicate questions together.  \n   - Assign each group a unique identifier (e.g., Group 1, Group 2, etc.).  \n\n4. **Justification:**  \n   - For near-duplicates, provide a brief explanation of why the questions are grouped together (e.g., \"Both questions ask about enrollment deadlines using different phrasing\").  \n\n5. **Output Generation:**  \n   - Produce the output in the specified format (see below).  \n   - Ensure the output is clear, concise, and adheres to industry standards.  \n\nNOTE: Do not consider the questions from dependency column. Consider only from the questions column(ycadmissions__Question_Text__c)\n\n### **OUTPUT FORMAT:**  \nDuplicate Group 1:\n- Q1: [Question text]\n- Q2: [Duplicate question text]\nReason\n- Provide this in json format along with the other columns as well\n\nDuplicate Group 2:\n- Q20: [Question text]\n- Q28: [Duplicate question text]\nReason\n- Provide this in json format along with the other columns as well\n\n\nInput:\nTake this File as Input: '''%1$s'''",

            "description": "The agent is tasked with normalizing grouped duplicate questions received from the Grouping Agent. Each group contains questions with the same Group ID. The agent must either select the cleanest version of the question from the group or generate a new normalized version using predefined rules or a language model. The normalized version should replace the text of all duplicates within the group, while maintaining the original rows and IDs.\n\n### **INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n\n1. **Context and Background:**  \n   - The input consists of grouped questions, each identified by a shared Group ID.  \n   - Questions within the same group are duplicates but may vary in phrasing, formatting, or clarity.  \n   - The goal is to ensure all questions in a group are replaced with a single normalized version.\n\n2. **Scope and Constraints:**  \n   - Ensure the normalized version is clear, concise, and grammatically correct.  \n   - Avoid introducing ambiguity or altering the original intent of the question.  \n   - Maintain all rows and IDs as provided in the input data.  \n\n3. **Process Steps:**  \n   - **Step 1:** Analyze the grouped questions to identify duplicates.  \n   - **Step 2:** Determine the cleanest version of the question within the group.  \n     - Criteria for selection: clarity, grammatical correctness, and minimal redundancy.  \n   - **Step 3:** If no single question meets the criteria, generate a normalized version using predefined rules or a language model.  \n     - Rules: Remove unnecessary words, fix grammar, and ensure consistency in phrasing.  \n     - Example: Convert \"What is the best way to learn Python programming?\" and \"How can I learn Python programming effectively?\" into \"How can I learn Python programming?\"  \n   - **Step 4:** Overwrite the text of all duplicates in the group with the normalized version, ensuring the Group ID and other metadata remain unchanged.  \n   - **Step 4:** After normalizing the questions in the ycadmissions__Question_Text__c\ncolumn, also normalize the questions in the Dependency column, ensuring they match the wording of the corresponding normalized Name column questions.\n -  Focus only on the rows where both \"ycadmissions__Question_Text__c\n\" and \"Dependency\" columns have non-empty values.  \n   - Ensure that the normalization process for the \"Dependency\" column does not alter the meaning or intent of the question.  \n   - Maintain proper grammar, spelling, and formatting during normalization.  \n   - Avoid introducing any new information or assumptions beyond what is provided in the \"ycadmissions__Question_Text__c\" column.  \n4. **Output Format:**  \n   - **Format:** JSON  \n   - **Structure:**  \n     [\n  {\n    \"GroupID\": \"\",\n    \"OriginalQuestions\": [\n      \"OriginalQuestion 1\",\n      \"OriginalQuestion 2\",\n      \"OriginalQuestion 3\",\n      \"OriginalQuestion 4\"\n      // ...include as many entries as there are duplicate questions in this group\n    ],\n    \"NormalizedQuestion\": \"\",\n    \"DependencyQuestions\": [\n      \"DependencyQuestion 1\",\n      \"DependencyQuestion 2\",\n      \"DependencyQuestion 3\",\n      \"DependencyQuestion 4\"\n      // ...include as many entries as there are dependency questions linked to the above duplicates\n    ],\n    \"NormalizedDependencyQuestion\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n     ```  \n   - **Quality Criteria:**  \n     - The normalized question should be concise, grammatically correct, and free of redundancy.  \n     - Ensure the original intent of the question is preserved.  \n     - Maintain consistent formatting across all outputs.  \n\nInput :\n* Take the 1st agents output as an input\n* Take the previous agents output as an input\n",
