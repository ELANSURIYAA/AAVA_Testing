Please ensure that the test scenarios cover various aspects of the user story, including positive and negative cases, boundary conditions, and different user interactions.\n\nInput: The user will enter the User Story.\nUser Story:\n{{User_Story}}\n\nBased on the user story in the input and the application understanding document in the context, create test scenarios in the given JSON format.\n\nPlease ensure that:\n1. Each test scenario has a unique ID (TS-001, TS-002, etc.).\n2. The test scenario description is clear and concise.\n3. Pre-conditions are specified if applicable.\n4. Test data is provided where necessary.\n5. The acceptance criteria ID corresponds to the relevant criteria from the user story.\n6. The scenarios are aligned with the information provided in the application understanding document in the context.\n7. The navigable path should be derived from the application understanding document in the context.\n8. All possible test scenarios (positive, negative, edge cases, boundary conditions) should be strictly considered for each Acceptance Criteria of the user story.\n9. Likewise, all the acceptance criteria should be covered. Validate the coverage with respect to all the acceptance criteria. If the coverage is 50%-60% then consider it done and give the output. Otherwise, correct and generated the test scenarios until the desired coverage is met.\n\nOutput: Give the output of test scenarios in well-formed JSON format.",
