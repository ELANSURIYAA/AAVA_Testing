Follow these instructions to ensure the task is completed effectively:\nINPUT:\n1. csv file with n number of rows of sql data.\n2. json file with schema details for transform data from mysql to mongodb.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Analyze the input csv file with sql data.\n2. Allocate different 200 rows to each agent until you reach end of file.\n3. Assign each portion to a specific worker agent, ensuring no overlap between portions.\n4. Provide clear instructions to each worker agent on their assigned portion, including any specific transformation rules or requirements.\n5. Monitor the progress of each worker agent and ensure that they adhere to the transformation rules.\n6. First row of csv is the column names, make sure each agent receives the data with first row as column name.\n7.

Follow these detailed instructions to complete the task:\nLook for \"INSTRUCTIONS\", \"Batch Processing Guidelines\" and \"OUTPUT FORMAT\" before converting the data.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Review the provided MongoDB schema file to understand the structure and requirements for the JSON data.\n2. Use the CSV token manager tool to process the CSV data in manageable batches.

Handle any necessary transformations or data type conversions.\n4. Validate the transformed data against the MongoDB schema to ensure compliance and accuracy.\n5. Use the file writer tool to write the transformed data into JSON format. Ensure that the output adheres to industry standards for JSON formatting.\n6. Repeat the process for all batches until the entire CSV dataset is converted.\n7. Perform a final validation of the JSON output to ensure data integrity and schema compliance.\n\n\n**Batch Processing Guidelines**\n\n- The CSV file is large\u2014process data in **batches of 50 rows**.\n- Begin with `offset = 0`.\n- For **each batch**:\n  - Call the **CSV Token Limit Manager** with parameters: `file_path`, `batch_size`, and `offset`.\n  - Transform the returned batch into MongoDB JSON documents.\n  - Append each batch\u2019s output to the cumulative JSON array.\n  - Increment `offset` by `batch_size` after each batch.\n\n**Do not prompt** for user interaction between batches. Continue automatically until a batch returns no data (EOF).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- The output should be a JSON file containing the converted data structured according to the MongoDB schema.\n- Each JSON object should represent a single record from the CSV data.\n- Do **not** include incomplete placeholders (e.g., `// continued`).\n- Combine all transformed documents into a single valid JSON array.\n- Ensure proper escaping of special characters and adherence to JSON syntax.\n\n\n\nSAMPLE:\nInput CSV:\n\"id,name,age,city\"\n\"1,John Doe,30,New York\"\n\"2,Jane Smith,25,Los Angeles\"\nMongoDB Schema:\n{\n  \"_id\": \"ObjectId\",\n  \"name\": \"String\",\n  \"age\": \"Number\",\n  \"city\": \"String\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"age\": 25,\n    \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"\n  }\n]\nEnsure that the final JSON file is properly formatted and ready for import into MongoDB.",
