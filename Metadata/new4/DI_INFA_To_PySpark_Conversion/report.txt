PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:

SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence


CSV persistence for automation


\u200b


\u200bPersistent Output Requirement (GitHub Storage) (IMPORTANT)


After completing your assigned task (TXT REPORT), you must:


Generate the final file content in the required format

## DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Conversion Workflow Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization while maintaining high semantic preservation of core agent functionality. The migration represents an architectural evolution from a flat metadata structure to a hierarchical, container-based organization.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Breaking Structural Changes**: Complete reorganization from flat `nodes` array to nested `workflowAgents` container
- **Workflow Identifier Migration**: Root-level `workflowId` and `workflowName` moved to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Agent Schema Evolution**: Systematic field renaming across all agents (`agentName` \u2192 `name`, `model` \u2192 `modelDeploymentName`, `tools` \u2192 `toolReferences`)
- **Constraint Specification Loss**: Removal of `expectedOutput` fields and flattening of `task` containers

### Major Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Requires comprehensive updates to all dependent orchestration systems
- **Governance Degradation**: Loss of explicit output expectations reduces validation enforceability
- **Integration Impact**: Breaking path changes will affect existing API consumers and automation tools

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status: Requires Comprehensive Migration**
- High structural impact necessitates coordinated system-wide updates
- Semantic preservation enables functional continuity with proper migration planning
- Governance controls require redesign to maintain validation capabilities

---

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

### Identifier Changes
| Attribute | AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Impact |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Workflow ID** | `workflowId: 392` | `workFlowDetail.id: 4535` | Breaking path change + ID evolution |
| **Workflow Name** | `workflowName: \"DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Conversion\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"DI INFA To PySpark Conversion\"` | Breaking path change + naming standardization |

### Structural Evolution
- **Container Architecture**: Introduction of `workFlowDetail` container for workflow metadata
- **Agent Organization**: `nodes` array replaced with `workflowAgents` array
- **Hierarchical Design**: Flat structure evolved to nested, domain-separated organization

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Access Pattern**: Changed from `workflow.nodes[i]` to `workflow.workflowAgents[i]`
- **Workflow Metadata Access**: Changed from `workflow.workflowId` to `workflow.workFlowDetail.id`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Complete breaking changes require orchestration system updates

### Governance Implications
- **Enhanced Identification**: Introduction of explicit `agentId` fields improves agent tracking
- **Reduced Constraints**: Loss of `expectedOutput` specifications weakens validation controls
- **Model Governance**: `modelDeploymentName` provides more explicit model version management
