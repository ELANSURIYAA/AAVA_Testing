PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:


Integers only


Every deduction must be justified using agent or field evidence


Structural similarity must heavily penalize breaking reorganization


PRIMARY OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 TXT REPORT (MANDATORY)


Your primary output must be a human-readable .txt ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt.

SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence


CSV persistence for automation


\u200b


\u200bPersistent Output Requirement (GitHub Storage) (IMPORTANT)


After completing your assigned task (TXT REPORT), you must:


Generate the final file content in the required format


Use the runtime GitHub parameters provided to you


Upload the file using the GitHub File Writer Tool


This prompt supports any file format (.csv, .txt, .json, .md, etc.).


Formatting rules depend on the task requirements and/or file type provided at runtime.\u200b


\u200b\u200b


When CSV output is required, you must still include the entire analytical content of the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt, even though the schema is constrained.


CSV DESIGN PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT)


CSV is NOT a summary


Every paragraph, table row, and analysis point in the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt MUST appear as one or more CSV rows


TXT \u2192 CSV must be a lossless transformation


Each logical finding = one CSV row


Issue taxonomy enforces depth and auditability

## Sql Server to DBT Converter Workflow Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overall Alignment Assessment:**
AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization while maintaining complete semantic preservation of all agent functionalities. The migration represents a breaking architectural change with high operational impact but preserves core business logic integrity.

**High-Impact Changes:**
- Complete structural reorganization from flat to nested workflow container
- Workflow identifier path changes requiring system-wide updates  
- Agent container renamed from \"nodes\" to \"workflowAgents\"
- Model upgrades across all agents from gpt-4o to gpt-4.1
- Removal of expectedOutput constraints across all agents

**Major Risks:**
- Breaking changes require coordinated migration across dependent systems
- Loss of expectedOutput specifications weakens governance enforcement
- Model version changes may introduce behavioral variance
- Path-dependent integrations will fail without updates

**Migration Readiness Assessment:**
Requires comprehensive structural migration with high coordination complexity. Not production-ready without extensive integration updates.

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

| **Attribute** | **AAVA 1.0** | **AAVA 2.0** | **Impact** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Identifier** | `workflowId: 1068` | `workFlowDetail.id: 3812` | Breaking path change |
| **Name** | `workflowName: \"Sql Server to DBT Converter\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"Sql Server to DBT Converter\"` | Breaking path change |
| **Container** | `nodes: [...]` | `workflowAgents: [...]` | Breaking container rename |
| **Structure** | Flat root-level attributes | Nested `workFlowDetail` container | Major architectural change |

**Orchestration Differences:**
- Agent array structure preserved but relocated
- Agent ordering maintained consistently
- No changes to agent execution sequence

**Backward Compatibility Impact:**
- Complete breaking compatibility requiring migration scripts
- All workflow references must be updated
- Orchestration systems require container name updates

- Path-dependent integration rewrites

### **Validation Enforceability:**
**Degraded** - Critical loss of `expectedOutput` specifications:
- No explicit output format validation
- Reduced automated quality assurance
- Loss of contract-based agent behavior enforcement

### **Traceability Impact:**
**Mixed Impact:**
- **Improved:** Addition of unique `agentId` fields enhances agent tracking
- **Degraded:** Loss of expectedOutput reduces execution traceability
- **Breaking:** Workflow ID path changes break existing trace references

### **Governance Degradation/Improvement:**
**Net Degradation:**
- **Improvement:** Enhanced agent identification with unique IDs
- **Degradation:** Complete removal of output format governance
- **Risk:** Weakened validation and audit capabilities

---

## 7. Risk Assessment

### **Execution Risks:**
- **Model Variance:** gpt-4.1 upgrade may produce different outputs than gpt-4o
- **Reference Failures:** Breaking path changes will cause integration failures
- **Validation Loss:** Removal of expectedOutput eliminates automated quality checks

### **Tooling Risks:**
- **Orchestration Failure:** Container rename requires tool updates
- **Monitoring Gaps:** Workflow ID changes break existing monitoring
- **Integration Breaks:** All dependent systems require migration

### **Model Behavior Risks:**
- **Output Variance:** gpt-4.1 may generate different response patterns
- **Performance Changes:** New model version may have different latency/cost characteristics
- **Compatibility Issues:** Downstream systems expecting gpt-4o outputs may fail

### **Downstream Integration Risks:**
- **Breaking Dependencies:** All workflow references must be updated simultaneously
- **Data Pipeline Failures:** ETL processes expecting old structure will break
- **Audit Trail Loss:** Historical references to old workflow IDs become invalid
