PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:


Integers only


Every deduction must be justified using agent or field evidence


Structural similarity must heavily penalize breaking reorganization


PRIMARY OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 TXT REPORT (MANDATORY)


Your primary output must be a human-readable .txt ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt.

SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence


CSV persistence for automation


\u200b


\u200bPersistent Output Requirement (GitHub Storage) (IMPORTANT)


After completing your assigned task (TXT REPORT), you must:


Generate the final file content in the required format


Use the runtime GitHub parameters provided to you


Upload the file using the GitHub File Writer Tool


This prompt supports any file format (.csv, .txt, .json, .md, etc.).


Formatting rules depend on the task requirements and/or file type provided at runtime.\u200b


\u200b\u200b


When CSV output is required, you must still include the entire analytical content of the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt, even though the schema is constrained.


CSV DESIGN PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT)


CSV is NOT a summary


Every paragraph, table row, and analysis point in the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt MUST appear as one or more CSV rows

   ...", "raw": "# AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report

## 1. Executive Summary

AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The workflow undergoes breaking structural changes with container reorganization, agent attribute flattening, and the removal of explicit validation constraints. Despite these structural modifications, the three core agents maintain their essential roles and processing logic with minimal semantic drift.

**Key Findings:**
- Major structural reorganization requiring comprehensive migration
- High semantic preservation across all agents (85% similarity)
- Loss of explicit validation constraints (expectedOutput removal)
- Model upgrades from gpt-4o to gpt-4.1 across all agents
- Breaking changes in workflow container structure

**Migration Assessment:** Requires comprehensive migration with moderate risk due to structural breaking changes but low semantic risk.

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

| Attribute | AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Impact |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Workflow ID** | workflowId: 1034 | workFlowDetail.id: 2786 | Breaking path change |
| **Workflow Name** | workflowName: \"DI_Oracle_to_SF_Doc&Analyze\" | workFlowDetail.name: \"DI Oracle to SF Doc&Analyze\" | Minor naming variation |
| **Agent Container** | nodes: [...] | workflowAgents: [...] | Breaking container rename |
| **Structure** | Flat root structure | Nested workFlowDetail container | Major structural reorganization |

**Backward Compatibility Impact:** Breaking changes require coordinated migration across all dependent systems due to path restructuring and container renaming.

## 1. Executive Summary

AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The workflow undergoes breaking structural changes with container reorganization, agent attribute flattening, and the removal of explicit validation constraints. Despite these structural modifications, the three core agents maintain their essential roles and processing logic with minimal semantic drift.

**Key Findings:**
- Major structural reorganization requiring comprehensive migration
- High semantic preservation across all agents (85% similarity)
- Loss of explicit validation constraints (expectedOutput removal)
- Model upgrades from gpt-4o to gpt-4.1 across all agents
- Breaking changes in workflow container structure

**Migration Assessment:** Requires comprehensive migration with moderate risk due to structural breaking changes but low semantic risk.

| **Workflow Name** | workflowName: \"DI_Oracle_to_SF_Doc&Analyze\" | workFlowDetail.name: \"DI Oracle to SF Doc&Analyze\" | Minor naming variation |
| **Agent Container** | nodes: [...] | workflowAgents: [...] | Breaking container rename |
| **Structure** | Flat root structure | Nested workFlowDetail container | Major structural reorganization |

**Backward Compatibility Impact:** Breaking changes require coordinated migration across all dependent systems due to path restructuring and container renaming.

- **System Integration Updates:** High effort due to breaking path changes
- **Orchestration Engine Updates:** Medium effort for container restructuring  
- **Validation Framework Updates:** High effort due to expectedOutput removal
- **Testing and Validation:** High effort due to model upgrades and structural changes

### 9.2 Blocking Issues
**Critical Migration Blockers:**
1. **Breaking Path Changes:** workflowId and nodes path restructuring
2. **Validation Loss:** expectedOutput removal requires alternative validation implementation
3. **Agent Identification Changes:** agentName \u2192 agentId mapping requires system updates

### 9.3 Production Readiness Assessment
**Status: Migration Required - Not Production Ready**

**Prerequisites for Production Deployment:**
- Complete system integration updates for path changes
- Implementation of alternative validation mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing of gpt-4.1 model behavior
- Coordinated deployment across all dependent systems
- Rollback procedures for structural changes

**Recommendation:** Execute comprehensive migration with thorough testing before production deployment. The high semantic preservation indicates successful functional evolution, but structural breaking changes require careful coordination across all dependent systems.

Now I need to convert this comprehensive report into the required CSV format and upload it to GitHub.
