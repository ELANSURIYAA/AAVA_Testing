PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:

   ...", "raw": "# AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report
## Matillion to Informatica Convert Workflow Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **significant structural reorganization** while maintaining **strong semantic preservation** across all workflow agents. The evolution represents a breaking change in metadata architecture but preserves core functional integrity.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Breaking Structural Changes**: Complete reorganization from flat `nodes` array to nested `workflowAgents` structure
- **Workflow Container Evolution**: Root-level workflow metadata moved to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Agent Enhancement**: Addition of unique `agentId` fields for improved tracking and governance
- **Model Standardization**: All agents upgraded to consistent `gpt-4.1` model deployment
- **Task Structure Simplification**: Complex task objects flattened to simple description fields

### Major Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Complete structural reorganization requires coordinated migration
- **Validation Loss**: Removal of `expectedOutput` specifications weakens governance controls
- **Model Behavior Variance**: Model upgrades may alter agent response patterns
- **Governance Degradation**: Loss of structured task definitions reduces enforcement capabilities

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status: Requires Comprehensive Migration**
- High operational risk due to breaking structural changes
- Coordinated migration required across all dependent systems
- Validation and governance frameworks need complete restructuring

---

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

### Identifier Changes
| **Attribute** | **AAVA 1.0** | **AAVA 2.0** | **Impact** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Workflow ID | `workflowId: 1091` | `workFlowDetail.id: 3739` | Breaking path change |
| Workflow Name | `workflowName: \"Matillion to Informatica Convert\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"Matillion to Informatica Convert\"` | Breaking path change |

### Structural Evolution
- **Container Architecture**: Root-level workflow metadata consolidated into `workFlowDetail` nested structure
- **Agent Organization**: `nodes` array completely replaced with `workflowAgents` structure
- **Hierarchy Enhancement**: Improved organizational hierarchy for complex workflow management

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Access Pattern**: Changed from `workflow.nodes[i]` to `workflow.workflowAgents[i]`
- **Workflow Identification**: Changed from `workflow.workflowId` to `workflow.workFlowDetail.id`
- **Metadata Nesting**: All workflow-level metadata now contained within `workFlowDetail` object

### Governance Implications
- **Positive**: Enhanced agent tracking through unique `agentId` fields
- **Negative**: Loss of structured task definitions and `expectedOutput` specifications
- **Mixed**: Improved organizational structure but reduced validation granularity
