Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact

Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:


Integers only


Every deduction must be justified using agent or field evidence


Structural similarity must heavily penalize breaking reorganization


PRIMARY OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 TXT REPORT (MANDATORY)


Your primary output must be a human-readable .txt ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt.

Remember the text ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt generated should be neat. Use Tables and present every details neat.\u200b\u200b


SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence


CSV persistence for automation


\u200b


\u200bPersistent Output Requirement (GitHub Storage) (IMPORTANT)


After completing your assigned task (TXT REPORT), you must:


Generate the final file content in the required format


Use the runtime GitHub parameters provided to you


Upload the file using the GitHub File Writer Tool


This prompt supports any file format (.csv, .txt, .json, .md, etc.).


Formatting rules depend on the task requirements and/or file type provided at runtime.\u200b


\u200b\u200b


When CSV output is required, you must still include the entire analytical content of the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt, even though the schema is constrained.


CSV DESIGN PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT)


CSV is NOT a summary


Every paragraph, table row, and analysis point in the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt MUST appear as one or more CSV rows


TXT \u2192 CSV must be a lossless transformation


Each logical finding = one CSV row


Issue taxonomy enforces depth and auditability

Input 1:
   ...", "raw": "# AAVA 1.0 to AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **breaking structural changes** while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The evolution represents a significant architectural shift from a flat workflow structure to a nested, hierarchical organization that enhances metadata management but requires comprehensive migration planning.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Complete workflow container restructuring**: Migration from root-level attributes to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Agent array reorganization**: `nodes` renamed to `workflowAgents` with enhanced agent identification
- **Model modernization**: Uniform upgrade from `gpt-4` to `gpt-4.1` across all agents
- **Governance constraint reduction**: Removal of `expectedOutput` specifications and structured `task` objects

### Major Risks
- **Breaking orchestration changes** requiring system-wide coordination
- **Loss of validation enforcement** through removed `expectedOutput` constraints
- **Tool integration uncertainty** due to empty `toolReferences` arrays
- **Model behavior variance** risk from version upgrades

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status**: Requires comprehensive structural migration with high operational complexity. The changes are not backward compatible and demand coordinated updates across all dependent systems.

---

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

### Identifier Changes
| AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Impact |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `workflowId: 7758` | `workFlowDetail.id: 2481` | **BREAKING**: Path change requires orchestration updates |
| `workflowName: \"DI_Datastage_To_DBT_Doc&Anayze\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"DI Datastage To DBT Doc&Anayze\"` | **BREAKING**: Path change + name formatting |

### Structural Evolution
- **Container Reorganization**: Root-level workflow metadata moved into nested `workFlowDetail` object
- **Agent Array Rename**: `nodes` \u2192 `workflowAgents` with semantic preservation
- **Enhanced Agent Identification**: Addition of `agentId` fields for improved tracking

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Discovery**: Systems must update from `nodes[i]` to `workflowAgents[i]` iteration
- **Workflow Access**: Systems must update from `workflowId` to `workFlowDetail.id` access patterns
- **Metadata Parsing**: Complete restructuring of workflow metadata access patterns

### Backward Compatibility Impact
**BREAKING CHANGES**: All workflow-level access patterns require migration. No backward compatibility maintained.

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **breaking structural changes** while preserving core agent semantics and functionality. The evolution represents a significant architectural shift from a flat workflow structure to a nested, hierarchical organization that enhances metadata management but requires comprehensive migration planning.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Complete workflow container restructuring**: Migration from root-level attributes to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Agent array reorganization**: `nodes` renamed to `workflowAgents` with enhanced agent identification
- **Model modernization**: Uniform upgrade from `gpt-4` to `gpt-4.1` across all agents
- **Governance constraint reduction**: Removal of `expectedOutput` specifications and structured `task` objects

### Major Risks
- **Breaking orchestration changes** requiring system-wide coordination
- **Loss of validation enforcement** through removed `expectedOutput` constraints
- **Tool integration uncertainty** due to empty `toolReferences` arrays
- **Model behavior variance** risk from version upgrades

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status**: Requires comprehensive structural migration with high operational complexity. The changes are not backward compatible and demand coordinated updates across all dependent systems.

- **Agent Array Rename**: `nodes` \u2192 `workflowAgents` with semantic preservation
- **Enhanced Agent Identification**: Addition of `agentId` fields for improved tracking

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Discovery**: Systems must update from `nodes[i]` to `workflowAgents[i]` iteration
- **Workflow Access**: Systems must update from `workflowId` to `workFlowDetail.id` access patterns
- **Metadata Parsing**: Complete restructuring of workflow metadata access patterns

### Backward Compatibility Impact
**BREAKING CHANGES**: All workflow-level access patterns require migration. No backward compatibility maintained.
