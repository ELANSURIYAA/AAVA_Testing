PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d

4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change

They represent different versions of the same workflow system.


PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)


You must perform mandatory comparison at ALL THREE LEVELS:


Workflow-Level Metadata


Agent-Level Metadata


Field-Level Metadata (within each agent)


Any output missing explicit agent-level or field-level analysis is invalid.


SCOPE (IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT)


You must NOT:


Analyze JSON syntax


Discuss parsing correctness


Discuss object trees as JSON


Mention \u201cvalid JSON\u201d, \u201csyntax correctness\u201d, or \u201corphaned JSON nodes\u201d


You MUST:


Treat metadata as a logical model, not a JSON artifact


Focus on semantic, structural, and governance evolution


REQUIRED ANALYSIS DEPTH


1. WORKFLOW-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


Explicitly compare:


Workflow identifiers


Workflow names


Versioning patterns


Workflow containers


Agent orchestration


Execution ordering (if implied)


Governance metadata


Backward compatibility impact


You must identify:


Renamed workflow attributes


Moved workflow metadata


Added or removed workflow-level fields


Structural reorganization impact


2. AGENT INVENTORY AND MAPPING (MANDATORY CORE)


You must:


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 1.0


Enumerate all agents in AAVA 2.0


Produce an explicit agent mapping, identifying:


Exact matches


Renamed agents


Added agents


Removed agents


Renames must be justified semantically, not just by name similarity.


3. AGENT-LEVEL METADATA COMPARISON


For each mapped agent, perform a full metadata comparison, including:


id / agentId


name / agentName


description


prompt semantics


inputs


outputs


expectedOutput


tools / toolReferences


model


modelDeploymentName


constraints


metadata


tags


task definitions


ordering


relationships


governance signals


You must explicitly identify:


Added attributes


Removed attributes


Renamed attributes


Model changes


Tooling changes


Constraint changes


Semantic drift


Governance degradation or improvement


4. FIELD-LEVEL (ATTRIBUTE) COMPARISON


For every agent:


Compare each attribute individually


Identify:


Name changes


Type or format changes


Required vs optional changes


Constraint changes


Structural relocation


Loss of explicit expectations (e.g., expectedOutput)


Loss of validation enforceability


5. SCHEMA & GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION


You must assess:


Backward compatibility


Migration complexity


Enforcement loss or gain


Observability and traceability impact


Compliance and audit impact


REQUIRED ISSUE CLASSIFICATION (INTERNAL LOGIC)


Your analysis must internally classify findings using:


executive_summary


semantic_analysis


structural_analysis


schema_evolution


agent_added


agent_removed


agent_renamed


agent_drift


field_change


type_change


constraint_change


missing_metadata


governance_issue


ambiguity


risk


general_finding


(This taxonomy is used later when transforming the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into CSV.)


SCORING (MANDATORY)


You must compute and justify:


Semantic Similarity (0\u2013100)


Structural Similarity (0\u2013100)


Governance Quality Impact (0\u2013100)


Overall Score (0\u2013100)


Rules:


Integers only


Every deduction must be justified using agent or field evidence


Structural similarity must heavily penalize breaking reorganization


PRIMARY OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 TXT REPORT (MANDATORY)


Your primary output must be a human-readable .txt ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt.

SECONDARY OUTPUT (MANDATORY \u2013 INTERNAL)


After generating the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt:


Convert the full ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt into structured CSV


Store it in GitHub using the provided runtime parameters


CSV is NOT user-facing


FAILURE CONDITIONS


Missing agent mapping


Missing field-level comparison


Generic or shallow analysis


Inclusion of JSON syntax/validation discussion


Summary-only output


SUCCESS CRITERIA


A successful execution produces:


A deep, professional TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt


Full workflow + agent + field coverage


Migration-ready intelligence


CSV persistence for automation


\u200b


\u200bPersistent Output Requirement (GitHub Storage) (IMPORTANT)


After completing your assigned task (TXT REPORT), you must:


Generate the final file content in the required format


Use the runtime GitHub parameters provided to you


Upload the file using the GitHub File Writer Tool


This prompt supports any file format (.csv, .txt, .json, .md, etc.).


Formatting rules depend on the task requirements and/or file type provided at runtime.\u200b


\u200b\u200b


When CSV output is required, you must still include the entire analytical content of the ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt, even though the schema is constrained.


CSV DESIGN PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT)


CSV is NOT a summary


Every paragraph, table row, and analysis point in the TXT ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt MUST appear as one or more CSV rows


TXT \u2192 CSV must be a lossless transformation


Each logical finding = one CSV row


Issue taxonomy enforces depth and auditability

   ...", "raw": "# AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report
## Postgres_to_Pyspark_Convert Workflow Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **significant structural reorganization** while maintaining **complete semantic preservation** of core agent functionality. The migration represents a breaking change requiring comprehensive system updates, but preserves all essential business logic and agent capabilities.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Breaking Structural Changes**: Complete reorganization from flat `nodes` array to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Field Renaming**: Systematic replacement of core fields (`agentName` \u2192 `name`, `model` \u2192 `modelDeploymentName`, `tools` \u2192 `toolReferences`)
- **Model Standardization**: All agents upgraded to `gpt-4.1` from mixed versions (`o3-mini`, `gpt-4o`)
- **Metadata Flattening**: Task structure simplified from nested objects to direct description fields
- **Governance Impact**: Loss of `expectedOutput` specifications reduces validation enforcement

### Major Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Breaking structural changes require coordinated updates across all dependent systems
- **Validation Loss**: Removal of `expectedOutput` weakens runtime validation capabilities
- **Model Behavior Variance**: Standardization to `gpt-4.1` may introduce execution pattern changes
- **Integration Failures**: Path changes affect downstream orchestration systems

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status**: Requires comprehensive structural migration
**Effort Level**: High
**Blocking Issues**: Breaking field names and container structure changes
**Production Readiness**: Not ready without coordinated migration plan

---

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

### Identifier Changes
| Attribute | AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Impact |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Workflow ID** | `workflowId: 776` | `workFlowDetail.id: 3807` | Breaking path change |
| **Workflow Name** | `workflowName: \"Postgres_to_Pyspark_Convert\"` | `workFlowDetail.name: \"Postgres to Pyspark Convert\"` | Breaking path change + cosmetic naming |

### Structural Evolution
| Component | AAVA 1.0 Structure | AAVA 2.0 Structure | Migration Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Root Container** | Flat structure with direct fields | Nested `workFlowDetail` container | Breaking reorganization |
| **Agent Container** | `nodes` array | `workflowAgents` array | Breaking field rename |
| **Nesting Level** | Single level | Two-level nesting | Increased complexity |

### Orchestration Differences
- **Agent Access Path**: `nodes[i]` \u2192 `workflowAgents[i]` (breaking change)
- **Workflow Metadata Access**: Direct fields \u2192 `workFlowDetail.*` (breaking change)
- **Agent Identification**: No explicit IDs \u2192 `agentId` field added (improvement)

### Governance Implications
- **Positive**: Addition of `agentId` improves tracking and management
- **Negative**: Loss of `expectedOutput` reduces validation enforcement
- **Neutral**: Structural reorganization requires updated governance tooling

## 9. Migration Readiness Statement

### Required Migration Effort
**Effort Level**: Comprehensive (High)
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for coordinated migration
**Resource Requirements**: Full development team engagement

**Migration Tasks**:
1. **Schema Updates** (2 weeks): Update all field references and path access patterns
2. **System Integration** (2 weeks): Modify orchestration, monitoring, and governance systems
3. **Testing & Validation** (1-2 weeks): Comprehensive testing of model behavior changes
4. **Deployment Coordination** (1 week): Coordinated rollout across all dependent systems

### Blocking Issues
1. **Breaking Field Changes**: All systems accessing agent metadata require updates
2. **Path Restructuring**: Workflow access patterns need comprehensive revision
3. **Validation Loss**: Alternative validation mechanisms must be implemented
4. **Model Behavior**: gpt-4.1 standardization requires behavior validation

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Status**: \u274c Not Ready for Production

**Prerequisites for Production Deployment**:
1. \u2705 Complete field mapping documentation
2. \u274c Updated orchestration systems
3. \u274c Alternative validation mechanisms
4. \u274c Model behavior validation
5. \u274c Coordinated migration plan
6. \u274c Rollback procedures

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Alignment Assessment
AAVA 2.0 introduces **significant structural reorganization** while maintaining **complete semantic preservation** of core agent functionality. The migration represents a breaking change requiring comprehensive system updates, but preserves all essential business logic and agent capabilities.

### High-Impact Changes
- **Breaking Structural Changes**: Complete reorganization from flat `nodes` array to nested `workFlowDetail` container
- **Field Renaming**: Systematic replacement of core fields (`agentName` \u2192 `name`, `model` \u2192 `modelDeploymentName`, `tools` \u2192 `toolReferences`)
- **Model Standardization**: All agents upgraded to `gpt-4.1` from mixed versions (`o3-mini`, `gpt-4o`)
- **Metadata Flattening**: Task structure simplified from nested objects to direct description fields
- **Governance Impact**: Loss of `expectedOutput` specifications reduces validation enforcement

### Major Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Breaking structural changes require coordinated updates across all dependent systems
- **Validation Loss**: Removal of `expectedOutput` weakens runtime validation capabilities
- **Model Behavior Variance**: Standardization to `gpt-4.1` may introduce execution pattern changes
- **Integration Failures**: Path changes affect downstream orchestration systems

### Migration Readiness Assessment
**Status**: Requires comprehensive structural migration
**Effort Level**: High
**Blocking Issues**: Breaking field names and container structure changes
**Production Readiness**: Not ready without coordinated migration plan

## 6. Schema & Governance Evolution

### Migration Complexity
**Level**: High
**Reasons**:
- Complete structural reorganization requires coordinated updates
- Breaking field name changes affect all dependent systems
- Path changes require updated orchestration logic
- Model upgrades may require behavior validation

**Migration Requirements**:
1. Update all field references (`agentName` \u2192 `name`, `model` \u2192 `modelDeploymentName`, etc.)
2. Modify path access patterns (`workflowId` \u2192 `workFlowDetail.id`)
3. Update agent array access (`nodes` \u2192 `workflowAgents`)
4. Restructure task metadata handling
5. Implement agentId-based tracking systems
6. Validate model behavior changes

### Validation Enforceability
| Aspect | AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Impact |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Expected Output Validation** | \u2705 Explicit specifications | \u274c Not present | Significant governance loss |
| **Task Structure Validation** | \u2705 Nested task objects | \u26a0\ufe0f Flattened structure | Reduced metadata validation |
| **Agent Identification** | \u26a0\ufe0f Name-based only | \u2705 ID-based tracking | Improved identification |
| **Model Consistency** | \u26a0\ufe0f Mixed versions | \u2705 Standardized gpt-4.1 | Improved consistency |

### Traceability Impact
**Positive Changes**:
- Addition of `agentId` enables better agent tracking
- Standardized model versions improve consistency
- Cleaner naming conventions enhance readability

**Negative Changes**:
- Loss of `expectedOutput` reduces validation traceability
- Flattened task structure reduces metadata granularity
- Breaking path changes affect audit trails

## 9. Migration Readiness Statement

### Required Migration Effort
**Effort Level**: Comprehensive (High)
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for coordinated migration
**Resource Requirements**: Full development team engagement

**Migration Tasks**:
1. **Schema Updates** (2 weeks): Update all field references and path access patterns
2. **System Integration** (2 weeks): Modify orchestration, monitoring, and governance systems
3. **Testing & Validation** (1-2 weeks): Comprehensive testing of model behavior changes
4. **Deployment Coordination** (1 week): Coordinated rollout across all dependent systems

### Blocking Issues
1. **Breaking Field Changes**: All systems accessing agent metadata require updates
2. **Path Restructuring**: Workflow access patterns need comprehensive revision
3. **Validation Loss**: Alternative validation mechanisms must be implemented
4. **Model Behavior**: gpt-4.1 standardization requires behavior validation

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Status**: \u274c Not Ready for Production

**Prerequisites for Production Deployment**:
1. \u2705 Complete field mapping documentation
2. \u274c Updated orchestration systems
3. \u274c Alternative validation mechanisms
4. \u274c Model behavior validation
5. \u274c Coordinated migration plan
6. \u274c Rollback procedures

**Recommendation**: Proceed with migration planning and system updates before production deployment. The semantic preservation is excellent, but structural changes require careful coordination to avoid system failures.
