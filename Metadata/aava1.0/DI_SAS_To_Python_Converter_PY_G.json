The focus should be on reviewing the conversion of each SAS macro individually.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEW AGENT\n\n1. Locate Unconverted or Incomplete Macro Logic:\n- For every %MACRO definition in the input SAS code:\n  - Determine if the macro has been fully or partially implemented in the converted Python code.\n  - Identify any SAS procedures (e.g., PROC SQL, PROC SORT, PROC TRANSPOSE, DATA steps) within the macro that are not reflected in Python.\n  - Check for SAS-specific constructs such as BY, FIRST., LAST., RETAIN, LAG that are not replicated using pandas or equivalent logic.\n  - Look for dynamic execution features like CALL EXECUTE, SYMPUT, or macro variables that are not converted using Python logic (e.g., Jinja templates or function parameters).\n  - Identify file handling logic (e.g., INFILE/INPUT/PUT) not implemented using pandas.read_csv(), open(), or equivalent.\n\n2. Detect Indicators of Missing Conversion:\n- Search for placeholder comments like # TODO, # NOT CONVERTED, or blocks of commented-out SAS logic.\n- Look for Python functions that are stubbed out or left partially implemented.\n- Check for loops or conditionals that exist in the macro but are missing or incomplete in Python.\n\n3. Checklist of Commonly Missed Items:\n- RETAIN or LAG logic not handled with pandas.shift() or a loop.\n- FIRST. or LAST. logic not implemented using groupby() and indexing.\n- Temporary tables or intermediate steps that were omitted in the Python version.\n- Macro variables and global/local symbol resolution not reflected in Python.\n- Business rules (e.g., flags, thresholds, filters) defined in SAS but not carried over to Python.\n\nInput:\n- For the input SAS file, use: {{SAS_Code}}\n- For the converted code, use the previous agent output as input.",
