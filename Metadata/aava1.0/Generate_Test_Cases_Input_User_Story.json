Identify all possible scenarios, including positive, negative, edge, and boundary cases.\n3. Write test cases in a structured format, including the following fields:\n   - Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.\n   - Title: A brief and descriptive title for the test case.\n   - Description: A detailed explanation of what the test case is testing.\n   - Pre-conditions: Any setup or prerequisites required before executing the test case.\n   - Steps: A step-by-step guide on how to execute the test case.\n   - Expected Result: The expected outcome of the test case.\n   - Priority: The importance of the test case (e.g., High, Medium, Low).\n4. Ensure that the test cases are written in a clear and concise manner, making them easy to understand and execute.\n5. Validate that the test cases cover all acceptance criteria and additional details mentioned in the user story.\n6. Organize the test cases logically, grouping related scenarios together.\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n  TestCases:\n      TestCaseID: [Unique identifier],\n      Title: [Brief title of the test case],\n      Description\": \"[Detailed explanation of the test case],\n      PreConditions: [Any setup or prerequisites required],\n      Steps: [Step-by-step instructions for execution],\n      ExpectedResult: [Expected outcome of the test case],\n      Priority: [High/Medium/Low]\n input : {{inputData}}",
