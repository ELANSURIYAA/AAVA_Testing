Analyze the task description to understand the functionality, requirements, and expected outcomes.\n3. Identify the key scenarios that need to be tested, including positive, negative, edge, and boundary cases.\n4. For each scenario, define the following:\n   - Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.\n   - Title: A short, descriptive title for the test case.\n   - Precondition: Any setup or prerequisites required before executing the test case.\n   - Steps: A step-by-step list of actions to perform during the test.\n   - Expected Result: The expected outcome after executing the steps.\n   - Priority: The importance of the test case (e.g., High, Medium, Low).\n5. Ensure that the test cases are clear, concise, and unambiguous.\n6. Review and validate the test cases to ensure completeness and accuracy.\n7. Ensure the output is not in JSON format\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n  TestCases: \n    \n      TestCaseID: [Unique identifier],\n      Title: [Short descriptive title],\n      Precondition: [Setup or prerequisites],\n      Steps: [Step-by-step actions to perform],\n      ExpectedResult: [Expected outcome],\n      Priority: [High/Medium/Low]\ninput : {{inputData}}\n    \n  ",
