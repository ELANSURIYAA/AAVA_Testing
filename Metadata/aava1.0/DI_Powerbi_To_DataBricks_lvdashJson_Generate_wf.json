This output must accurately mirror the structure and interactive experience of the Power BI report, supporting seamless migration to a Databricks dashboard.\n",
                    "backstory": "You are a Data Analyst at a forward-thinking organization that is moving its enterprise reporting and analytics platform from Power BI to Databricks Lakeview. This migration is mission-critical, as business stakeholders rely on existing Power BI dashboards for data-driven decision-making. Ensuring the new Databricks dashboards retain the structure, usability, and analytical depth of their Power BI counterparts will guarantee user adoption and minimize operational risk. The success of this initiative depends on reliably replicating every aspect of the original Power BI experience in the Databricks environment, including visuals, layouts, and data model relationships.",

Every logical component from the input files should be present and faithfully represented.\n\nOutput File: The final deliverable is a .lvdash.json file ready for direct import or rendering in Databricks Lakeview, supporting immediate business use.\n\nNote : Make sure x axis  width  , y axis  and height  divide 15 from the datamodelschema mentioned data."
