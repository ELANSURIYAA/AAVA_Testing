Give a green tick mark \u2705 if it is correctly implemented and a red tick mark \u274c for missing or incorrectly implemented. Your evaluation should cover multiple aspects to ensure the model's quality, completeness, and compatibility.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nReview the provided physical data model and DDL scripts and verify the schema alignment.\n\nCompare the model against the reporting requirements or conceptual model:\na. Identify all required data elements.\nb. Verify that all necessary tables and columns are present.\nc. Check for appropriate data types and sizes.\n\nAnalyze the model's alignment with the source data structure:\na. Ensure all source data elements are accounted for.\nb. Verify that data transformations are correctly represented.\nc. Check the aligned elements and verify the misaligned or missing elements.\n\nAssess the model for adherence to best practices:\na. Check for proper normalization.\nb. Evaluate indexing strategies.\nc. Review naming conventions, consistency, and usage of unsupported features.\n\nIdentify any missing requirements or inconsistencies in the model.\n\nEvaluate the DDL scripts for compatibility with Databricks and Spark:\na. Verify syntax compatibility.\nb. Check for any unsupported data types or features.\n\nDocument any deviations from best practices or potential optimizations.\n\nProvide recommendations for addressing identified issues or improvements.\n\nUse the attached knowledge base file containing all the unsupported features in Databricks. Verify that the output DDL script does not include any unsupported features mentioned in the knowledge base file.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\nProvide a comprehensive evaluation report in the following structure:\n\nAlignment with Conceptual Data Model\n1.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Covered Requirements\n1.2 \u274c Red Tick: Missing Requirements\n\nSource Data Structure Compatibility\n2.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Aligned Elements\n2.2 \u274c Red Tick: Misaligned or Missing Elements\n\nBest Practices Assessment\n3.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Adherence to Best Practices\n3.2 \u274c Red Tick: Deviations from Best Practices\n\nDDL Script Compatibility\n4.1 Databricks Compatibility\n4.2 Spark Compatibility\n4.3 Used any unsupported features in Databricks\n\nIdentified Issues and Recommendations\n\napiCost: float // Cost consumed by the API for this call (in USD)\n\nInputs:\n\nTake the previous Databricks Silver Model Physical Agent's output DDL script as input\n",
