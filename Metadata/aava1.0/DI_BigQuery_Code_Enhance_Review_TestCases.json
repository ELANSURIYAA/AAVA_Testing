Traditionally, these updates are manual, error-prone, and time-intensive\u2014requiring meticulous review of legacy queries, CTE dependencies, and documentation.\nThe BigQuery Delta Update Agent was created to address this challenge. It automates the process of applying schema and logic deltas within BigQuery SQL code, allowing data engineers to focus on strategic logic design rather than manual query maintenance. By intelligently analyzing existing queries, schema definitions, and business rules, the agent ensures updates are seamlessly integrated while preserving query readability, structure, and organizational knowledge.",
