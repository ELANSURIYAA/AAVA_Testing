It enables replication of Synapse procedural logic using standard SQL constructs and Delta Lake operations.\n\nThe goal is to accurately replicate the stored procedure logic from Azure Synapse using Fabric SQL code.\n\nScope and Constraints:\n\nConvert all key Synapse constructs, such as:\n\nVariable Assignments / DECLARE / SET: Use Fabric SQL variable declarations or expressions in procedural SQL blocks.\n\nConditional Logic (IF / CASE): Use Fabric SQL IF / ELSE or CASE statements as appropriate.\n\nJoins: Use standard SQL JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER).\n\nAggregations: Use GROUP BY with aggregation functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.\n\nInsert / Update / Merge: Use Fabric SQL INSERT, UPDATE, or MERGE statements, leveraging Delta table transactional support where applicable.\n\nCode should be optimized for Fabric SQL execution on Lakehouse or Warehouse.\n\nProcess Steps to Follow:\n\nStep 1: Parse and extract procedural logic from the Synapse stored procedure.\nStep 2: Map each T-SQL construct to the equivalent Fabric SQL operation or expression.\nStep 3: Use standard SQL queries or Delta table operations where appropriate.\nStep 4: Assemble code into modular, readable SQL scripts or Fabric notebooks.\nStep 5: Validate output results against the original stored procedure logic.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nA complete Fabric SQL script executable in a Fabric environment.\n\nUse standard SQL syntax and Delta table operations for all data manipulations.\n\nQuality Criteria:\n\nFunctional, modular Fabric SQL code with accurate business logic translation.\n\nClear inline comments and adherence to Fabric SQL best practices.\n\nCorrect handling of NULLs, data types, and edge cases.\n\nEnsure compatibility with Fabric runtime and Delta Lake engine.\n\nOptimize Performance:\n\nMinimize unnecessary shuffles, joins, or wide transformations.\n\nUse broadcast joins or caching when beneficial.\n\nUse Delta tables for efficient insert/update/merge operations.\n\nInput Files:\nAzure Synapse stored procedure file: {{Synapse_code}}\n\nExpected Output:\n\nFully working Fabric SQL code.\n\nSource and target table operations implemented using SQL statements and Delta table operations.\n\nAPI Cost Consumption:\nExplicitly mention the cost consumed by the API for this call in the output.\nThe cost should be reported as a floating-point value with currency explicitly mentioned as USD (e.g., apiCost: 0.0047 USD).\nEnsure the cost consumed by the API includes all decimal values.",

Your objective is to ensure that the converted Fabric SQL code accurately replicates the logic and intent of the original stored procedures while leveraging Fabric SQL distributed processing, integration, and performance features.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nAnalyze the original Synapse stored procedure structure and data flow.\n\nReview the corresponding Fabric SQL code for each stored procedure.\n\nVerify that all data sources, joins, and destinations are correctly mapped in Fabric SQL.\n\nEnsure that all SQL transformations, aggregations, and business logic are accurately implemented in the Fabric SQL code (including any UDFs, scripting logic, or dataflow equivalents).\n\nCheck for proper error handling, exception management, and logging mechanisms in the Fabric SQL implementation.\n\nValidate that the Fabric SQL code follows best practices for query optimization and performance (e.g., appropriate use of partitioned/clustered tables, caching, materialized views, and optimized UDF usage).\n\nIdentify any potential improvements or optimization opportunities in the converted Fabric SQL logic.\n\nTest the Fabric SQL code with representative sample datasets to validate correctness.\n\nCompare the output of the Fabric SQL implementation with the original Synapse stored procedure output.\n\nINPUT:\n- For the input Synapse stored procedure file, use: {{Synapse_code}}\n/*Also take the output of the \"DI_SynapseToFabric\" agent\u2019s converted Fabric code as input.*/\n\n\n\n",
