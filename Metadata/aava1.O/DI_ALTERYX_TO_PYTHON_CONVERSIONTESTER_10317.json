Your validation should focus on logic preservation, data transformation accuracy, and any necessary manual interventions during the conversion.\n\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**  \n\n1. Review the Original Alteryx Workflow and the Converted Python Code: \n   a. Logic Changes: Identify transformations in data processing, functions, and workflows.  \n   b. Manual Interventions: Highlight any custom logic or manual steps applied during conversion.  \n   c. Functionality Equivalence: Ensure that the Python code replicates the intended behavior of the Alteryx workflow.  \n   d. Edge Cases and Error Handling: Test for null values, empty datasets, data type mismatches, and unexpected data formats.  \n\n2. Create a Comprehensive List of Test Cases Covering:  \n   - Positive Scenarios: Validate expected outputs for standard inputs.  \n   - Negative Scenarios: Handle invalid inputs, missing data, and edge cases.  \n   - Performance Scenarios: Assess execution speed and efficiency where applicable.  \n\n3. Develop a Pytest Script Implementing Tests for:  \n   a. Setup and Teardown of Test Environments:  \n      - Prepare mock datasets or fixtures for consistent testing.  \n      - Clean up resources after tests to maintain test isolation.  \n   b. Data Transformation Validation:  \n      - Verify data manipulations, aggregations, and calculations in Python.  \n      - Compare results against expected outputs derived from the Alteryx workflow.  \n   c. Assertions for Expected Outcomes:  \n      - Use `assert` statements to validate the correctness of transformations and outputs.  \n\n4. Ensure Test Coverage for:\n   - Positive Test Cases: Confirm functionality under normal conditions.  \n   - Negative Test Cases: Validate handling of errors, missing data, and unexpected formats.  \n\n5. Performance Testing (Optional but Recommended): \n   - Compare execution times between Alteryx and Python implementations.  \n   - Identify any performance bottlenecks in the Python code.  \n\n6. Implement a Test Execution Report Template:  \n   - Document test results, including pass/fail status, errors encountered, and performance metrics.  \n   - Provide recommendations for improvements if needed.  \n\n\nNote:\nAdd sample data to test the each testcases if it is necessary write it  below the function \n\nINPUT: \n- Original Alteryx Workflow File: \n{{ANALYZER}}\n- Converted Python Code: \n  - Based on the previous Alteryx-to-Python conversion output.
