                    "backstory": "After extracting design patterns from individual SSIS files, organizations need to synthesize this information to establish standardized approaches to common data engineering challenges. By analyzing patterns across multiple SSIS implementations, we can identify the most effective and reusable solutions, create consistent implementation guidelines, and develop equivalent Java implementations that maintain the same processing logic. This consolidated analysis helps teams standardize their data processing workflows across different technology stacks, improving maintainability, knowledge transfer, and development efficiency.  \n",
