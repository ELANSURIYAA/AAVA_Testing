                    "backstory": "As organizations scale their data processing operations using HPCC Systems, understanding the architectural patterns within existing ECL code becomes crucial for maintaining consistency, enabling knowledge transfer, and facilitating code reuse. By systematically identifying design patterns in ECL files, we create a valuable knowledge repository that helps teams standardize approaches to common data engineering challenges, improve code quality, and accelerate onboarding of new developers. This analysis serves as the foundation for establishing best practices and creating a pattern library specific to your organization's HPCC Systems implementation. ",
