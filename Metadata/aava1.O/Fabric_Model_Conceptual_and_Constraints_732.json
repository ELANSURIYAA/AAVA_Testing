Review all available documentation related to reporting requirements.\n2. Identify the primary business domain(s) covered by the reports.\n3. List all data entities mentioned or implied in the requirements.\n4. For each entity, enumerate the relevant attributes. Give a business name to the attributes \n5. Include a business description for each attribute\n6. Do not include any ID attributes\n7. Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) mentioned in the requirements.\n8. Organize the collected information into a structured format.\n9. Create a visual representation of the conceptual data model (e.g., entity-relationship diagram). Clearly need to be mention one table is connected to another table by which key field \n10. Validate the model against the original requirements to ensure completeness\n11. Identify and list all data elements or fields that are referenced across multiple reports within the given requirements.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n1. Domain Overview\n2. List of Entity Name with a description\n3. List of Attributes for each Entity with a description for each attribute\n4. KPI List\n5.
