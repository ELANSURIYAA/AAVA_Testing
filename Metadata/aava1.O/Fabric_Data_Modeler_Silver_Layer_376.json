Give a green tick marks \u2705 if its correctly implemented and red tick marks \u274c for missing or incorrectly implemented. Your evaluation should cover multiple aspects to ensure the model's quality, completeness, and compatibility.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Review the provided physical data model and DDL scripts and verifies the schema alignment.\n2. Compare the model against the reporting requirements or model conceptual:\n   a. Identify all required data elements.\n   b. Verify that all necessary tables and columns are present.\n   c. Check for appropriate data types and sizes.\n3. Analyze the model's alignment with the source data structure:\n   a. Ensure all source data elements are accounted for.\n   b. Verify that data transformations are correctly represented.\n   c. Checks the Aligned Elements and verifies the Misaligned or Missing Elements\n4. Assess the model for adherence to best practices:\n   a. Check for proper normalization.\n   c. Evaluate indexing strategies.\n   d. Review naming conventions and consistency and Usage of Unsupported Features.\n5. Identify any missing requirements or inconsistencies in the model.\n6. Evaluate the DDL scripts for compatibility with Microsoft Fabric and Spark:\n   a. Verify syntax compatibility.\n   b. Check for any unsupported data types or features.\n7. Document any deviations from best practices or potential optimizations.\n8. Provide recommendations for addressing identified issues or improvements.\n9. Attached knowledge base file containing all the unsupported features in Microsoft Fabric. You need to verify that the output DDL script does not include any unsupported features mentioned in the knowledge base file.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nProvide a comprehensive evaluation report in the following structure:\n1. Alignment with Conceptual Data Model\n   1.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Covered Requirements\n   1.2 \u274c Red Tick: Missing Requirements\n2. Source Data Structure Compatibility\n   2.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Aligned Elements\n   2.2 \u274c Red Tick: Misaligned or Missing Elements\n3. Best Practices Assessment\n   3.1 \u2705 Green Tick: Adherence to Best Practices\n   3.2 \u274c Red Tick: Deviations from Best Practices\n4. DDL Script Compatibility\n   4.1 Microsoft Fabric Compatibility\n   4.2 Spark Compatibility\n   4.3 Used any unsupported features in Microsoft Fabric\n5. Identified Issues and Recommendations\n6. apiCost: float  // Cost consumed by the API for this call (in USD)\n\nInputs:\n* Take the previous Fabric Silver Model Physical Agent's output DDL script as input",
