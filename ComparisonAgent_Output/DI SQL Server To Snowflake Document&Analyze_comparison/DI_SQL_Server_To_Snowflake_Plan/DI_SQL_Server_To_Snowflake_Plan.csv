Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Both agents provide comprehensive SQL Server to Snowflake migration analysis with cost estimation and effort calculation. Agent 1 estimates $0.033 compute cost and 3 hours effort, while Agent 2 estimates $0.90 compute cost and 5.5 hours effort. The outputs show strong semantic alignment (85/100) with similar structural approach (88/100) but differ significantly in cost calculations and data volume assumptions. Both outputs demonstrate high correctness in syntax and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: SQL Server to Snowflake migration cost analysis and effort estimation. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both analyze compute costs based on data volume and warehouse sizing, (2) Both estimate manual fixing effort for syntax conversion, (3) Both include output validation steps, (4) Both provide API cost calculations. Semantic divergences: Agent 1 assumes moderate data size (100MB) while Agent 2 assumes enterprise scale (250GB processed from 2TB+500GB sources). Agent 1 focuses on basic syntax conversion while Agent 2 provides more detailed SQL Server construct removal (TRY...CATCH, OBJECT_ID, GO statements). The fundamental understanding and approach remain aligned despite different scale assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) Header with author/description metadata, (2) Three-section analysis (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing Effort, API Cost), (3) Hierarchical breakdown within each section using bullet points and sub-bullets, (4) Detailed cost calculations with justification, (5) Time estimation breakdowns, (6) Final summary totals. Structural differences: Agent 2 uses more markdown formatting (**bold**) and provides more granular sub-categorization in effort estimation. Agent 1 uses simpler formatting but maintains logical flow. Both use consistent numbering (1, 2, 3) for main sections and similar indentation patterns for sub-items."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-25,"Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-formed calculations and consistent terminology. Minor issues: (1) Line 25 - Storage cost calculation shows ~$3.90/month but uses 100MB/1024MB conversion which should be 100MB/1024/1024MB for TB conversion, (2) Line 35 - Cost estimate formatting could be more consistent with currency notation. All other syntax, mathematical calculations, and internal references are accurate and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 20-30,"Agent 2 shows strong syntactic correctness with detailed calculations and proper markdown formatting. Issues identified: (1) Line 28 - Data volume calculation '10% of data processed (per environment notes)' references undefined 'environment notes', (2) Line 45 - Storage cost calculation uses correct TB conversion, (3) Line 65 - Some inconsistency in effort hour formatting between sections. Mathematical calculations are accurate and internal consistency is maintained throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,Lines 1-100,"Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic accuracy with minor formatting and reference issues. Agent 1 has calculation precision issues while Agent 2 has undefined reference issues, but both maintain internal logical consistency and accurate mathematical computations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-25,"Improve storage cost calculation precision by using correct unit conversions (MB to TB). Standardize currency formatting throughout the document for consistency. Consider adding more detailed breakdown of SQL Server construct handling similar to Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 28,"Remove or clarify undefined reference to 'environment notes' in data volume calculation. Standardize effort hour formatting across all sections. Consider simplifying some of the markdown formatting for better readability in plain text contexts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Standardized cost calculation methodologies and assumptions documentation, (2) Consistent formatting and unit notation, (3) Cross-validation of effort estimates against industry benchmarks, (4) Addition of risk factors and contingency planning in effort estimation."
