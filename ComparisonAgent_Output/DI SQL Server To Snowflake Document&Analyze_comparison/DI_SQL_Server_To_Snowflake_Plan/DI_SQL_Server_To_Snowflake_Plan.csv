Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to Snowflake migration. Agent_1 estimates $0.033 runtime cost and 3.0 hours effort, while Agent_2 estimates $0.90 runtime cost and 5.5 hours effort. The significant differences stem from data volume assumptions and complexity assessments."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake migration costs and effort. They follow identical structural approaches with cost estimation, manual fixes analysis, and API costs. However, Agent_2 provides more detailed data volume analysis (2TB Employee, 500GB Salary tables) while Agent_1 uses moderate assumptions (1M rows, 100MB). Both correctly identify key cost drivers and migration challenges."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"","Both outputs follow nearly identical structure: Author/Description header, Cost Estimation section with compute/storage breakdown, Code Fixing and Testing Effort with manual fixes and validation, and API Cost Calculation. The logical flow and decomposition are virtually the same, with both using bullet points for detailed breakdowns and similar section organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,90,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Agent_1 has minor issues: storage cost calculation shows ~$3.90/month but uses incorrect formula (should be (100MB/1024/1024MB) * $40), and some cost estimates lack precision in warehouse sizing assumptions. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper structure and valid calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 25-30","Agent_2 has excellent syntax and structure with detailed data volume specifications and precise cost calculations. Minor issue with storage cost presentation format but all calculations are mathematically sound and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,"","Average of individual correctness scores: (90 + 95) / 2 = 92.5, rounded to 93"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 15-20","Improve storage cost calculation precision and provide more detailed data volume assumptions for better accuracy"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 25-30","Consider adding more granular warehouse sizing options and include confidence intervals for cost estimates"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs would benefit from including risk factors, alternative scenarios, and sensitivity analysis for cost estimates. Consider standardizing the effort estimation methodology across similar migration projects."
