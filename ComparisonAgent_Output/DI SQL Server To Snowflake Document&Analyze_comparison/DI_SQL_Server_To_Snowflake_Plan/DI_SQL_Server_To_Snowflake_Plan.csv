Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 (Agent_1) vs Lines 1-120 (Agent_2)","Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to Snowflake migration. Agent_1 delivers a concise analysis with moderate data volumes and straightforward calculations, while Agent_2 provides more detailed analysis with larger enterprise-scale data volumes. Both follow similar structural approaches but differ significantly in scope and complexity assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-85 vs Lines 1-120","Both outputs address the same core objective of SQL Server to Snowflake migration cost estimation. They cover identical aspects: runtime cost calculation, manual fixing effort, and API costs. However, Agent_2 assumes significantly larger data volumes (2TB vs 100MB) and provides more granular analysis. The semantic intent is highly aligned but the scale assumptions create notable differences in conclusions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-85 vs Lines 1-120","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Cost Estimation section with compute/storage breakdown, Code Fixing section with manual fixes and validation effort, and API Cost calculation. The logical flow, section headers, and decomposition approach are remarkably similar. Minor differences in subsection organization and bullet point formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Well-formed analysis with consistent calculations. Minor issues: compute cost calculation uses simplified assumptions (1M rows, 100MB) that may not reflect real enterprise scenarios. Storage cost calculation is accurate but presented as ongoing rather than runtime cost. All syntax and references are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 20-35, 60-75","Highly detailed and well-structured analysis with comprehensive cost breakdowns. Enterprise-scale assumptions (2TB, 500GB) are more realistic. Detailed effort estimation with granular time allocations. All calculations are mathematically sound and internally consistent. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with sound mathematical calculations and logical consistency. Agent_2 provides more comprehensive and realistic enterprise-scale analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 45-65","Strengthen analysis by incorporating enterprise-scale data volume assumptions and more detailed effort breakdowns. Consider adding risk factors and mitigation strategies for cost estimation accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 80-100","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding sensitivity analysis for different data volumes and warehouse sizes. Minor formatting standardization would improve readability."
