Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to Snowflake migration. Agent outputs show high semantic alignment in purpose and methodology, with notable structural differences in presentation depth and cost calculation approaches. Both demonstrate strong technical correctness with minor formatting variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs address identical migration analysis goals with similar cost estimation methodologies. Key semantic alignment: both analyze compute costs, storage costs, manual fixes, and validation efforts. Minor divergence in emphasis - DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Document focuses on moderate complexity scenarios while DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Analyze provides more detailed enterprise-scale calculations with specific data volumes (2TB Employee, 500GB Salary tables)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50","Both follow identical three-section structure: 1) Cost Estimation, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort, 3) API Cost. However, structural depth varies significantly. DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Analyze provides more granular cost breakdowns with specific data volume assumptions and detailed warehouse sizing considerations. DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Document uses more generalized scenarios with simplified calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Document,95,"Lines 15-25","Strong technical accuracy in cost calculations and effort estimates. Minor formatting inconsistency in currency notation (~$0.033 vs standard $0.033). All technical concepts, Snowflake pricing models, and migration effort estimates are sound and well-justified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Analyze,98,"Lines 20-35","Excellent technical precision with detailed cost calculations, specific data volume assumptions, and comprehensive warehouse sizing analysis. Consistent formatting throughout. All Snowflake concepts, credit calculations, and effort estimates are technically accurate and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with sound understanding of Snowflake migration complexities, cost structures, and effort estimation methodologies."
