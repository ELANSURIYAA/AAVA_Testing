Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-85,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SQL Server to Snowflake migration analysis covering cost estimation, effort planning, and API costs. Agent 1 estimates ~$0.033 compute cost with 3-hour effort, while Agent 2 estimates $0.73 compute cost with 5-hour effort. Key differences lie in data volume assumptions (100MB vs 2.5TB processed) and complexity assessment, but both follow identical structural organization and address the same core migration planning objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-85,"Both outputs address identical migration planning objectives with similar reasoning frameworks. Agent 1 assumes moderate data volumes (1M rows, 100MB) while Agent 2 assumes enterprise scale (2TB + 500GB tables). Both cover cost estimation, effort planning, and API costs with consistent logical flow. Deduction for different scale assumptions and cost calculation methodologies, but core intent and purpose remain aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-85,"Nearly identical structural organization: same header format (Author: Ascendion AVA+, Description), identical three-section breakdown (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing Effort, API Cost), consistent subsection hierarchy within each section. Minor deduction for slight variation in cost breakdown presentation depth, but overall flow and decomposition approach are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-42,"Syntactically well-formed documentation with consistent internal references, valid mathematical calculations ($0.033 cost estimation), proper section numbering, and coherent logical flow. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-43,"Syntactically well-formed documentation with consistent structure, valid cost calculations ($0.73 estimation), proper mathematical reasoning (250GB/1024GB = 0.244 credits), and coherent presentation. No syntax errors or internal inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with well-formed documentation structure, valid calculations, and consistent internal references. No syntax-level issues identified in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 20-35,"Strong foundation with conservative cost estimates suitable for moderate-scale migrations. Consider expanding data volume scenarios and providing more detailed warehouse sizing guidance for enterprise deployments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 15-40,"Comprehensive enterprise-scale analysis with realistic cost projections. Excellent detail in cost breakdown methodology. Consider adding moderate-scale scenarios for smaller migrations to provide broader applicability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-85,"Both outputs provide solid migration planning frameworks. Recommend combining Agent_1's conservative estimates with Agent_2's enterprise-scale methodology to create comprehensive guidance covering multiple deployment scenarios. Both demonstrate strong technical competency in Snowflake migration planning."
