# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both Agent_Output_1 and Agent_Output_2 provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for SQL Server to Snowflake migration of an employee backup table creation script. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical goals and similar analytical approaches. Structural similarity is excellent (98/100) with matching section organization and flow. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each) with proper formatting and consistent internal references. Key differences lie in cost calculations ($0.033 vs $0.73) and effort estimates (3 vs 5 hours), reflecting different assumptions about data volumes and complexity.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address the identical core objective of estimating Snowflake migration costs and effort for employee backup table creation. They share the same analytical framework covering compute costs, storage costs, manual fixes, and validation effort. Minor semantic differences include: Agent_Output_1 assumes moderate data volumes (1M rows, 100MB) while Agent_Output_2 assumes enterprise-scale data (2TB + 500GB). Both correctly identify key cost drivers (compute resources, data volume, query complexity) and effort factors (syntax conversion, error handling, validation). The fundamental understanding and approach are aligned.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Both outputs follow identical structural organization: 1) Cost Estimation with detailed breakdown, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with manual fixes and validation components, 3) API Cost Calculation. The logical flow, section hierarchy, and decomposition approach are nearly identical. Minor structural differences: Agent_Output_1 uses bullet points for cost breakdown while Agent_Output_2 uses mixed formatting. Both maintain consistent internal organization with clear subsections and systematic progression from cost analysis to effort estimation.

### Correctness

**Agent_Output_1: 100/100**
Agent_Output_1 demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate internal references. All numerical calculations are properly formatted, section headers are consistent, and there are no syntax errors or broken references. The document structure is well-formed with appropriate use of bullet points and clear section delineation.

**Agent_Output_2: 100/100**
Agent_Output_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper document formatting, consistent section structure, and accurate internal references. All cost calculations are properly presented, effort estimates are clearly structured, and there are no syntax errors or formatting issues. The document maintains consistent terminology and proper hierarchical organization.

**Overall: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_Output_1 | Agent_Output_2 | Overall |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **98** | **98** | **98** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_Output_1:**
- Consider providing more detailed data volume assumptions and scaling scenarios to improve cost estimation accuracy for different enterprise contexts.

**For Agent_Output_2:**
- The enterprise-scale assumptions are valuable but could benefit from including smaller-scale scenarios for broader applicability.

**For Both Outputs:**
- Include confidence intervals for cost estimates
- Provide sensitivity analysis for key variables
- Add more specific Snowflake warehouse sizing recommendations
- Include timeline considerations for effort estimates
