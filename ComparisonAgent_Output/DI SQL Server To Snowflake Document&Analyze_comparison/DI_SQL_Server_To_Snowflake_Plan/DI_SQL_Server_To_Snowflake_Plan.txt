# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to Snowflake migration. Agent_1 estimates $0.033 runtime cost and 3.0 hours effort, while Agent_2 estimates $0.90 runtime cost and 5.5 hours effort. The significant differences stem from data volume assumptions and complexity assessments.

**Overall Score: 91/100**

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake migration costs and effort. They follow identical structural approaches with cost estimation, manual fixes analysis, and API costs. However, Agent_2 provides more detailed data volume analysis (2TB Employee, 500GB Salary tables) while Agent_1 uses moderate assumptions (1M rows, 100MB). Both correctly identify key cost drivers and migration challenges.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent_1 assumes moderate data volumes (1M rows, ~100MB)
- Agent_2 provides enterprise-scale assumptions (2TB + 500GB tables)
- Both identify the same migration challenges but with different complexity assessments

### Structural Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structure: Author/Description header, Cost Estimation section with compute/storage breakdown, Code Fixing and Testing Effort with manual fixes and validation, and API Cost Calculation. The logical flow and decomposition are virtually the same, with both using bullet points for detailed breakdowns and similar section organization.

**Structural Elements:**
- Identical section organization
- Consistent use of bullet points and sub-sections
- Same analytical framework and methodology
- Similar presentation of cost breakdowns

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 90/100)**
- Minor issues in storage cost calculation (Lines 15-20, 35-40)
- Storage cost formula appears incorrect: should be (100MB/1024/1024MB) * $40
- Some cost estimates lack precision in warehouse sizing assumptions
- Otherwise syntactically correct with proper structure and valid calculations

**Agent_2 (Score: 95/100)**
- Excellent syntax and structure with detailed data volume specifications (Lines 25-30)
- Precise cost calculations that are mathematically sound and well-documented
- Minor formatting issues in storage cost presentation
- Comprehensive and accurate analysis throughout

**Overall Correctness: 93/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 95 |
| Correctness | 90 | 95 | 93 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **91** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:**
- Improve storage cost calculation precision (Lines 15-20)
- Provide more detailed data volume assumptions for better accuracy
- Consider enterprise-scale scenarios in addition to moderate assumptions

**For Agent_2:**
- Consider adding more granular warehouse sizing options (Lines 25-30)
- Include confidence intervals for cost estimates
- Standardize formatting for cost presentations

**For Both Agents:**
- Include risk factors and alternative scenarios in cost estimates
- Add sensitivity analysis for different data volumes and warehouse sizes
- Consider standardizing the effort estimation methodology across similar migration projects
- Include validation steps and testing protocols in the analysis

The comparison reveals that both agents provide valuable and largely consistent analysis, with Agent_2 offering more detailed enterprise-focused assumptions while Agent_1 provides a more conservative baseline approach. The high structural similarity (95/100) demonstrates consistent methodology, while the semantic similarity (85/100) reflects appropriate adaptation to different scale assumptions.
