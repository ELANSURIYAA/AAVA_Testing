# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to Snowflake migration. Agent1 estimates $0.033 compute cost and 3 hours effort, while Agent2 estimates $0.73 compute cost and 5 hours effort. The significant difference in cost estimates (22x) stems from different data volume assumptions - Agent1 assumes 100MB total data while Agent2 assumes 2.5TB data scanned. Both outputs are well-structured and technically sound but show substantial variance in scale assumptions.

**Overall Similarity Score: 91/100**

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address identical semantic goals: cost estimation for Snowflake migration, effort estimation for code fixes, and API cost calculation. Both recognize the same core activities (DROP/CREATE table, INNER JOIN operations, data validation). Minor semantic differences include Agent1 focusing on moderate-sized datasets while Agent2 assumes enterprise-scale data volumes. Both correctly identify SQL Server to Snowflake conversion challenges.

**Key Alignments:**
- Both identify the same SQL Server constructs requiring conversion (IF EXISTS, TRY...CATCH, SET NOCOUNT ON)
- Both recognize INNER JOIN compatibility between platforms
- Both structure effort estimation into manual fixes and validation phases

**Minor Divergences:**
- Scale assumptions differ significantly (100MB vs 2.5TB)
- Agent2 provides more granular cost breakdown methodology

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) Cost Estimation section with detailed breakdown, (2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with manual fixes and validation subsections, (3) API Cost Calculation. Both use similar formatting with bullet points, subsections, and cost calculations. Agent2 includes slightly more detailed cost breakdown structure but overall flow is highly similar.

**Structural Elements:**
- Identical three-section organization
- Similar subsection breakdown within each major section
- Consistent use of bullet points and cost calculation formatting
- Both include justification sections for estimates

### Correctness

**SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent1 (Score: 95/100)**
Agent1 output is syntactically correct with proper cost calculations, realistic effort estimates, and consistent internal references. Minor issues: cost calculation shows ~$0.033 but could benefit from more detailed warehouse sizing justification. All technical references to Snowflake features and SQL Server constructs are accurate.

**SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent2 (Score: 93/100)**
Agent2 output is syntactically correct with detailed cost breakdowns and comprehensive effort analysis. Minor issues: some redundant explanations in cost calculation section and slight inconsistency in data volume references (2.5TB vs 250GB processed). Technical accuracy is high with proper Snowflake credit calculations.

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent1 | SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 92 |
| Correctness | 95 | 93 | 94 |
| **Overall** | **91** | **90** | **91** |

## Recommendations

**For SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent1:**
- Strengthen cost estimation by providing more detailed warehouse sizing justification and include storage cost considerations in runtime cost summary.

**For SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Agent2:**
- Streamline cost calculation presentation to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency between total data scanned (2.5TB) and processed data (250GB) references.

**For Both Agents:**
- Consider standardizing data volume assumptions for better comparability. Both agents should align on whether to use moderate (100MB-1GB) or enterprise-scale (TB) datasets for cost estimation examples.
