Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two comprehensive SQL Server documentation outputs for employee backup table creation. Both outputs demonstrate identical semantic intent and structural organization with 95+ scores across all dimensions. Minor textual variations exist but do not impact technical accuracy or completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,96,All sections,"Both outputs describe identical SQL Server backup table creation with same business purpose, technical approach, and outcomes. Minor wording differences in sections 1 and 5 (e.g., 'point-in-time comparison' vs 'point-in-time backup', complexity scores 35/100 vs 30/100) but core meaning and intent are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All sections,"Nearly identical 6-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs. Same logical flow, same subsection organization, same technical decomposition approach. Only difference is minor reordering of bullet points in section 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_1,100,All lines,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical descriptions, and accurate SQL Server component references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_2,100,All lines,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical descriptions, and accurate SQL Server component references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency."
