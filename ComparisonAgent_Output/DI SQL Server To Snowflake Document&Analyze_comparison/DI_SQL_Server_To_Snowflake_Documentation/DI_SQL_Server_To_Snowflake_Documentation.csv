Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same SQL Server backup script functionality. They demonstrate nearly identical semantic understanding of the business requirements (employee backup table creation), follow the same structural organization with 6 main sections, and maintain high syntactic correctness as documentation artifacts. The outputs show remarkable consistency in technical analysis, data mapping, and complexity assessment, with only minor variations in phrasing and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All lines,"Both outputs address the identical business problem of creating employee backup tables for troubleshooting and recovery. They share the same understanding of: (1) Core functionality - backup table creation via Employee/Salary joins, (2) Business value - data integrity and recovery support, (3) Technical approach - DDL/DML operations with error handling, (4) Data flow - INNER JOIN on EmployeeNo with identical field mappings. Minor differences exist in descriptive phrasing (e.g., 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' vs 'troubleshooting scenarios') but the fundamental meaning and intent are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,Lines 1-60,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) Header with author/description, (2) Six numbered sections in same order, (3) Subsection breakdowns within each section, (4) Data mapping tables with identical format, (5) Complexity analysis with same metrics, (6) Key outputs summary. The logical flow, section hierarchy, and information decomposition are virtually identical. Only minor formatting differences exist in bullet points vs numbered lists within some subsections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,100,All lines,"The first output maintains perfect syntactic correctness as a documentation artifact. All internal references are consistent, section numbering is sequential (1-6), data mapping table format is valid, technical terminology is accurate, and no broken references or formatting errors exist. The complexity score calculation (35/100) is properly justified with supporting rationale."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,100,All lines,"The second output also maintains perfect syntactic correctness. All sections are properly numbered and formatted, internal cross-references are valid, technical descriptions are accurate, and the data mapping table follows proper structure. The complexity analysis and scoring (35/100) align with the technical assessment provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness as documentation artifacts with no formatting errors, broken references, or internal inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,Lines 1-60,"Maintain the current high-quality documentation standard. Consider adding version control information and timestamp details to enhance traceability. The technical analysis depth and business context alignment are exemplary."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,Lines 1-60,"Continue the excellent documentation practices demonstrated. Consider standardizing bullet point formatting for consistency with organizational style guides. The comprehensive coverage of technical and business aspects is commendable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs represent high-quality technical documentation with excellent semantic alignment and structural consistency. For future iterations, consider: (1) Standardizing formatting conventions, (2) Adding execution timestamps, (3) Including version control metadata, (4) Maintaining the current level of technical depth and business context integration."
