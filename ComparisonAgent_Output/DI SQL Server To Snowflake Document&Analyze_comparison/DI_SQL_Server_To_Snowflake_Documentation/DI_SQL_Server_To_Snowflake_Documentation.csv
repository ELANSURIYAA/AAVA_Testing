Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Two comprehensive SQL Server documentation outputs describing employee backup table creation scripts. Both outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical purpose and approach. Structural similarity is excellent (98/100) with matching 6-section organization. Correctness scores are perfect (100/100) for both agents with no syntax or formatting issues. Overall assessment: 97.7/100 - Near-identical high-quality documentation with only minor stylistic differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All sections,"Both outputs describe identical core functionality: creating dbo.employee_bkup table by joining Employee and Salary tables. Same business objectives (troubleshooting point-in-time comparison recovery). Minor differences in phrasing: Agent_1 uses 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' while Agent_2 uses 'ad-hoc troubleshooting point-in-time comparison'. Both mention enterprise data warehousing alignment. Deduction of 5 points for slight variation in emphasis on compliance aspects (Agent_2 mentions compliance more explicitly in line 8)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All sections,"Nearly identical 6-section structure: Overview Code Structure Data Flow Data Mapping Complexity Analysis Key Outputs. Same subsection organization within each section. Both use bullet points and structured formatting consistently. Agent_2 has slightly more detailed error handling description in section 2. Deduction of 2 points for minor organizational differences in performance considerations placement (Agent_1 line 35 vs Agent_2 line 38)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All lines,"Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references consistent. No broken examples or undefined terms. Proper section numbering and bullet point structure. Data mapping table properly formatted. All technical terms used correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All lines,"Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references consistent. No broken examples or undefined terms. Proper section numbering and bullet point structure. Data mapping table properly formatted. All technical terms used correctly. Slightly more comprehensive error handling description."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting issues internal inconsistencies or technical errors. Average of individual scores: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Maintain current high documentation standards. Consider adding more explicit compliance mentions as seen in Agent_2 output. Current structure and content quality are excellent."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent documentation quality maintained. Current approach with enhanced compliance focus is beneficial. Structure and technical accuracy are exemplary."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs represent high-quality enterprise documentation. Consider standardizing the level of detail in error handling descriptions. Both agents should maintain current structural consistency and technical accuracy. Minor stylistic alignment could achieve perfect semantic scores."
