Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two highly similar SQL Server backup script documentation outputs with identical structure and nearly identical semantic content. Both describe the same employee backup table creation process with minor wording variations. Semantic similarity: 95/100, Structural similarity: 98/100, Correctness: 98/100 average. Overall assessment: 97/100 - Excellent alignment with minimal superficial differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All sections,"Both outputs describe identical SQL Server backup functionality with same business purpose, technical approach, and outcomes. Minor wording differences: Agent1 uses 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' vs Agent2 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting', Agent1 mentions 'optional statistics update' vs Agent2 omits this detail. Core meaning and intent are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All sections,"Identical 6-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs. Same subsection organization, bullet points, and table format in Data Mapping section. Only difference is Agent2 has slightly more detailed error handling description in section 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,98,Lines 1-60,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, accurate technical references. Minor issue: Line 45 mentions 'optional statistics update' without implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,Lines 1-65,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, accurate technical references. Slightly more comprehensive error handling description than Agent1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, consistent internal references, and accurate technical content. Average of individual scores."
