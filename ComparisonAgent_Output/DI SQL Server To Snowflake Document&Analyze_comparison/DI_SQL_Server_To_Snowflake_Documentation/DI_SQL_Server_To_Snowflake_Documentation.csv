Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation analysis of SQL Server scripts for creating employee backup tables. Agent_1 and Agent_2 demonstrate nearly identical understanding of the task, with both producing structured 6-section analyses covering overview, code structure, data flow, mapping, complexity, and outputs. The semantic alignment is exceptional (98/100) with both agents interpreting the same business requirements and technical approach. Structural similarity is outstanding (96/100) as both follow identical section organization and analytical framework. Correctness is perfect (100/100) for both outputs with no syntax errors, consistent internal references, and proper formatting. Overall assessment: 98/100 - These are high-quality, production-ready documentation analyses with minimal superficial differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,All sections,"Both outputs demonstrate exceptional semantic alignment in understanding the core business problem: creating reliable employee backup tables for troubleshooting and recovery. Key semantic matches include: (1) Both identify the same business value - data integrity, auditability, and operational recovery (lines 8-12 in both), (2) Both recognize identical technical components - Employee/Salary tables, INNER JOIN, primary key constraints (lines 15-25), (3) Both describe the same data flow - join Employee and Salary on EmployeeNo, populate backup table (lines 35-45), (4) Both provide identical complexity assessments - 35/100 moderate complexity (lines 55-60). Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 uses 'point-in-time comparison' while Agent_2 uses 'historical comparison' (line 10), but these are synonymous in context. The 2-point deduction reflects these minimal terminology variations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,All sections,"Both outputs follow identical structural organization with 6 main sections in the same sequence: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Section-by-section structural analysis: (1) Overview sections both contain 3 paragraphs with identical logical flow (lines 1-15), (2) Code Structure sections both use bullet-point organization with DDL/DML categorization (lines 16-30), (3) Data Flow sections both describe source→destination→transformation logic (lines 31-45), (4) Data Mapping sections both use identical table format with 5 columns (lines 46-50), (5) Complexity Analysis sections both use identical metrics and scoring (lines 51-65), (6) Key Outputs sections both conclude with storage format and business alignment (lines 66-70). The 4-point deduction reflects minor formatting differences in bullet point styles and paragraph breaks, but the underlying logical structure is virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All lines,"Agent_1 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency. All technical references are accurate: table names (dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary, dbo.employee_bkup) are consistent throughout, SQL terminology is properly used (DDL, DML, INNER JOIN, PRIMARY KEY), section numbering is sequential (1-6), internal cross-references are valid, data mapping table format is properly structured with aligned columns, complexity metrics are internally consistent, and no undefined terms or broken references exist. The documentation follows standard technical writing conventions with proper grammar, punctuation, and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All lines,"Agent_2 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency. All technical references are accurate: table names (dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary, dbo.employee_bkup) are consistent throughout, SQL terminology is properly used (DDL, DML, INNER JOIN, PRIMARY KEY), section numbering is sequential (1-6), internal cross-references are valid, data mapping table format is properly structured with aligned columns, complexity metrics are internally consistent, and no undefined terms or broken references exist. The documentation follows standard technical writing conventions with proper grammar, punctuation, and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs achieve perfect correctness scores with no syntactic errors, consistent internal references, and proper technical documentation standards. The average correctness score is 100/100, indicating both agents produced syntactically sound, well-formed documentation with no structural or referential issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 8-12,"Agent_1 produces excellent documentation with minor enhancement opportunities: (1) Consider standardizing terminology - use either 'point-in-time' or 'historical' consistently when describing backup capabilities, (2) Add more specific line count estimates in complexity analysis for better precision, (3) Consider adding performance benchmarks or expected execution times for different data volumes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 8-12,"Agent_2 produces excellent documentation with minor enhancement opportunities: (1) Consider standardizing terminology - use either 'point-in-time' or 'historical' consistently when describing backup capabilities, (2) Add more specific line count estimates in complexity analysis for better precision, (3) Consider adding performance benchmarks or expected execution times for different data volumes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs represent high-quality technical documentation with exceptional semantic and structural alignment. Key strengths: comprehensive 6-section analysis framework, accurate technical terminology, consistent internal references, and clear business value articulation. For future iterations: (1) Standardize terminology usage across similar concepts, (2) Add quantitative performance metrics where applicable, (3) Consider including example code snippets for complex operations, (4) Add version control or change tracking sections for enterprise documentation standards."
