Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive documentation of SQL Server scripts for creating employee backup tables. They follow identical 6-section structures and cover the same technical aspects with remarkable consistency. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical intent and purpose, excellent structural similarity (98/100) with matching section organization and flow, and perfect correctness (100/100) with no syntax errors or inconsistencies. Minor differences exist in wording choices and specific technical details, but overall represent functionally equivalent documentation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 40-50","Both outputs address the identical goal of documenting an employee backup table creation script. They share the same understanding of business requirements (troubleshooting, point-in-time comparison, recovery), technical approach (joining Employee and Salary tables), and architectural considerations (enterprise data warehousing alignment). Minor semantic differences include: Agent 1 uses 'snapshot of the Employee master data' while Agent 2 uses 'backup copy of Employee master data' (lines 1-5), and slight variations in emphasis on production readiness vs. general enterprise alignment (lines 15-20). The core intent and meaning are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"All sections 1-6","Both outputs follow an identical 6-section structure: Overview, Code Structure and Design, Data Flow and Processing Logic, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. The logical flow, information hierarchy, and decomposition approach are nearly identical. Both use the same data mapping table format, complexity scoring methodology (35/100), and technical component categorization. The only structural difference is minor variation in subsection organization within Code Structure and Design (lines 20-35), where Agent 2 provides slightly more granular component listing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,,"Agent 1 output demonstrates perfect syntax and internal consistency. All technical references are accurate, table names are consistent throughout (dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary, dbo.employee_bkup), data types are properly specified, and no undefined variables or broken references exist. The documentation structure is well-formed with proper section numbering and consistent formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,,"Agent 2 output shows perfect syntax and internal consistency. All technical specifications are accurate, database object references are consistent, and the documentation maintains proper structure throughout. No syntax errors, undefined references, or formatting inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate flawless syntax-level correctness with no technical errors, consistent terminology, and proper documentation structure. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 1-60,"Agent 1 provides excellent comprehensive documentation with strong technical accuracy. Consider adding more specific production deployment considerations and enhanced error handling details to match Agent 2's production-ready emphasis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 1-60,"Agent 2 delivers outstanding production-focused documentation with excellent technical depth. The explicit production-ready positioning and detailed component breakdown represent best practices for enterprise documentation standards."
