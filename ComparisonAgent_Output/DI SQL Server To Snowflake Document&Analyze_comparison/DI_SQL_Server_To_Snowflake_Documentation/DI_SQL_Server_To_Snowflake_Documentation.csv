Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation of SQL Server backup scripts for employee data. The outputs are semantically nearly identical (95/100) with the same business purpose and technical approach. Structurally, they follow identical 6-section formats (98/100). Both are syntactically correct documentation (100/100 each). Key differences are minimal, primarily in wording choices and minor phrasing variations. Overall assessment shows high alignment with 97.7/100 average score."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-60,"Both outputs describe SQL Server backup scripts with identical business purposes: creating employee_bkup tables for troubleshooting and recovery. Core technical concepts are aligned - both mention INNER JOINs between Employee and Salary tables, primary key on EmployeeNo, and TRY-CATCH error handling. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1_Output uses 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' while Agent_2_Output uses 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' (identical). Agent_1_Output mentions 'enterprise data warehousing and analytics' while Agent_2_Output uses same phrase. The 5-point deduction is for very minor wording variations in descriptions that don't affect core meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,Lines 1-60,"Both outputs follow identical 6-section structure: (1) Overview of Program, (2) Code Structure and Design, (3) Data Flow and Processing Logic, (4) Data Mapping, (5) Complexity Analysis, (6) Key Outputs. Section headers are identical. Data mapping tables have identical structure with same column headers. Complexity analysis follows same format with identical metrics. The 2-point deduction is for minor differences in subsection organization within sections - Agent_2_Output has slightly different bullet point ordering in section 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,Lines 1-60,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness as documentation. All internal references are consistent (e.g., table names dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary, dbo.employee_bkup used consistently). Data mapping table is properly formatted with correct column alignment. No broken references or formatting issues. Technical terminology is used correctly throughout. Section numbering is sequential and proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,Lines 1-60,"Agent_2_Output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness as documentation. All internal references are consistent and properly formatted. Data mapping table structure is correct with proper column headers and alignment. No syntax errors in technical descriptions. Section organization is logical and well-formed. All SQL Server terminology is used correctly and consistently."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-60,"Both outputs achieve perfect correctness scores. Average of 100 + 100 = 100. No syntactic errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Agent_1_Output provides excellent documentation quality. Recommendation: Consider standardizing bullet point formatting in section 2 for enhanced readability. The content is comprehensive and technically accurate."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Agent_2_Output provides excellent documentation quality. Recommendation: Minor alignment with Agent_1_Output's subsection organization could improve consistency if these are part of a standardized documentation set. Content quality is high and technically sound."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Both outputs demonstrate high-quality technical documentation with minimal differences. For future iterations: (1) Establish consistent subsection formatting standards, (2) Consider template standardization for bullet point organization, (3) Both outputs are suitable for production use with current quality levels."
