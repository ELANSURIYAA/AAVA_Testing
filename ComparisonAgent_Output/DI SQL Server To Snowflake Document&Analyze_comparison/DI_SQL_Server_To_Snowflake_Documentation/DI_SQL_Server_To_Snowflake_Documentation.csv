Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive documentation for a SQL Server employee backup script. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical understanding of the script's purpose and business value. Structural similarity is excellent (98/100) as both follow the same 6-section format. Correctness scores are high for both agents (Agent_1: 92/100, Agent_2: 95/100) with minor formatting and consistency issues. Overall assessment shows strong alignment between outputs with Agent_2 having slightly better formatting consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in understanding the SQL Server backup script's purpose, business value, and technical implementation. Key similarities include: identical understanding of the backup table creation process, consistent identification of source/target tables (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup), aligned business justification for troubleshooting and recovery scenarios, and matching complexity assessments (35/100 vs 30/100). Minor differences include Agent_1 using 'point-in-time comparison' while Agent_2 uses 'point-in-time backup' (lines 8-12), and slightly different emphasis on enterprise data warehousing benefits. The core technical understanding and documentation intent are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All,"Both outputs follow an identical 6-section structure: 1) Overview of Program, 2) Code Structure and Design, 3) Data Flow and Processing Logic, 4) Data Mapping, 5) Complexity Analysis, 6) Key Outputs. The logical flow, section ordering, and content organization are nearly identical. Both use the same data mapping table format with identical column headers and structure. The complexity analysis follows the same breakdown pattern covering lines of code, table references, joins, and performance considerations. Minor structural differences include Agent_2 having slightly more detailed subsection organization within sections 2 and 5 (lines 25-35, 85-95), but the overall architectural approach is essentially the same."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"15, 45, 78","Agent_1 output shows good syntactic correctness with minor issues: inconsistent spacing in the data mapping table (line 45), minor formatting inconsistency in the complexity analysis bullet points (line 78), and one instance of unclear reference to 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' instead of 'reporting' (line 15). The technical content is accurate, table structures are properly formatted, and all internal references are consistent. SQL syntax references are correct and the overall document structure is well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"22, 67","Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with very minor issues: one formatting inconsistency in bullet point alignment (line 67) and a minor spacing issue in the overview section (line 22). All technical references are accurate, the data mapping table is perfectly formatted, SQL syntax references are correct, and internal document consistency is maintained throughout. The document structure is well-formed and all sections are properly organized."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with only minor formatting and consistency issues that do not impact the technical accuracy or usability of the documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"15, 45, 78","Address minor formatting inconsistencies in data mapping table spacing (line 45) and complexity analysis bullet points (line 78). Clarify the unclear reference 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' on line 15 to improve document clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"22, 67","Minor improvements needed: standardize bullet point alignment in complexity analysis section (line 67) and adjust spacing in overview section (line 22) for enhanced readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide excellent documentation quality. Consider establishing consistent formatting standards for future documentation to eliminate minor spacing and alignment variations. Both agents demonstrate strong understanding of SQL Server backup documentation requirements and produce highly usable technical documentation."
