Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two comprehensive SQL Server documentation outputs analyzed for employee backup table creation scripts. Both outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical business purposes and technical approaches. Structural similarity is excellent (98/100) following the same 6-section documentation framework. Correctness scores are high for both agents (Agent_1: 92/100, Agent_2: 95/100) with minor formatting and detail variations. Overall assessment: 94/100 indicating very strong alignment with minimal differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business problems: creating employee backup tables for troubleshooting and recovery. Core technical approaches are nearly identical using INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables. Business benefits and use cases align perfectly. Minor differences in emphasis on enterprise data warehousing context and specific operational details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,N/A,"Excellent structural alignment with identical 6-section framework: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Both use similar subsection organization and bullet point structures. Minimal variation in presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,Lines 15-20,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: Some inconsistent spacing in data mapping table and minor grammatical variations. Internal references are accurate and cross-references work properly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 10-15,"Excellent formatting and consistency throughout. Better structured data mapping table with cleaner alignment. More consistent use of technical terminology and slightly better grammatical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper documentation structure and accurate technical content."
