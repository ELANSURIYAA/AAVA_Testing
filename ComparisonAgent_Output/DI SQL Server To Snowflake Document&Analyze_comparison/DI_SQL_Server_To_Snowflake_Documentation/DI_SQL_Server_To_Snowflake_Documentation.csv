Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-55 (Agent 1) and Lines 1-55 (Agent 2),"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL Server documentation analysis reports with nearly identical semantic understanding and structural organization. The outputs demonstrate consistent technical accuracy and business context understanding. Minor variations exist in phrasing and emphasis but do not impact overall quality or correctness. Both reports effectively address the same backup script analysis requirements with professional documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-10 (both agents), Lines 15-25 (both agents)","Both outputs demonstrate nearly identical understanding of the SQL Server backup script's purpose, business value, and technical implementation. Core concepts like 'point-in-time backup', 'troubleshooting', 'recovery scenarios', and 'enterprise data warehousing' are consistently addressed. Minor phrasing differences exist (e.g., 'ad-hoc troubleshooting' vs 'troubleshooting') but semantic intent remains aligned. Score reduced by 5 points due to slight variations in emphasis on compliance and auditing aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Section headers (lines 1, 8, 20, 35, 42, 50), Data mapping tables (lines 36-41)","Both outputs follow identical 6-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Logical flow and decomposition approach are nearly identical. Data mapping tables use same format and column structure. Section numbering and organization are consistent. Score reduced by 2 points due to minor differences in subsection emphasis within Code Structure section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,All lines,"Agent 1 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, accurate technical terminology, and well-formed documentation structure. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,All lines,"Agent 2 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, accurate technical terminology, and well-formed documentation structure. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs achieve perfect correctness scores with no syntactic errors, broken references, or structural issues identified."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 42-48,"Agent 1 output is excellent with comprehensive coverage and accurate technical analysis. Minor enhancement opportunity: Consider adding more specific performance optimization recommendations beyond the general suggestions provided."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 42-48,"Agent 2 output is excellent with comprehensive coverage and accurate technical analysis. Minor enhancement opportunity: Consider expanding the external dependencies section to include more detailed discussion of prerequisite database objects and permissions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All sections,"Both outputs represent high-quality documentation analysis with strong technical accuracy and business context. For future iterations, consider: 1) Adding specific code snippets or examples, 2) Including more detailed error handling scenarios, 3) Expanding performance tuning recommendations with specific indexing strategies, 4) Adding version control and deployment considerations."
