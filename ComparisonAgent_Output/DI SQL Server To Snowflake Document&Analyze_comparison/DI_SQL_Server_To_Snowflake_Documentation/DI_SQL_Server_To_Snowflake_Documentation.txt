# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two comprehensive SQL Server documentation outputs for employee backup table creation were analyzed. Both outputs demonstrate identical semantic intent and structural organization with 95+ scores across all dimensions. The outputs describe the same SQL Server script for creating `dbo.employee_bkup` table by joining Employee and Salary tables. Minor textual variations exist but do not impact technical accuracy or completeness.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 96/100)

Both outputs describe identical SQL Server backup table creation with the same business purpose, technical approach, and outcomes. They address the same business problem of creating reliable employee data backups for troubleshooting, point-in-time comparison, and recovery scenarios. 

**Minor differences noted:**
- Line 1: "point-in-time comparison" vs "point-in-time backup" 
- Section 5: Complexity scores differ (35/100 vs 30/100)
- Slight wording variations in technical descriptions

The core meaning, intent, and technical specifications are equivalent across both outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Nearly identical 6-section structure maintained across both outputs:
1. Overview of Program
2. Code Structure and Design  
3. Data Flow and Processing Logic
4. Data Mapping (identical table format)
5. Complexity Analysis
6. Key Outputs

Same logical flow, subsection organization, and technical decomposition approach. The only structural difference is minor reordering of bullet points in section 2, which doesn't affect the overall organization.

### Correctness

**Ascendion_AVA_Output_1: 100/100**
Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical descriptions, and accurate SQL Server component references.

**Ascendion_AVA_Output_2: 100/100** 
Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical descriptions, and accurate SQL Server component references.

**Overall: 100/100**
Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Ascendion_AVA_Output_1 | Ascendion_AVA_Output_2 | Overall |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 96 | 96 | 96 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **98** | **98** | **98** |
