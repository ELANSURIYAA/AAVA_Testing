# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs are comprehensive SQL analysis reports for the same employee backup table creation script. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical intent and coverage of complexity metrics, syntax analysis, manual adjustments, optimization techniques, and API cost calculations. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) with consistent section organization and flow. Correctness is high for both outputs (Agent1: 88/100, Agent2: 90/100, Overall: 89/100) with minor variations in specific details and formatting.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs analyze the same SQL script with identical core intent: comprehensive analysis of employee backup table creation. Key semantic alignments include:

1. **Complexity Assessment**: Both focus on joins, DML statements, and error handling patterns
2. **SQL Server Syntax Identification**: Consistent identification of TRY...CATCH, IF EXISTS, and INNER JOIN patterns
3. **Performance Optimization**: Similar recommendations for indexing and partitioning strategies
4. **API Cost Calculations**: Both provide cost estimates (Agent1: 0.0010 USD, Agent2: 0.0032 USD)

**Minor Semantic Differences**:
- Agent1 reports complexity score 35/100 vs Agent2's 30/100 (lines 8-9)
- Slight variations in optimization emphasis and detail level

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Excellent structural alignment with identical 5-section organization:
1. Complexity Metrics
2. Syntax Analysis  
3. Manual Adjustments
4. Optimization Techniques
5. API Cost Calculation

**Structural Differences**:
- Agent1 uses bullet points more consistently throughout
- Agent2 provides more detailed conditional logic breakdown (lines 15-17)
- Agent2 includes more granular DML statement enumeration

### Correctness

**Agent1 (Score: 88/100)**:
- High technical accuracy in SQL analysis
- Minor issues: Complexity score methodology not fully explained, line count approximation lacks precision
- Syntax analysis is comprehensive and accurate

**Agent2 (Score: 90/100)**:
- Very high correctness with excellent technical detail
- More precise conditional logic enumeration including XACT_STATE() function
- Better structured breakdown of DML statements
- Minor improvement area: API cost calculation methodology not detailed

**Overall Correctness: 89/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Correctness | 88 | 90 | 89 |
| **Overall** | **92** | **92** | **92** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent1**: Enhance complexity scoring methodology transparency and provide more script-specific optimization recommendations rather than generic database optimization advice.

**For Agent2**: Maintain the excellent level of technical detail while adding methodology explanations for API cost calculations and complexity scoring.

**For Both**: Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology and enhancing cost calculation transparency for improved consistency across analyses. Both outputs provide valuable SQL analysis with strong technical foundation.
