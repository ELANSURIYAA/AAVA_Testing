# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive SQL complexity analysis reports for an employee backup table creation script. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical structural organization (98/100) and excellent technical correctness (95/100 average). Both agents correctly identified the script's moderate complexity (35/100), SQL Server-specific syntax patterns, and provided relevant optimization recommendations. Key differences lie in implementation details, error handling approaches, and specific optimization suggestions.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs analyze the same SQL backup script with highly similar intent and conclusions. Agent_1 focuses on ~55 lines while Agent_2 specifies 60 lines including comments. Both identify identical complexity scores (35/100), same number of tables (3), joins (1), and DML statements with minor counting variations. Core semantic understanding of the script's purpose, complexity factors, and optimization needs is virtually identical. Minor differences in specific recommendations (Agent_2 mentions indexed views, Agent_1 focuses on partitioning strategies) but overall semantic alignment is strong.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: 1) Complexity Metrics, 2) Syntax Analysis, 3) Manual Adjustments, 4) Optimization Techniques, 5) API Cost Calculation. Section ordering, logical flow, and decomposition approach are nearly identical. Both use bullet-point formatting for metrics, similar categorization of SQL features, and parallel organization of optimization recommendations. Minor structural differences include Agent_2's additional checklist mentions and slightly more detailed conditional logic breakdown (3 vs 2 items), but core structural similarity is exceptional.

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 95/100):** Agent_1 output demonstrates excellent technical correctness with accurate SQL complexity metrics, valid syntax pattern identification, and sound optimization recommendations. All technical details are internally consistent including table counts (3), join counts (1), and complexity scoring methodology. Minor areas for improvement include more specific line count precision and additional detail on error handling complexity assessment.

**Agent_2 (Score: 95/100):** Agent_2 output shows excellent technical correctness with comprehensive SQL analysis, accurate syntax pattern identification, and detailed optimization strategies. Technical metrics are consistent and well-justified, including proper identification of conditional logic patterns and error handling mechanisms. All recommendations are technically sound and appropriately detailed for the analyzed script complexity.

**Overall Correctness: 95/100** - Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with accurate SQL analysis, consistent internal logic, and valid optimization recommendations. No significant technical errors or inconsistencies detected in either output.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| **Overall** | **95** | **95** | **95** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:** Consider adding more specific line count precision and expanding error handling complexity assessment details. Strengthen recommendations with more concrete implementation examples for partitioning strategies.

**For Agent_2:** Maintain the comprehensive approach to conditional logic analysis and detailed optimization strategies. Consider standardizing metric counting methodology to ensure consistency with other analysis tools.

**Overall:** Both outputs provide valuable SQL complexity analysis with strong technical accuracy. Consider establishing standardized line counting methodology and expanding specific implementation examples for optimization recommendations. Both agents successfully identified key optimization opportunities and provided actionable technical guidance.
