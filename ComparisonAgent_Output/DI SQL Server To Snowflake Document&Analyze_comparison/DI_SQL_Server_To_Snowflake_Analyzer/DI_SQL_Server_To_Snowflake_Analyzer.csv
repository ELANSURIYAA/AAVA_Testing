Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs provide comprehensive T-SQL complexity analysis reports for employee backup table creation scripts. They share identical complexity scores (35/100) and similar structural approaches, with Agent_2 providing more detailed documentation and higher API costs. Key differences include line count (55 vs 60), documentation depth, and cost efficiency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs analyze identical T-SQL backup table creation functionality with same complexity scoring methodology. Agent_1 focuses on concise technical analysis while Agent_2 emphasizes production-readiness and detailed documentation. Both identify same optimization opportunities and syntax patterns. Minor divergence in emphasis on error handling details and documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,,"Nearly identical analytical structure with same 5-section format: Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Calculation. Both use consistent bullet-point organization and similar subsection breakdowns. Agent_2 includes additional checklist elements and more detailed commentary within same framework."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8-12,"Minor inconsistency in DML statement count (reports 1 INSERT but lists multiple DML operations). All technical analysis is syntactically correct with accurate complexity scoring and valid optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 15-18,"Slight discrepancy in DML count description but more comprehensive error handling documentation. All syntax analysis and recommendations are technically accurate with proper T-SQL terminology usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minor counting inconsistencies. All SQL Server syntax patterns correctly identified and optimization recommendations are valid and actionable."
