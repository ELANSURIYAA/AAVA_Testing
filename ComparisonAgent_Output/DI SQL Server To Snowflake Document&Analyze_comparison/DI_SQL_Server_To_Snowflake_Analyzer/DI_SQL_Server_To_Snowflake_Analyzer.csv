Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-55","Both outputs provide comprehensive SQL analysis reports for the same Employee backup table creation script. The analyses are semantically very similar with identical conclusions about complexity scoring (35/100 vs 30/100), syntax patterns, and optimization recommendations. Structural organization is nearly identical across both reports. Minor differences exist in complexity scoring methodology and specific wording of recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-55","Both outputs analyze the same SQL backup script with highly similar semantic understanding. Both identify: same table count (3), same join count (1), same DML operations, identical syntax patterns (TRY...CATCH, IF EXISTS), and similar optimization recommendations. Key difference: Output 1 scores complexity at 35/100 while Output 2 scores at 30/100, but both classify as low-moderate complexity with identical reasoning about absence of expensive operations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-55","Nearly identical structural organization with same 5 main sections: Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Calculation. Both use consistent bullet-point formatting and similar subsection organization. Minor structural differences in bullet point ordering and some subsection emphasis, but overall flow and decomposition approach are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analysis_Output_1,98,"Lines 1-55","Well-formed analysis report with consistent formatting, accurate technical terminology, and proper section organization. Minor issue: complexity score of 35/100 vs stated ~55 lines creates slight inconsistency in metrics presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analysis_Output_2,99,"Lines 1-55","Excellent report structure with comprehensive technical analysis, consistent formatting, and accurate SQL Server syntax identification. All sections are complete and technically sound with proper terminology usage throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper technical analysis structure and accurate SQL syntax identification. Average of individual scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analysis_Output_1,,"Lines 20-25, 35-40","Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology to ensure consistency between analysis runs. The 35/100 complexity score should be validated against the stated criteria."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analysis_Output_2,,"Lines 15-20, 30-35","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding more specific line references when discussing optimization opportunities to enhance actionability of recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-55","Both analyses provide valuable SQL optimization insights. Consider consolidating the slight differences in complexity scoring methodology to create a more standardized analysis framework. Both outputs would benefit from more specific performance benchmarking data to support optimization recommendations."
