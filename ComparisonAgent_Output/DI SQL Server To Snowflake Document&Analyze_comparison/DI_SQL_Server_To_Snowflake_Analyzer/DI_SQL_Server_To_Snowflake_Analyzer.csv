Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive SQL complexity analysis reports for an employee backup table creation script. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical structural organization (98/100) and excellent technical correctness (95/100 average). Both agents correctly identified the script's moderate complexity (35/100), SQL Server-specific syntax patterns, and provided relevant optimization recommendations. Key differences lie in implementation details, error handling approaches, and specific optimization suggestions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All lines,"Both outputs analyze the same SQL backup script with highly similar intent and conclusions. Agent_1 focuses on ~55 lines while Agent_2 specifies 60 lines including comments. Both identify identical complexity scores (35/100), same number of tables (3), joins (1), and DML statements with minor counting variations. Core semantic understanding of the script's purpose, complexity factors, and optimization needs is virtually identical. Minor differences in specific recommendations (Agent_2 mentions indexed views, Agent_1 focuses on partitioning strategies) but overall semantic alignment is strong."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All sections,"Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: 1) Complexity Metrics, 2) Syntax Analysis, 3) Manual Adjustments, 4) Optimization Techniques, 5) API Cost Calculation. Section ordering, logical flow, and decomposition approach are nearly identical. Both use bullet-point formatting for metrics, similar categorization of SQL features, and parallel organization of optimization recommendations. Minor structural differences include Agent_2's additional checklist mentions and slightly more detailed conditional logic breakdown (3 vs 2 items), but core structural similarity is exceptional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-55,"Agent_1 output demonstrates excellent technical correctness with accurate SQL complexity metrics, valid syntax pattern identification, and sound optimization recommendations. All technical details are internally consistent including table counts (3), join counts (1), and complexity scoring methodology. Minor areas for improvement include more specific line count precision and additional detail on error handling complexity assessment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 1-60,"Agent_2 output shows excellent technical correctness with comprehensive SQL analysis, accurate syntax pattern identification, and detailed optimization strategies. Technical metrics are consistent and well-justified, including proper identification of conditional logic patterns and error handling mechanisms. All recommendations are technically sound and appropriately detailed for the analyzed script complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with accurate SQL analysis, consistent internal logic, and valid optimization recommendations. No significant technical errors or inconsistencies detected in either output."
