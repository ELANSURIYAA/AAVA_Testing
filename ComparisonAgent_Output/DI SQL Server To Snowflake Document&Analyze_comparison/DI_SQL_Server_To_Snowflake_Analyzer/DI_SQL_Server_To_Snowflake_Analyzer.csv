Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-55,"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL Server analysis reports with identical structural organization and highly similar content. Agent_1 scored complexity at 35/100 while Agent_2 scored 30/100, reflecting minor analytical differences. Both outputs demonstrate thorough understanding of SQL optimization, error handling, and performance considerations. The reports are semantically equivalent with 95% similarity, structurally nearly identical at 98% similarity, and both syntactically correct at 100%."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-55,"Both outputs address identical SQL Server backup table analysis with same intent and methodology. Minor differences: Agent_1 complexity score 35/100 vs Agent_2 30/100 (lines 18-19), Agent_1 API cost 0.0010 vs Agent_2 0.0032 (lines 54-55). Core analysis elements, optimization recommendations, and technical insights are semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,Lines 1-55,"Nearly identical 5-section structure: Header, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Same subsection organization and logical flow. Only structural difference is minor formatting variations in complexity score presentation (lines 18-19)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-55,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper section headers, consistent formatting, valid technical terminology, and coherent internal references. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-55,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with proper section headers, consistent formatting, valid technical terminology, and coherent internal references. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-55,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency. Average correctness score: 100/100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 18-19,"Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology to align with Agent_2's more conservative 30/100 assessment for consistency across similar analyses."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 54-55,"Review API cost calculation methodology as 0.0032 USD appears higher than Agent_1's 0.0010 USD for similar analysis scope."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-55,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent technical analysis quality. Consider establishing unified scoring rubrics for complexity metrics and API cost calculations to ensure consistency across analyses. The high semantic and structural similarity indicates strong analytical framework alignment."
