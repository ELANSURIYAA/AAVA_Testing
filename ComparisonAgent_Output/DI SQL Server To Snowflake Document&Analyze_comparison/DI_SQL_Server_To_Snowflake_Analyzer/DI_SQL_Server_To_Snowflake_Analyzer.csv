Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SQL complexity analysis reports for the same employee backup table creation script. The outputs demonstrate high semantic similarity (92/100) with nearly identical analytical intent and conclusions. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with both following the same 5-section format and analytical flow. Correctness scores are high for both agents (SQL_Analyzer_Run1: 88/100, SQL_Analyzer_Run2: 90/100, Overall: 89/100) with minor discrepancies in metrics and cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All Lines,"Both outputs analyze the same SQL script with identical understanding of purpose and scope. Key semantic alignments: Both identify the script as creating employee backup tables with salary data, both recognize moderate complexity due to error handling, both provide similar optimization recommendations. Minor differences: Run1 scores complexity at 35/100 while Run2 scores 30/100, and API cost calculations differ (0.0010 vs 0.0032 USD). The core analytical intent and conclusions are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,All Lines,"Excellent structural alignment with both outputs following identical 5-section format: 1) Complexity Metrics, 2) Syntax Analysis, 3) Manual Adjustments, 4) Optimization Techniques, 5) API Cost Calculation. Both use consistent subsection organization within each major section. Flow and logical decomposition are nearly identical. Minor structural differences include slight variations in bullet point formatting and subsection emphasis, but overall architecture is remarkably consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analyzer_Run1,88,Lines 8-9 and 54,"High correctness with minor issues: Complexity score of 35/100 appears slightly high given the analysis content which emphasizes moderate complexity. Line count stated as ~55 with tilde notation lacks precision. API cost of 0.0010 USD needs verification for accuracy. All other technical analysis appears syntactically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analyzer_Run2,90,Line 54,"Very high correctness with minimal issues: More precise line count (55 including comments), more detailed complexity breakdown, better justified complexity score of 30/100. Only concern is API cost of 0.0032 USD which differs significantly from Run1 and needs verification. Technical analysis is comprehensive and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor discrepancies in metrics and calculations that should be verified for consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analyzer_Run1,,Lines 8-9 and 54,"Standardize complexity scoring methodology to ensure consistent 30-35 point range interpretation. Verify API cost calculation accuracy (0.0010 USD seems low). Use precise line counts rather than approximations (~55)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analyzer_Run2,,Line 54,"Verify API cost calculation methodology as 0.0032 USD differs significantly from other runs. Consider adding more granular complexity sub-scores to justify the 30/100 overall rating."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All Lines,"Establish standardized API cost calculation methodology across all analyzer runs. Both outputs would benefit from cross-validation of metrics. Consider implementing automated consistency checks for complexity scoring. The high-quality analytical framework should be maintained while ensuring metric precision and reproducibility."
