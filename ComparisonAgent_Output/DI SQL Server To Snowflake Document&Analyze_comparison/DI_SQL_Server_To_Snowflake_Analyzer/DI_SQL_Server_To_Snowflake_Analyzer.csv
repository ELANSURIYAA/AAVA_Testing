Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs are comprehensive SQL analysis reports for the same employee backup table creation script. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical intent and coverage of complexity metrics, syntax analysis, manual adjustments, optimization techniques, and API cost calculations. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) with consistent section organization and flow. Correctness is high for both outputs (Agent1: 88/100, Agent2: 90/100, Overall: 89/100) with minor variations in specific details and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All sections,"Both outputs analyze the same SQL script with identical core intent: comprehensive analysis of employee backup table creation. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Complexity assessment focusing on joins, DML statements, and error handling, (2) SQL Server-specific syntax identification, (3) Performance optimization recommendations, (4) Similar API cost calculations. Minor semantic differences: Agent1 reports complexity score 35/100 vs Agent2's 30/100, and slight variations in optimization emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Excellent structural alignment with identical 5-section organization: (1) Complexity Metrics, (2) Syntax Analysis, (3) Manual Adjustments, (4) Optimization Techniques, (5) API Cost Calculation. Both follow consistent subsection patterns within each main section. Minor structural differences include: Agent1 uses bullet points more consistently, Agent2 includes more detailed conditional logic breakdown (lines 15-17), and Agent2 provides more granular DML statement enumeration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,88,Lines 8-12,"High correctness with minor issues: (1) Complexity score calculation methodology not fully explained, (2) Line count approximation (~55) lacks precision, (3) Some optimization recommendations are generic rather than script-specific. Syntax analysis is accurate and comprehensive. Error handling assessment is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,90,Lines 8-20,"Very high correctness with comprehensive detail: (1) More precise conditional logic enumeration, (2) Better structured DML statement breakdown, (3) More specific syntax pattern identification including XACT_STATE() function. Minor areas for improvement: API cost calculation methodology not detailed, some recommendations remain generic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy in SQL analysis with comprehensive coverage of complexity, syntax, and optimization aspects. Agent2 shows slightly better precision in technical details and conditional logic analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,Lines 25-35,"Enhance complexity scoring methodology transparency and provide more script-specific optimization recommendations rather than generic database optimization advice."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,Lines 25-40,"Maintain the excellent level of technical detail while adding methodology explanations for API cost calculations and complexity scoring."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs provide valuable SQL analysis with strong technical foundation. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology and enhancing cost calculation transparency for improved consistency across analyses."
