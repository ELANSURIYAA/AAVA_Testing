Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_1 and SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_2 provide comprehensive T-SQL script analysis for employee backup table creation. Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment (85/100) with identical core objectives and similar analytical frameworks. Structural similarity is high (88/100) with both following the same 5-section format. Correctness scores are excellent: SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_1 (95/100) and SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_2 (92/100), with minor inconsistencies in Agent 2's line count and cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing T-SQL scripts for employee backup table creation. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Same complexity scoring methodology (35/100), (2) Identical table identification (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup), (3) Similar join analysis (1 INNER JOIN), (4) Consistent DML statement categorization, (5) Aligned optimization recommendations. Minor semantic divergences: Agent 2 provides more granular conditional logic breakdown (3 vs 2 elements) and includes additional syntax patterns like SET NOCOUNT ON. Both maintain consistent analytical depth and technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: (1) Complexity Metrics, (2) Syntax Analysis, (3) Manual Adjustments, (4) Optimization Techniques, (5) API Cost Calculation. Structural alignment includes: consistent subsection organization, similar bullet-point formatting, parallel complexity scoring presentation, and aligned optimization categorization. Minor structural differences: Agent 2 includes additional conditional logic details (lines 15-20), more comprehensive syntax pattern enumeration (lines 25-35), and expanded optimization recommendations (lines 45-55). Both maintain logical flow and professional formatting standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_1,95,Lines 8-12,"High syntactic correctness with minor issues: (1) Line count stated as ~55 but analysis suggests closer to 50 lines, (2) All technical metrics are internally consistent, (3) SQL Server syntax patterns correctly identified, (4) Optimization recommendations are technically sound, (5) API cost calculation appears accurate at 0.0010 USD. No syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Server_Analysis_Agent_2,92,Lines 8-12 and 58,"Good syntactic correctness with some inconsistencies: (1) Line count stated as 60 including comments but analysis suggests 55-58 actual lines, (2) DML statement count listed as 4 but detailed breakdown suggests 5 operations, (3) API cost significantly higher at 0.0076 USD without clear justification for 7.6x increase, (4) All SQL Server syntax patterns correctly identified, (5) Optimization techniques are technically accurate. Minor internal consistency issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor internal consistency issues primarily in quantitative metrics and cost calculations."
