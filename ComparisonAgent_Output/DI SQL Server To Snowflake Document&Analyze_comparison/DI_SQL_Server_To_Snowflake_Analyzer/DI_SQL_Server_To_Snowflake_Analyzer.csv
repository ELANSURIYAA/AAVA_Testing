Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-60,"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL Server analysis reports with identical structure and purpose. Agent_1 provided a concise 55-line analysis while Agent_2 delivered a more detailed 60-line version with enhanced error handling documentation. Both reports cover complexity metrics, syntax analysis, manual adjustments, optimization techniques, and API cost calculations for the same Employee backup table creation script."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-60,"Both outputs address identical goals: analyzing a SQL Server script for creating Employee backup tables. They share the same analytical framework covering complexity metrics, syntax analysis, optimization recommendations, and cost calculations. Minor semantic differences exist in depth of error handling discussion (lines 45-50 in Agent_2) and specific optimization recommendations (lines 35-40 in both), but core intent and meaning are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,1-60,"Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: (1) Complexity Metrics, (2) Syntax Analysis, (3) Manual Adjustments, (4) Optimization Techniques, (5) API Cost Calculation. Agent_2 includes additional subsections for error handling details (lines 45-50) and more granular optimization breakdowns (lines 38-42). The logical flow and decomposition approach are nearly identical with Agent_2 providing enhanced granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,1-55,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper section headers, consistent formatting, and accurate technical terminology. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity score presentation (line 15) where bullet points could be more uniform. All technical references and SQL syntax descriptions are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,1-60,"Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and comprehensive technical accuracy. Enhanced documentation structure with detailed checklists and error handling explanations (lines 45-50). All SQL syntax references and optimization recommendations are technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Both outputs maintain high syntactic correctness with Agent_2 showing slightly superior formatting consistency and documentation completeness. Average correctness score reflects minimal formatting variations in Agent_1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,35-40,"Consider expanding error handling documentation and adding more detailed optimization checklists to match the comprehensiveness of Agent_2. Standardize bullet point formatting in complexity metrics section for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,1-60,"Maintain current level of detail and documentation quality. Consider condensing some sections to improve conciseness while preserving technical accuracy. The enhanced error handling documentation and optimization details represent best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-60,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical analysis capabilities. Future iterations should standardize on Agent_2's enhanced documentation approach while maintaining Agent_1's conciseness where appropriate. Consider developing a hybrid approach that balances comprehensive coverage with efficient presentation."
