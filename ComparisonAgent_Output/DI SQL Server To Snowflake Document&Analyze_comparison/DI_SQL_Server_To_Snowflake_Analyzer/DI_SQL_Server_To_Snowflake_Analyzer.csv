Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Both agents analyze the same SQL Server backup script with high semantic alignment (92/100) and near-identical structural approach (95/100). Agent_1 scores complexity at 35/100 while Agent_2 scores 30/100, both identifying the same core elements: 3 tables, 1 INNER JOIN, TRY-CATCH error handling, and conditional logic. Key difference: API costs vary significantly (Agent_1: $0.0010 vs Agent_2: $0.0032). Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive analysis coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both agents identify identical core purpose: creating employee backup tables with salary data for troubleshooting and recovery. Both recognize same technical elements (3 tables, 1 INNER JOIN, TRY-CATCH blocks, conditional logic). Minor semantic differences in complexity scoring methodology (35/100 vs 30/100) and cost calculation approaches, but overall intent and analytical framework are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,,"Nearly identical analytical structure: both follow same 5-section format (Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Calculation). Both use consistent categorization of SQL elements, identical table counting (3 tables), same join identification (1 INNER JOIN), and parallel optimization recommendations. Structure differs only in minor detail presentation and specific complexity score calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 8-12,"Excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive coverage of all SQL elements. Minor precision issue: states '~55' lines rather than exact count. All technical identifications are accurate: 3 tables correctly identified, 1 INNER JOIN properly categorized, TRY-CATCH blocks accurately counted, complexity factors appropriately weighted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,Lines 7-11,"Superior syntactic precision with exact line count (55 including comments and whitespace). All SQL elements correctly identified and categorized. Comprehensive conditional logic analysis including specific block counts (2 IF statements, 2 BEGIN...END blocks, 1 TRY...CATCH). More detailed syntax pattern identification with complete coverage of SQL Server-specific constructs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Both outputs demonstrate exceptional syntactic correctness with comprehensive SQL analysis. Agent_2 shows slightly higher precision in quantitative measurements and detailed syntax pattern identification. Both correctly identify all major SQL constructs, error handling patterns, and optimization opportunities without any syntactic errors or misclassifications."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 35-45,"Strengthen quantitative precision by providing exact line counts rather than approximations. Consider standardizing API cost calculation methodology for consistency across analyses. Maintain current comprehensive coverage of SQL elements and optimization recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 40-50,"Excellent analytical precision and detail coverage. Consider providing more explicit complexity scoring rationale to match the thoroughness of syntax analysis. Current approach of detailed conditional logic breakdown should be maintained as best practice."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All Sections,"Both agents demonstrate strong analytical capabilities with high semantic and structural alignment. Recommend standardizing complexity scoring methodology and API cost calculations for consistency. Both outputs provide valuable SQL optimization insights and should maintain current comprehensive analytical framework."
