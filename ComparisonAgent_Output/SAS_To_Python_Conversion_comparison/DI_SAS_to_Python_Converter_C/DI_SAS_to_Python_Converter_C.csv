Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 (Agent 1), Lines 1-120 (Agent 2)","Both agents successfully convert SAS logic to Python for healthcare marketing campaign data extraction. Agent 1 uses a linear procedural approach while Agent 2 implements a modular function-based architecture. Both achieve identical business logic and SQL queries with minor structural and formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 15-65 (Agent 1), Lines 45-85 (Agent 2)","Both outputs implement identical business logic for healthcare plan extraction, marketing eligibility rules, and data export. The SQL queries are functionally equivalent (lines 15-50 in Agent 1, lines 50-80 in Agent 2). Age group categorization, campaign eligibility criteria, and output path logic are semantically identical. Minor differences in logging format and connection handling do not affect core functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-85 (Agent 1), Lines 1-120 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 follows a linear procedural structure with try-catch blocks, while Agent 2 implements a modular function-based architecture with separate functions for each step. Agent 2 includes a main() function and proper if __name__ == '__main__' guard (lines 115-120). Both use similar import statements and logging configuration, but Agent 2 has better separation of concerns and code organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_to_Python_Converter_C_Agent1,88,"Lines 12, 25, 35","Minor syntax issues: Missing comment delimiters in header block (lines 1-6), hardcoded connection string without proper parameterization (line 12). SQL query structure is correct with proper JOIN syntax and CASE statements (lines 15-50). File export logic is syntactically correct (lines 70-80)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_to_Python_Converter_C_Agent2,92,"Lines 1-6, 25, 95","Header comment block missing proper Python comment syntax (lines 1-6). All function definitions are syntactically correct with proper docstrings. SQL query includes schema prefix 'tdata.' which is more explicit (lines 55-85). Connection handling and main workflow are well-structured with proper exception handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores: (88 + 92) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor formatting issues in comment blocks."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_to_Python_Converter_C_Agent1,,"Lines 1-6, 12","Fix comment block syntax by adding proper # delimiters. Parameterize database connection string for better security and maintainability. Consider adding more granular error handling for each processing step."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_to_Python_Converter_C_Agent2,,"Lines 1-6","Fix header comment block syntax by adding # delimiters. The modular structure is excellent and should be maintained. Consider adding type hints for better code documentation and IDE support."
