Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-89 vs 1-106","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest scripts for healthcare marketing data extraction validation. Ascendion AVAA focuses on 6 core test cases with detailed implementation, while Ascendion AVA+ extends to 8 test cases including additional edge case handling. Both demonstrate solid understanding of testing requirements but differ in scope and implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-89 vs 1-106","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing healthcare marketing data extraction functionality. Key similarities include: database connection testing, data extraction validation, eligibility logic verification, and file export testing. However, Ascendion AVA+ includes additional edge cases (NULL handling, empty datasets, invalid formats, missing columns) that Ascendion AVAA does not cover. The core business logic understanding is aligned but coverage scope differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-89 vs 1-106","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case documentation table followed by pytest implementation. Ascendion AVAA uses a more detailed tabular format with Input Data Description and Expected Outcome columns, while Ascendion AVA+ uses a simpler list format. Both pytest implementations use fixtures and follow standard testing patterns, but Ascendion AVA+ includes more comprehensive fixture setup and error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVAA,85,"Lines 23-89","Pytest script has solid syntax but contains some issues: Line 45 lambda function may fail on None values without proper null handling. Line 67 eligibility logic assumes all fields are present without validation. Missing import statements for some functions. Overall structure is sound but lacks defensive programming practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+,92,"Lines 32-106","Pytest script demonstrates better defensive programming: proper exception handling in lines 89-106, comprehensive fixture setup in lines 37-50, and explicit error testing for edge cases. Minor issue: line 85 assumes create_marketing_extract function exists without import validation. Overall more robust implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Ascendion AVA+ shows superior error handling and edge case coverage, while Ascendion AVAA provides more detailed business logic implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVAA,,"Lines 45, 67","Add null value handling in lambda functions and validation checks before applying business logic. Include comprehensive error handling for database connection failures and missing data scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+,,"Line 85","Ensure all imported functions are properly defined and available. Consider adding more specific assertion messages for better test failure diagnosis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Consider combining the detailed business logic approach of Ascendion AVAA with the comprehensive edge case handling of Ascendion AVA+ for optimal test coverage. Both outputs would benefit from integration testing scenarios and performance testing considerations."
