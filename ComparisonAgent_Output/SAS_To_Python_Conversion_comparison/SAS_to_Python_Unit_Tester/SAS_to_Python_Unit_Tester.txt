# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent1_Output provides a more comprehensive and structured approach with detailed metadata header, formatted test case table, complete pytest implementation with fixtures and mocking, and professional documentation. Agent2_Output offers a simpler but functional approach with basic test cases and pytest scripts. Both address the core requirement of creating test cases for healthcare data processing, but Agent1_Output demonstrates superior enterprise-grade quality and completeness.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of creating test cases for healthcare marketing data extraction and processing. They both identify key testing areas: data extraction, age classification, eligibility logic, filtering, and file export. However, Agent1_Output includes additional semantic depth with marketing segment creation and more comprehensive business logic testing (lines 10-50), while Agent2_Output focuses on basic functional testing with error handling scenarios (lines 5-40).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Agent1_Output follows a more structured approach with clear metadata header, formatted test case table, and organized pytest implementation with proper fixtures (lines 15-80). Agent2_Output uses a simpler markdown structure with basic test case descriptions followed by pytest code (lines 10-70). Both use similar pytest patterns but Agent1_Output demonstrates better code organization and professional structure.

### Correctness

**Agent1_Output (Score: 95/100):** Demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper Python imports, well-structured pytest fixtures, appropriate mocking patterns, and valid pandas operations (lines 25-90). Minor issue: Line 45 uses lambda functions that could be more readable, but syntax is correct.

**Agent2_Output (Score: 88/100):** Shows good syntax correctness with proper pytest structure and valid Python code. Issues identified: Line 35 references undefined functions (connect_to_teradata, create_marketing_extract) without imports, Line 55 has incomplete exception handling patterns, and Line 65 shows inconsistent mock data usage.

**Overall Correctness: 92/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1_Output | Agent2_Output | Overall |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 95 | 88 | 92 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **83** | **84** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent1_Output:** Maintain the excellent structure and comprehensive approach. Consider simplifying complex lambda functions for better readability (lines 1-100). The metadata header and professional formatting set a high standard for enterprise deliverables.

**For Agent2_Output:** Improve code completeness by adding proper imports for referenced functions. Enhance exception handling with specific error types. Consider adopting the structured table format from Agent1_Output for better presentation. Add metadata header for professional documentation standards (lines 15-75).

**For Both:** Both outputs successfully address the core requirements. Agent1_Output represents the gold standard for enterprise-grade test case development, while Agent2_Output provides a solid foundation that could be enhanced. Future implementations should combine Agent1_Output's structure with Agent2_Output's error handling focus.
