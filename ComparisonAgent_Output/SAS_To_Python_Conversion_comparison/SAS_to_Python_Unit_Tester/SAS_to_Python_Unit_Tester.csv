Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-100+ vs Lines 1-80+","Agent1_Output provides a more comprehensive and structured approach with detailed metadata header, formatted test case table, complete pytest implementation with fixtures and mocking, and professional documentation. Agent2_Output offers a simpler but functional approach with basic test cases and pytest scripts. Both address the core requirement of creating test cases for healthcare data processing, but Agent1_Output demonstrates superior enterprise-grade quality and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 10-50 vs Lines 5-40","Both outputs address the same core objective of creating test cases for healthcare marketing data extraction and processing. They both identify key testing areas: data extraction, age classification, eligibility logic, filtering, and file export. However, Agent1_Output includes additional semantic depth with marketing segment creation and more comprehensive business logic testing, while Agent2_Output focuses on basic functional testing with error handling scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-80 vs Lines 10-70","Agent1_Output follows a more structured approach with clear metadata header, formatted table presentation, and organized pytest implementation with proper fixtures. Agent2_Output uses a simpler markdown structure with basic test case descriptions followed by pytest code. Both use similar pytest patterns but Agent1_Output demonstrates better code organization and professional structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Output,95,"Lines 25-90","Agent1_Output demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper Python imports, well-structured pytest fixtures, appropriate mocking patterns, and valid pandas operations. Minor issue: Line 45 uses lambda functions that could be more readable, but syntax is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Output,88,"Lines 15-75","Agent2_Output shows good syntax correctness with proper pytest structure and valid Python code. Issues identified: Line 35 references undefined functions (connect_to_teradata, create_marketing_extract) without imports, Line 55 has incomplete exception handling patterns, and Line 65 shows inconsistent mock data usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 88) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Output,,"Lines 1-100","Maintain the excellent structure and comprehensive approach. Consider simplifying complex lambda functions for better readability. The metadata header and professional formatting set a high standard for enterprise deliverables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Output,,"Lines 15-75","Improve code completeness by adding proper imports for referenced functions. Enhance exception handling with specific error types. Consider adopting the structured table format from Agent1_Output for better presentation. Add metadata header for professional documentation standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs successfully address the core requirements. Agent1_Output represents the gold standard for enterprise-grade test case development, while Agent2_Output provides a solid foundation that could be enhanced. Future implementations should combine Agent1_Output's structure with Agent2_Output's error handling focus."
