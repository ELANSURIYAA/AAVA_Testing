Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3","Comparison between SAS_to_Python_Reviewer (comprehensive structured review) and Data_Engineer_Response (brief status update). Outputs serve completely different purposes with minimal semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3","SAS_to_Python_Reviewer provides comprehensive analysis of SAS to Python conversion including accuracy assessment, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. Data_Engineer_Response only indicates waiting for Python implementation file. Fundamentally different task understanding and execution."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3","SAS_to_Python_Reviewer uses structured report format with metadata header, numbered sections (1-7), detailed subsections, and professional formatting. Data_Engineer_Response uses simple thought process format with minimal structure. Completely different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SAS_to_Python_Reviewer,95,"Lines 1-95","Well-formed markdown with proper structure, complete sentences, valid formatting, and comprehensive content. Minor inconsistency in metadata header format (Created on field populated when should be empty as noted in line 45)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Data_Engineer_Response,85,"Lines 1-3","Valid markdown format with proper code block syntax and clear communication. Syntactically correct but extremely brief and incomplete for the expected task scope."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically valid but vary significantly in completeness and scope."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SAS_to_Python_Reviewer,,"Lines 45, 67-75","Address metadata header format inconsistency. Consider adding more specific line-by-line code comparison details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Data_Engineer_Response,,"Lines 1-3","Complete the analysis task by providing the requested comparison once Python implementation is received. Current output is insufficient for the assigned comparison task."
