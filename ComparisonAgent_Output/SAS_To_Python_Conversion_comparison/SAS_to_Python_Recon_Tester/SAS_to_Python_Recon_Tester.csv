Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produce Python scripts for executing and comparing SAS and Python script outputs. Agent 1 uses saspy library integration while Agent 2 uses direct subprocess calls. Both achieve the same core functionality with different implementation approaches. Semantic similarity is high (85/100) as both address identical requirements. Structural similarity is good (78/100) with similar overall flow but different organizational patterns. Correctness is high for both agents (Agent 1: 92/100, Agent 2: 95/100) with minor syntax and reference issues."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both scripts serve identical purposes: executing SAS and Python scripts, then comparing their outputs for validation. Core functionality includes script execution, output comparison, and report generation. Agent 1 focuses on detailed logging and saspy integration, while Agent 2 emphasizes clean organization and comprehensive comparison reporting. The semantic intent and problem-solving approach are highly aligned despite implementation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"","Both follow similar high-level structure: imports, configuration, execution functions, comparison function, and main workflow. Agent 1 uses inline metadata generation (lines 12-18) while Agent 2 defines constants upfront (lines 9-16). Agent 1 has more granular error handling within functions, Agent 2 has cleaner separation with dedicated directory creation (line 18). Both use similar function decomposition but with different organizational philosophies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,92,"Lines 15, 31, 67","Agent 1 has minor issues: Line 15 uses f-string in metadata that could fail if datetime import issues occur. Line 31 has incomplete SAS submit block that may not properly export to CSV. Line 67 references undefined 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' variable name which appears to be a placeholder that wasn't properly replaced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Line 73","Agent 2 has excellent syntax correctness with one minor issue: Line 73 uses mismatches.to_string() without checking if mismatches DataFrame is empty, which could cause issues in edge cases. Otherwise, all imports are proper, variable references are consistent, and control flow is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"","Average correctness score across both agents. Both scripts are highly functional with only minor syntax and reference issues that would be easily caught in testing."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 31, 67","Fix incomplete SAS submission block to properly export results to CSV. Replace placeholder variable names with proper identifiers. Consider adding more robust error handling for saspy session management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Line 73","Add null check before calling to_string() on comparison results. Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging purposes similar to Agent 1's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both scripts would benefit from configuration file support for paths and parameters. Consider adding data validation checks beyond simple equality comparison. Implement retry logic for script execution failures."
