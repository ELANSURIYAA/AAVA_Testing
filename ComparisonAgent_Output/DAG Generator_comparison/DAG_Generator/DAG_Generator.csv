Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs are Airflow DAGs designed for ETL pipeline orchestration using medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold layers). Agent 1 implements Microsoft Fabric notebook execution with custom Python functions, while Agent 2 uses Databricks operators. Both follow similar structural patterns but differ significantly in implementation approach and technology stack."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both DAGs serve the same fundamental purpose of orchestrating ETL pipelines through Bronze/Silver/Gold layers. However, Agent 1 focuses on Microsoft Fabric with custom notebook execution functions, while Agent 2 uses Databricks operators. The semantic intent is highly aligned (data pipeline orchestration), but the execution platforms and methodologies differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 60-80, 120-180, 220-280","Both DAGs follow similar structural patterns: imports, constants, default_args, task definitions, and dependency chains. Agent 1 has more complex structure with custom functions (execute_fabric_notebook) and extensive error handling, while Agent 2 uses simpler operator-based approach. Task dependency patterns are comparable but Agent 1 has more granular validation steps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,88,"Lines 45, 78, 156","Agent 1 has mostly correct syntax with proper imports and variable usage. Minor issues: Line 45 has a potential token variable name issue (auth_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), Line 78 has a typo in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' instead of 'report', and Line 156 has inconsistent string formatting in some parameters."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 25, 89","Agent 2 has excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, consistent variable usage, and valid operator configurations. Minor issues: Line 25 has a comment inconsistency mentioning 'Azure Databricks notebooks' in Microsoft Fabric context, and Line 89 could benefit from more explicit error handling in the failure callback."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic validity with only minor issues that don't affect core functionality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Fix token variable naming convention on line 45, correct typo 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' to 'report' on line 78, and standardize parameter formatting throughout the DAG."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Update documentation comments to accurately reflect Microsoft Fabric instead of Azure Databricks on line 25, and enhance error handling in failure callback function on line 89."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Consider standardizing on a single platform approach (either Fabric or Databricks) for consistency. Both implementations would benefit from additional data quality validation steps and more comprehensive monitoring."
