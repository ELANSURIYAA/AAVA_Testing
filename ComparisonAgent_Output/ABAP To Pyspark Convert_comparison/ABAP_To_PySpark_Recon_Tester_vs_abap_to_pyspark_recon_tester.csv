Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt outputs robustly automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, including simulation, data export, transformation, and comparison. Semantic and structural similarity are very high, with minor divergence in error handling and configuration. Syntax correctness is excellent for both, with only small differences in parameterization and edge-case coverage. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts implement end-to-end ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, simulating ABAP output, transforming via PySpark, exporting to Parquet, transferring to storage, loading as external table, and comparing results. Both generate reconciliation reports and support automation. Minor differences exist in logging, configuration, and explicit support for multiple storage backends (2.0 1), but core intent and flow are aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"13-137,19-168","Both scripts follow a modular, stepwise structure: initialization, input parsing, simulated ABAP execution, CSV to Parquet conversion, transfer to storage, PySpark transformation, result comparison, and report generation. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt introduces additional config sections and utility functions, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt integrates pytest test cases inline. Slightly different ordering and decomposition, but overall flow is highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,99,"1-168","Script is syntactically correct, follows Python and PySpark standards, and includes integrated pytest tests. Minor improvement possible by parameterizing file paths and using environment variables for configs (see lines 18, 153)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,98,"1-187","Script is syntactically correct with advanced config handling, logging, and utility functions. Minor issues: usage of os.rename for local file transfer (line 88) can fail if source and destination are on different filesystems; error handling for missing ABAP CSV is less explicit (lines 60-61)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (99) and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (98)."
