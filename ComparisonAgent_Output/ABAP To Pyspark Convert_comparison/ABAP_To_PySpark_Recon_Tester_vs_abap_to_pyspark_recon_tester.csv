Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester and abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester provide comprehensive migration validation scripts for ABAP to PySpark, featuring robust ETL simulation, data export, distributed storage, comparison logic, and reporting. Semantic and structural similarity are very high, with minor differences in implementation details and error handling. Syntax correctness is perfect for both scripts. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of validating ABAP-to-PySpark migration through simulated ETL, transformation, and reconciliation reporting. Minor differences exist in field naming, configuration usage, and the level of abstraction, but both scripts produce a detailed reconciliation report and robust comparison logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-95 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester), 1-137 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester)","Both scripts follow a similar flow: input parsing, simulated ABAP execution, CSV to Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark external table creation, transformation, result comparison, and report generation. abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester adds more modular configuration, explicit environment variable usage, and transfer logic for S3/HDFS/Local, while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester includes integrated pytest test cases and more granular transformation validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester,100,,"No syntax errors, broken references, or undefined variables detected in ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester. All imports, class/method definitions, and test cases are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester,100,,"No syntax errors, broken references, or undefined variables detected in abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester. All imports, configuration sections, and workflow logic are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester (100) and abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester (100)."
