Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,94,,"Both scripts robustly automate ABAP to PySpark migration validation, including simulation, data export, comparison, and reconciliation reporting. Semantic intent and core steps are strongly aligned. Structure is similar but with differences: '1.0 1' provides more detailed inline error handling, test cases, and explicit transformation logic, while '2.0 1' emphasizes configuration, external connections, and generalized data comparison. Both are syntactically correct; minor issues are noted in modularity and error reporting granularity. Overall score: 94/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs target the automated validation of ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including simulation of execution, transformation, export, and reconciliation. The intent and overall workflow are nearly identical, with only minor emphasis differences (e.g., test coverage and explicit logging in '1.0 1', broader config and storage abstraction in '2.0 1')."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,91,"1-180 ('1.0 1'), 1-210 ('2.0 1')","Both scripts share a similar high-level structure: initialization, ABAP code parsing/execution, CSV-to-Parquet export, transfer to storage, PySpark load/transform, comparison, and reconciliation report. '1.0 1' embeds test cases and more granular function separation, while '2.0 1' centralizes configuration and uses a more monolithic main function. Some steps (e.g., explicit pytest suite in '1.0 1', external config in '2.0 1') diverge structurally."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"'1.0 1' is syntactically correct Python throughout, with valid imports, class/function structure, and no undefined variables or syntax errors detected. Pytest script at end is also well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,98,"125, 163","'2.0 1' is syntactically correct overall, but has minor issues: use of os.rename may fail if source/target are on different filesystems (line 125); handling of missing DataFrame ('renamed_df') could be more robust (line 163). Otherwise, no syntax errors or undefined references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of 100 ('1.0 1') and 98 ('2.0 1')."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"125","Replace os.rename with shutil.move or copy for cross-filesystem safety."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"163","Add explicit error message or fallback if 'renamed_df' is not present in PySpark namespace."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,"1-180","Consider modularizing test cases into a separate file/package for production maintainability."
