Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both scripts automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, with strong semantic and structural alignment. Minor differences in environment setup and error handling, but both achieve the core reconciliation/reporting goal. Syntax is robust in both, with only superficial differences (e.g., logging style, config blocks). Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both outputs implement a comprehensive workflow for ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, including table extraction, simulated execution, data transformation, output comparison, and reconciliation report generation. The intent, process, and outcomes are highly aligned. Minor semantic divergence: Agent '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' emphasizes test cases and coverage, while Agent '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' focuses more on config/environment flexibility and integration."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"1-74, 75-180 (Agent 1); 1-136 (Agent 2)","Both scripts follow nearly identical validation structure: initialization, ABAP parsing/execution, PySpark transformation, data export, distributed storage transfer, external table creation, result comparison, and report generation. Agent '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' includes a pytest suite for transformation logic (lines 75-180), which is not present in Agent '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt'. Agent '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' uses more explicit configuration/environment blocks (lines 1-37) and abstracts utility functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"Syntax is valid throughout. All imports, class definitions, functions, and test cases are well-formed. No undefined variables, broken references, or indentation errors found."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,99,"30-42, 85-109","Minor issues: In the simulated ABAP execution block (lines 30-42), the CSV fallback path is hardcoded and may not exist in some environments. In the PySpark code execution block (lines 85-109), reliance on 'exec' with namespace may introduce subtle runtime risks, but does not break syntax. Otherwise, syntax is robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of Agent '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' (100) and Agent '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' (99) rounded up."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,,"1-74","Consider adding flexible config/environment blocks as in Agent '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' for improved integration."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,,"75-180","Consider adding explicit transformation test suite as in Agent '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' to strengthen validation coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,,"30-42, 85-109","Avoid hardcoded fallback paths and consider safer alternatives to 'exec' for PySpark code execution."
