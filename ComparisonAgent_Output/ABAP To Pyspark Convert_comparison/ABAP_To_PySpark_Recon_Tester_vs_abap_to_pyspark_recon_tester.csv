Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,95,,"Both agent outputs (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt) implement comprehensive ABAP to PySpark migration validation workflows, including simulation, transformation, reconciliation reporting, and robust error handling. Both scripts automate validation, produce detailed reports, and support auditability. Minor differences exist in configuration and integration depth. Semantic similarity is very high (95/100). Structural similarity is strong (91/100) with minor differences in configuration, external system integration, and utility abstraction. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100). Overall score: 95/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"1-172, 1-180","Both outputs address the same migration validation goal, simulate ABAP execution, process data, perform PySpark transformations, compare results, and generate reconciliation reports. Both handle error cases, support automation, and logging. Minor semantic divergence: 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt includes explicit environment variable usage and S3/HDFS integration, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt uses local simulation and hardcoded paths. Both scripts allow for real migration integration."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,91,"1-172, 1-180","Both scripts follow a modular, stepwise workflow: initialization, ABAP code parsing/execution, simulated or real data acquisition, CSV/Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark processing, result comparison, and report generation. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt splits utilities and config into explicit sections and supports multiple storage backends, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt uses a class-based approach and single simulated storage. Minor structural divergence: 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses more utility functions and config abstraction (lines 15-60), while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt integrates all logic into class methods."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,"1-172","No syntax errors detected. All imports, class definitions, function calls, and exception handling are correct. Pytest script is syntactically valid and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,100,"1-180","No syntax errors detected. All imports, function definitions, configuration, logging, and main workflow are internally consistent. Utility functions, error handling, and environment variable usage are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (100) and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,"15-60","Consider refactoring configuration and storage handling for greater flexibility (e.g., environment variables, S3/HDFS support) as in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"1-172","Consider consolidating utility functions and main workflow into a class for easier extensibility, as seen in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt."
