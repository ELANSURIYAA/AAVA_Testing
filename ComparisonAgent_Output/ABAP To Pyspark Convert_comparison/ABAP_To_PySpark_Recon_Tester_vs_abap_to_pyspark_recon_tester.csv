Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,94,,"Both scripts automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, covering data extraction, transformation, export, and reconciliation with robust error handling. Semantic and structural similarity is high (95/92), with minor differences in modularization and configuration. Syntax correctness is strong: ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt is perfect (100/100), abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt has minor optional import issues (line 25). Overall score: 94/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs implement a comprehensive workflow for ABAP-to-PySpark migration testing: parsing ABAP and PySpark code, simulating/executing data extraction, exporting to Parquet, transferring to distributed storage, loading via PySpark, running transformations, and generating reconciliation reports. Minor divergence: ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes explicit test cases via pytest, while abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt emphasizes configuration and real SAP connectivity. Both reach the same validation goals."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"1-290 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt), 1-205 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)","Both scripts follow a logical, staged sequence: initialization, parsing, data simulation/extraction, conversion/export, transfer, PySpark transformation, comparison, and reporting. abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses more configuration blocks and utility functions, while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt is more monolithic with an embedded pytest section. Both maintain a single main entry point and robust error handling. Minor differences in how modularization and configuration are handled."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports are valid, classes and functions are well-formed, and pytest section is syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,96,"25, 38, 49","Minor: Optional imports (pyRFC, boto3) are handled with try/except; if not present, Connection/boto3 are set to None, so script doesn't break, but this could lead to runtime issues if SAP/S3 features are invoked without guards (lines 25, 38, 49). Otherwise, syntax is valid throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of 100 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt) and 96 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"25, 38, 49","Add explicit guards or user-facing error messages when Connection or boto3 is None to prevent accidental invocation of unavailable features."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,,"Consider modularizing configuration and logging for greater maintainability, as done in abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt."
