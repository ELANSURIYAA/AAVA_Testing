Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,95,,"Both migration validation scripts implement robust, end-to-end ABAP to PySpark reconciliation workflows, with highly aligned intent and comparable outcomes. Minor differences exist in the structure and emphasis: /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes an embedded pytest suite, while /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt focuses on advanced configuration, storage abstraction, and logging. Both scripts are syntactically correct, with only superficial style and modularity differences. Overall, both provide enterprise-grade, auditable, and automatable solutions for ABAP to PySpark migration validation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs target automated, auditable validation of ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including end-to-end data extraction, transformation, and result comparison. Both scripts implement ABAP code simulation, CSV/Parquet conversion, PySpark execution, and reconciliation report generation. Differences are mostly in implementation detail: /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt adds modular storage abstraction and more real-world config, while /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes inline pytest test cases for transformation logic. Intent and meaning are fully aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"~lines 250-400 in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt","Both scripts share the same overall flow: initialization, ABAP/PySpark code parsing, simulated ABAP execution, CSV to Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark DataFrame processing, result comparison, and JSON report generation. /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt embeds a large pytest test suite after the main script (lines ~250+), whereas /src/217f5092-dd22-4120-9031-d196d5f813ac/2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt has a more monolithic structure with all logic in one file and a focus on real-world integration and logging. Minor differences in modularization and error handling, but all core phases are present in both."
