Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,93,,"Both ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt deliver robust ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation frameworks. They share high semantic and structural alignment, including simulation of ABAP execution, CSV-to-Parquet conversion, distributed storage handling, Spark session orchestration, and detailed reconciliation/reporting. ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes a full pytest test suite for transformation validation and more explicit error handling, while abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt features advanced configuration, broader storage options, and stricter logging and auditability. Both scripts are syntactically correct, with minor docstring and import ordering issues. Overall, both are enterprise-grade, with minor differences in extensibility, modularity, and validation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs achieve the same intent: validating ABAP-to-PySpark migration by simulating execution, performing data export, and comparing results. Both generate reconciliation reports, support automation, and address error handling and auditability (see lines 1-100+ in both files). Minor divergence: abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt is more configurable and targets broader storage, while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes detailed test coverage and more explicit transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,91,"1-270 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt), 1-230 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)","Both scripts follow a modular structure: main workflow, utility functions, configuration, and reporting. ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt encapsulates logic in a class and includes a full pytest script (lines 153-270), while abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses a function-based approach and puts more configuration up front (lines 12-90). Both orchestrate Spark, storage, and comparison, but differ in decomposition style and test integration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors found. All imports, class/method definitions, and test cases are valid. Logging, exception handling, and resource management are properly implemented (lines 1-270)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,98,"1-230","Minor docstring style mismatch (lines 1-5), import grouping could be improved, and the main() method does not check for file existence before reading (lines 184-195), but code is otherwise syntactically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (100) and abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (98)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"1-5, 184-195","Refine docstring style (lines 1-5), group imports more clearly, and add file existence checks before reading ABAP/PySpark code files (lines 184-195) for improved robustness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,"153-270","Extract pytest script (lines 153-270) into a separate file/module to match modularity and improve maintainability. Consider supporting more flexible storage and configuration as in abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt."
