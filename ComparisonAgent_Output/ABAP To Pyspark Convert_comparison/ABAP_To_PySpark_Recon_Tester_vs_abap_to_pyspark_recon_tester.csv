Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,94,,"Both scripts automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation with strong semantic and structural alignment. Minor differences exist in configuration generalization and test coverage. Syntax is nearly perfect, with only a minor logging config issue in abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester (line 35). Overall score: 94/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both scripts perform ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, simulating ABAP outputs, converting to Parquet, transferring to storage, loading via Spark, transforming, and generating reconciliation reports. Intent and outcome are aligned, with only minor differences in how configuration and credentials are handled."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"1-110 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester), 1-165 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester)","Both scripts follow similar phases: initialization, ABAP parse/simulation, CSV-to-Parquet, storage transfer, Spark load/transform, comparison, and reporting. abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester generalizes config (lines 20-60), while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester includes more explicit test cases and docstrings (lines 120-220)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors found. All imports, classes, and function definitions are valid. Logging and error handling are robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,98,"35","Minor issue: logging.basicConfig sets filename but also prints log messages, which can cause duplicate outputs (line 35). Otherwise, syntax is valid."
