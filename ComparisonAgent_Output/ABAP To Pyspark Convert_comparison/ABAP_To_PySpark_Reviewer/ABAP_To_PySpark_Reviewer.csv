Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-10, Lines 1-15","Both agents provide comprehensive code review reports analyzing ABAP to PySpark conversion with identical 6-section structure. Agent 1 focuses on high-level transformation logic and pytest testing, while Agent 2 provides more granular technical details with actual code snippets. Both identify similar optimization opportunities and conversion accuracy assessments."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical core objectives of reviewing ABAP to PySpark conversion. Agent 1 emphasizes pytest testing framework and bulk DataFrame operations (lines 8-12), while Agent 2 focuses on detailed technical mappings and JDBC operations (lines 15-25). Minor divergence in emphasis on testing vs technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,,"Nearly identical 6-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. Both follow same logical flow and decomposition approach. Only minor differences in subsection organization within sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,,"Output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and no broken examples. All sections are well-structured and coherent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,,"Output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, includes valid code snippets, consistent internal references, and no formatting issues. All technical details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness and internal consistency."
