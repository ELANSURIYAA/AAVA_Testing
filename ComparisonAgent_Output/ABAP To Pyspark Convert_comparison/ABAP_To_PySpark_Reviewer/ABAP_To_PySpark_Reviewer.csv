Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50, Lines 1-100","Both outputs provide comprehensive code review reports comparing ABAP to PySpark conversion. The first output focuses on general transformation accuracy and optimization suggestions, while the second output provides more structured analysis with detailed section-by-section comparison. Both identify key conversion aspects including file handling, data validation, error management, and performance optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, Lines 1-30","Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing ABAP to PySpark conversion. They share similar themes around conversion accuracy, error handling improvements, and optimization recommendations. However, the second output provides more granular analysis with specific technical details and structured formatting, while the first is more narrative-focused."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 21-50, Lines 31-80","Both outputs follow a structured approach with numbered sections covering Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Issues/Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. The second output has more detailed subsections and technical specificity, while the first uses a more flowing narrative structure within each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First Output,95,"Lines 10-15, Lines 25-30","Minor issues with terminology consistency - uses 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' instead of 'report' in line 15. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper section numbering and coherent technical content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second Output,98,"Lines 40-45, Lines 70-75","Highly structured and syntactically correct. Consistent formatting, proper technical terminology, and well-organized subsections. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point alignment but otherwise excellent structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,First Output,,"Lines 45-50","Enhance error handling, add schema validation, implement caching mechanisms, optimize partitioning, expand testing coverage, and incorporate detailed logging and monitoring tools."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second Output,,"Lines 85-100","Enable data type casting, improve row validation, enhance error logging, optimize performance through partitioning and caching, review transaction management, automate testing, and document assumptions clearly."
