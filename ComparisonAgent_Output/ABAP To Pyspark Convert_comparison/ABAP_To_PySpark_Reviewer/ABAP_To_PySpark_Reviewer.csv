Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs deliver thorough code review reports comparing ABAP to PySpark conversion for finance data loading, with high semantic and structural alignment. Minor differences exist in the focus and depth of certain issues (e.g., type casting and transaction control). Both are syntactically correct, with AAVA_2.0 including inlined code samples. Overall, both are robust reviews with small divergences in detail and presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"1-38 (AAVA_1.0), 1-119 (AAVA_2.0)","Both reviews address the same core objective: validating the fidelity and quality of ABAP-to-PySpark conversion for SAP BW finance data loading. Both cover file handling, data parsing/validation, error handling, data loading, and optimization. AAVA_2.0 provides slightly more detail on transaction control and type casting. Minor differences in emphasis and code excerpt inclusion do not affect overall intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Sections 2-6 (AAVA_1.0), Sections 2-6 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs use a highly similar sectioned structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. AAVA_2.0 inlines annotated code (lines 38-119), increasing report length and detail. Section order and flow are nearly identical, with AAVA_2.0 adding direct ABAP/PySpark code for illustration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,"1-38","AAVA_1.0 is well-structured, with no syntax, formatting, or internal consistency errors. Section headers, bullet points, and recommendations are clear and correctly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,"1-119","AAVA_2.0 is also syntactically correct. Markdown, bullet points, and embedded code blocks are properly formatted. No broken references or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct, so average correctness is 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"38-119 (AAVA_2.0)","If brevity is desired, consider moving full code listings to appendices or hyperlinks, as inlined code greatly increases report length."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"Section 3, 4 (both)","Both reports should ensure recommendations on transaction management and type casting are emphasized in the executive summary for maximum stakeholder visibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"Section 3 (AAVA_1.0)","AAVA_1.0 could further detail transaction control and type casting, as highlighted in AAVA_2.0, to enhance completeness."
