Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were provided as placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) rather than actual content. The comparison framework is ready but requires actual agent outputs to execute semantic, structural, and correctness analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent output content. The evaluation would compare intent, meaning, and purpose alignment between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent output content. The evaluation would compare logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without access to actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without access to actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To execute proper comparison: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables, 2) Ensure outputs contain identifiable content for semantic analysis, 3) Verify outputs have proper structure for structural comparison, 4) Include syntax-checkable content for correctness evaluation."
