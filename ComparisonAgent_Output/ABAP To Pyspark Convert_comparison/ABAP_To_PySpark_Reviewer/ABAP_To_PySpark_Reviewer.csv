Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs achieve high semantic similarity (95/100), with minor differences in terminology and emphasis. Structural similarity is strong (92/100), but AAVA_1.0 omits code snippets present in AAVA_2.0 (see lines 90-170). Syntax correctness is perfect for AAVA_1.0 (100/100) and AAVA_2.0 (100/100). Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs address the same core objective: reviewing and validating an ABAP to PySpark code conversion. Both analyze conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimizations, and recommendations. Minor emphasis differences: AAVA_1.0 focuses more on high-level transformation and testing coverage, while AAVA_2.0 provides more granular mapping of ABAP to PySpark constructs and includes inline code listings. Both reach equivalent conclusions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"90-170","Both outputs use an executive summary, conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, overall assessment, and recommendations. AAVA_2.0 includes full ABAP and PySpark code listings (lines 90-170), which are referenced but not quoted in AAVA_1.0. Otherwise, the flow and sectioning are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"AAVA_1.0 is internally consistent, well-formatted, and free from syntax or structural errors. Section headers, content, and recommendations are clear."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"AAVA_2.0 is internally consistent, with all sections, markdown, and code blocks properly formatted. No broken references or syntax errors detected in either the review text or included code snippets."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both agents scored 100 for syntax-level correctness; average is 100."
