Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive code review reports for ABAP to PySpark conversion. Agent 1 focuses on high-level analysis with business logic preservation, while Agent 2 includes actual code examples and more technical implementation details. Both identify similar issues around error handling, schema validation, and optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 45-65","Both outputs address the same core goal of reviewing ABAP to PySpark conversion. They share similar conclusions about business logic preservation, performance improvements, and areas needing enhancement. However, Agent 2 provides more concrete technical details with actual code examples, while Agent 1 remains more conceptual."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-6, 20-25, 40-45","Both outputs follow nearly identical 6-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. The logical flow and decomposition approach are very similar with consistent section ordering."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Code_Review_Report,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Well-formed report structure with consistent internal references. Minor issue: mentions 'pytest script' in summary but doesn't provide the actual script code, creating a slight inconsistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Similar_Structure_Report,98,"Lines 50-150, 200-250","Excellent syntax and structure with actual code examples properly formatted. ABAP and PySpark code blocks are syntactically correct and well-documented. Internal references are consistent throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
