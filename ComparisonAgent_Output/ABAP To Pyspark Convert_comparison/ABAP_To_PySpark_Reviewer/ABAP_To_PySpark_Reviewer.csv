Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not populated with actual agent outputs. This appears to be a template or configuration issue rather than actual comparison data."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Both inputs appear to be template placeholders rather than substantive content for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No meaningful structure to analyze in the provided template variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 1 output as no actual content was provided - only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 2 output as no actual content was provided - only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to absence of actual agent outputs to evaluate. This represents a data availability issue rather than agent performance."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify that agent outputs are properly populated before running comparison analysis. 2. Check template variable substitution in the input pipeline. 3. Ensure actual agent execution results are captured and passed to the comparison agent. 4. Re-run comparison once valid agent outputs are available."
