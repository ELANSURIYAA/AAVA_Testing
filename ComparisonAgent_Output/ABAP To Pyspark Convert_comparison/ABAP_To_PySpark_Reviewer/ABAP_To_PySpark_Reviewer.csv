Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive code review reports comparing ABAP to PySpark conversion with identical 6-section structure. Agent 1 focuses more on high-level transformation concepts and scalability benefits, while Agent 2 provides more detailed technical analysis with specific code examples and line-by-line comparisons. Both maintain professional quality and cover essential aspects of code conversion review."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing ABAP to PySpark conversion. Agent 1 emphasizes scalability and modern DataFrame operations, while Agent 2 focuses on detailed technical mapping and specific implementation differences. The intent and purpose are highly aligned, with Agent 2 providing more granular technical details and Agent 1 offering broader strategic insights."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"All sections (Agent 1), All sections (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow identical structural organization with 6 main sections: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. The logical flow and section decomposition are nearly identical, with only minor variations in subsection organization within each main section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Well-formed document with consistent structure. Minor issues: Some technical claims about 'bulk DataFrame operations' could be more specific (line 15-20), and the aggregation example in Summary section (lines 35-40) doesn't fully align with the actual PySpark code shown which focuses on data loading rather than aggregation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,"Lines 25-30, 45-50","Highly accurate technical analysis with specific code references. Very minor issues: The row validation critique (lines 25-30) could be clearer about the specific DataFrame method, and some JDBC transaction management claims (lines 45-50) make assumptions about SAP BW connectivity that aren't fully substantiated."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper document structure, consistent internal references, and technically sound analysis. Agent 2 shows slightly higher technical precision while Agent 1 provides broader strategic context."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance technical specificity by providing more detailed code examples and line-by-line analysis. Include more specific references to actual implementation details rather than high-level concepts. Consider adding more granular error handling examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain the excellent technical depth while adding more strategic context about scalability benefits and business value. Consider including more discussion of the broader architectural implications of the ABAP to PySpark migration."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Including actual performance benchmarks or metrics, 2) Adding specific testing strategies beyond the pytest examples, 3) Providing more detailed migration timeline and resource requirements, 4) Including specific SAP BW integration patterns and best practices."
