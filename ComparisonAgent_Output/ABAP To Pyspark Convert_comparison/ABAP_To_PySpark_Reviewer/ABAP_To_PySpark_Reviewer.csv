Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided in the input. Only placeholder text was received instead of the actual ABAP to PySpark conversion outputs from both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text does not contain meaningful content for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No code structure or logical flow available for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual ABAP to PySpark conversion code from first agent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual ABAP to PySpark conversion code from second agent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs containing ABAP to PySpark conversion code for meaningful comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Ensure agent outputs include complete code transformations with proper syntax and structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Include metadata about conversion approach and any assumptions made during the transformation process."
