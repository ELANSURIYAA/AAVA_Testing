Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided. Input contained template placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual agent outputs. A valid comparison requires concrete outputs from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template placeholders were provided instead of concrete content for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No concrete structure or logic flow available for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform a valid comparison: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of template placeholders, 2) Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted, 3) Include context about the task both agents were attempting to solve, 4) Specify the expected output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test case) for appropriate evaluation criteria."
