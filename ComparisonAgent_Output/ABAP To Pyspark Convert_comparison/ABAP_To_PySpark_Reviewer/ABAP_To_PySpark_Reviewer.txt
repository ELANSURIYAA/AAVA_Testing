Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs provide comprehensive code review and conversion analysis from ABAP to PySpark, with high semantic and structural alignment. Minor differences exist in the emphasis on schema validation, error handling, and technical details, but both achieve the intended goal. Syntax is perfect for both (100/100). Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both outputs deliver a detailed review comparing ABAP and PySpark implementations for finance data loading. They address the same goals (data ingestion, transformation, validation, and error handling), and both propose improvements. Minor divergence: AAVA_2.0 gives more granular code snippets and technical details; AAVA_1.0 emphasizes performance and test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-6","Both follow a parallel structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Assessment, Recommendations. AAVA_2.0 embeds code samples inline and has slightly more granular breakdowns, while AAVA_1.0 provides a more narrative flow and explicit test suite discussion."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected. All sections are well-structured, no undefined terms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected. All code samples and narrative are internally consistent and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of AAVA_1.0 (100) and AAVA_2.0 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_1.0,,"2-3","Consider including explicit inline ABAP and PySpark code samples for technical traceability and easier audit, as shown in AAVA_2.0."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_2.0,,"3-4","Clarify and expand on the test coverage discussion, as highlighted in AAVA_1.0, to improve assurance and auditability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"5-6","Both outputs could benefit from a unified section mapping ABAP constructs directly to PySpark equivalents for easier cross-referencing."
