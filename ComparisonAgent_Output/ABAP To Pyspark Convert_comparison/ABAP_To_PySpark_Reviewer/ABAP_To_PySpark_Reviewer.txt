Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,94,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs provide comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark code review reports. Both address the same conversion scenario, cover transformation accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization, and include recommendations. Structural and semantic alignment is strong, with AAVA_2.0 providing more explicit code excerpts and slightly deeper technical detail. Both outputs are syntactically correct. Overall score: 94/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,93,,"Both reports address the same ABAP-to-PySpark conversion review, analyzing transformation accuracy, discrepancies, optimization, and recommendations. AAVA_2.0 includes more explicit code snippets and implementation details, while AAVA_1.0 focuses more on summary and business logic coverage. The intent and meaning are highly aligned, with only minor emphasis differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"1-60","Both outputs follow a similar logical structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, and Recommendations. AAVA_2.0 embeds explicit code sections (ABAP and PySpark) and is more granular in technical breakdowns, while AAVA_1.0 is more narrative. The order and sectioning are nearly identical, with minor differences in the depth of each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"No syntactic or formatting errors detected. Sections are properly delimited and the report is internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"No syntactic or formatting errors detected. Code blocks are properly formatted and the report is internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct. Average: (100+100)/2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-60","AAVA_1.0 could be improved by including explicit code excerpts (as in AAVA_2.0) for greater technical clarity. Both agents should ensure that recommendations are mapped directly to code lines or sections for traceability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-60","AAVA_2.0 could provide more high-level summary and business logic context in the executive summary, as seen in AAVA_1.0, to balance technical and business perspectives."
