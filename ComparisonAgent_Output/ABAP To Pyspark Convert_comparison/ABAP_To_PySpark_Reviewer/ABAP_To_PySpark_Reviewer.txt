# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 95/100**
- Both AgentA and AgentB outputs achieve high semantic similarity (95/100), with only minor differences in terminology and presentation.
- Structural similarity is strong (92/100), though AgentB omits a key section present in AgentA (lines 15-19).
- Syntax correctness is perfect for AgentA (100/100), while AgentB contains a minor formatting error (line 23).
- Overall, both outputs meet the core objectives, with AgentA slightly more complete and polished.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective with aligned intent. Minor terminology and emphasis differences are present but do not impact the overall meaning. Both apply equivalent transformations and reach the same conclusions.

**Key Observations:**
- Both AgentA and AgentB interpret and solve the task in the same way.
- Differences in word choice and presentation are superficial.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Overall flow is identical, with the same logical decomposition. However, AgentB omits a section present in AgentA at lines 15-19, resulting in minor structural divergence.

**Key Observations:**
- Logical blocks and control flow are closely matched.
- Missing section in AgentB (lines 15-19) is the primary divergence.

### Correctness

**AgentA: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**AgentB: 98/100**

- Minor formatting error at line 23.
- Otherwise, syntax is valid with no undefined variables or broken references.

**Overall Correctness: 99/100**

- Average of AgentA (100) and AgentB (98).

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AgentA | AgentB | Overall |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 95     | 95     | 95      |
| Structural Similarity | 92     | 92     | 92      |
| Correctness           | 100    | 98     | 99      |
| **Overall**           | -      | -      | **95**  |

## Recommendations

- **AgentB (lines 15-19):** Add the missing section identified at lines 15-19 to match AgentA's structure.
- **AgentB (line 23):** Fix the formatting error at line 23 for full syntactic correctness.
