# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 94/100**
- Both outputs demonstrate high semantic similarity (93/100) and structural similarity (92/100), with minor differences in terminology and the order of logical blocks. Syntax correctness is perfect for both outputs (100/100 each). There are no critical errors, and both outputs fulfill the intended objective.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 93/100)

- **Analysis:** Both AgentOutputA and AgentOutputB address the same core objective and demonstrate aligned intent. Minor terminology differences and slightly different phrasing are present, but both apply equivalent reasoning and reach the same conclusions.
- **Key Observations:** The outputs are semantically aligned, with only superficial differences.
- **Line References:** N/A (differences are distributed and minor).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- **Analysis:** Both outputs use nearly identical logical decomposition and flow, but there is a minor difference in the order of logical blocks.
- **Key Observations:** In AgentOutputA (lines 6-11), the order of blocks differs from AgentOutputB (lines 5-10), resulting in a slight structural divergence.
- **Line References:** AgentOutputA lines 6-11 vs. AgentOutputB lines 5-10.

### Correctness

**AgentOutputA: 100/100**
- Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.
- **Line References:** N/A

**AgentOutputB: 100/100**
- Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.
- **Line References:** N/A

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AgentOutputA | AgentOutputB | Overall |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 93           | 93           | 93      |
| Structural Similarity | 92           | 92           | 92      |
| Correctness           | 100          | 100          | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -            | -            | **94**  |

## Recommendations

- **AgentOutputA (lines 6-11):** Consider aligning the order of logical blocks with AgentOutputB (lines 5-10) for improved structural consistency.
- **AgentOutputB (lines 5-10):** Consider aligning the order of logical blocks with AgentOutputA (lines 6-11) for improved structural consistency.
