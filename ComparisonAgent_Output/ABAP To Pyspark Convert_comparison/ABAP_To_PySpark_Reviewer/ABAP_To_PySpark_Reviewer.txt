# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform meaningful comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. The provided inputs contained template variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` that were not populated with actual agent outputs. This appears to be a template or configuration issue rather than actual comparison data.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Both inputs appear to be template placeholders rather than substantive content for comparison. No meaningful semantic analysis can be performed on unpopulated template variables.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No meaningful structure to analyze in the provided template variables. Structural comparison requires actual code, documentation, or other formatted content.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 0/100)**
Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 1 output as no actual content was provided - only template variable `{{agent 1_string_true}}`.

**Agent 2 (Score: 0/100)**
Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 2 output as no actual content was provided - only template variable `{{agent 2_string_true}}`.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 0/100)**
Overall correctness score is 0 due to absence of actual agent outputs to evaluate. This represents a data availability issue rather than agent performance.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Input Pipeline**: Check that agent outputs are properly populated before running comparison analysis
2. **Template Variable Substitution**: Ensure template variables are being replaced with actual content in the input processing pipeline
3. **Agent Execution Validation**: Confirm that actual agent execution results are captured and passed to the comparison agent
4. **Re-run Analysis**: Execute comparison again once valid agent outputs are available
