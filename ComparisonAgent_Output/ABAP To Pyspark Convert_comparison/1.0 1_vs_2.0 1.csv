Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' and '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' deliver robust and comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation automation scripts, with strong semantic and structural alignment. The main differences are in configuration, logging, and minor implementation details. Both scripts are syntactically valid, with only superficial differences in error handling and environment abstraction. Overall, both provide highly effective, automatable validation frameworks with minor style and interface divergences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts automate the ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation workflow, including ABAP/PySpark code parsing, simulated or real ABAP execution, CSV/Parquet conversion, PySpark table loading, transformation, comparison, and reconciliation reporting. '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' is more simulation-focused while '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' includes real SAP/Boto3 hooks. Both achieve the same validation objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-150 (1.0 1), 1-160 (2.0 1)","Overall structure is nearly identical: both scripts follow a stepwise validation pipeline with modular, reusable functions/classes. '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' splits more logic into utility functions and supports more storage types and configuration via environment variables (lines 35-90), whereas '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' uses a class-based approach and hardcoded simulation paths. Minor differences in error handling and logging structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, class/method definitions, and test cases are syntactically correct. Logging, file operations, and Spark session handling are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,99,"35-90","All syntax is valid. Minor issue: some code paths (e.g., S3/HDFS transfer) may reference undefined environment variables or missing libraries, but these are conditionally handled. Logging and try/except blocks are robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of both scripts: (100 + 99)//2 = 99.5, rounded to 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"35-90 (2.0 1)","Consider harmonizing configuration handling in '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' to match the environment-driven, flexible approach in '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt'."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-150 (1.0 1), 1-160 (2.0 1)","Unify error handling and logging style for consistency and auditability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"","No syntax errors require correction in either script. Both are ready for integration and automation."
