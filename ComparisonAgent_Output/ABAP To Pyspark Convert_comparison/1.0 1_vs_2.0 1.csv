Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt provide comprehensive Python scripts for ABAP to PySpark migration validation, including robust documentation, error handling, and reconciliation reporting. Semantic and structural alignment is very high, with minor differences in configuration and integration details. Both scripts are syntactically correct and production-ready, with minor style and integration differences. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,"1-120 (1.0 1), 1-130 (2.0 1)","Both scripts implement end-to-end ABAP to PySpark validation workflows, simulate ABAP execution, convert outputs, transfer to distributed storage, and compare results. Minor differences: 2.0 1 integrates more configurable storage and SAP connection parameters, while 1.0 1 provides more granular logging and embedded pytest coverage. Both reach identical outcomes and report formats."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"1-120 (1.0 1), 1-130 (2.0 1)","Both scripts follow similar stepwise orchestration: initialization, ABAP parsing/simulation, CSV/Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark transformation, result comparison, and reconciliation reporting. 2.0 1 places more emphasis on configuration blocks and external connections, while 1.0 1 embeds detailed class-based structure and test suite at the end. Differences are minor and do not affect workflow fidelity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors, all imports and references are valid, functions and classes are well-formed, and pytest script at end is executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,99,"17, 64-67, 122","No syntax errors, all imports and references are valid. Minor issue: os.rename in transfer_to_storage could fail if source and destination are on different filesystems (suggest using shutil.move for robustness). Otherwise, all control flow and references are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of both agents: (100 + 99) / 2 = 99.5 (rounded to 100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"17, 64-67","Replace os.rename with shutil.move in transfer_to_storage for better cross-filesystem compatibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,"121-150","Consider externalizing configuration (SAP connection, storage paths) for improved portability and auditability, as seen in 2.0 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"1-130","Both agents could benefit from harmonizing test coverage (embed pytest in 2.0 1 or externalize in 1.0 1) and expanding schema validation logic in comparison steps."
