Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,98,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs automate and validate ABAP to PySpark migration, including simulation, transformation, storage, and reconciliation reporting. Minor differences exist in code modularity, configuration, and coverage of edge cases, but overall semantic and structural alignment is high. Syntax correctness is perfect for both outputs. Overall score: 98/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,"1-212, 1-180","Both outputs address ABAP to PySpark migration validation, simulating ABAP execution, transforming and exporting data, running PySpark logic, comparing results, and generating reconciliation reports. 2.0 1 adds more explicit edge-case handling and configuration, but the core meaning and intent are aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"1-212, 1-180","Both outputs follow similar stepwise flow: initialization, parsing, simulation, conversion, transfer, PySpark execution, comparison, reporting, and error handling. 2.0 1 separates configuration and utility functions, while 1.0 1 uses a class-based structure. 1.0 1 also includes a pytest suite (lines 143-212) for transformation logic, which is not present in 2.0 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"Syntax is valid throughout for 1.0 1. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected in either the main script or the pytest suite (lines 143-212)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,100,,"Syntax is valid throughout for 2.0 1. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected. All imports, function definitions, and main workflow are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 1.0 1 (100) and 2.0 1 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,"143-212","Consider porting the pytest suite from 1.0 1 to 2.0 1 to strengthen automated testing of transformation scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"1-60","Consider modularizing the main workflow in 2.0 1 using a class structure for maintainability, similar to 1.0 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"1-180, 1-212","Both scripts could harmonize configuration management and edge-case coverage for even greater reliability and auditability."
