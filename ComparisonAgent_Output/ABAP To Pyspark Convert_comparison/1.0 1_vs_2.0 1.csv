Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,92,,"Both '1.0 1' and '2.0 1' outputs deliver comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation scripts with strong semantic and structural alignment. Minor differences exist in configuration, modularization, and external dependency handling. Correctness is high for both, with only superficial issues such as unused imports and minor inconsistencies in logging or error handling. Overall, both outputs achieve the intended validation workflow and are robust for enterprise use."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-240;1-177,"Both scripts implement an automated, auditable validation workflow for ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including data extraction, transformation, export, distributed storage simulation, PySpark execution, and reconciliation reporting. Both address error handling, logging, and automation. Minor differences exist in the level of environment abstraction and external system integration, but the core intent and logic are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,1-240;1-177,"The overall flow is nearly identical: configuration, ABAP code parsing/execution, data export to Parquet, transfer to storage, PySpark loading and transformation, comparison, and reporting. '1.0 1' uses an OOP class-based approach with methods for each phase and includes an embedded pytest suite (lines 144-240), while '2.0 1' is more functional/procedural and includes explicit configuration/environment abstraction at the top. Both provide modular, auditable steps, but differ in code organization and level of external dependency simulation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,98,"17-240","Minor issues: some unused imports (e.g., 'traceback'), minor comments not matching code (e.g., 'for simulation, we assume a single table'), and a few error messages could be clearer. All core logic is syntactically valid, no broken references. Embedded pytest section is syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,96,"7-177","A few minor syntax-level issues: some functions (e.g., 'transfer_to_storage') rename files without checking destination existence, potentially causing errors. The logging setup is robust but could miss logs if LOG_FILE path is unwritable. Some comments reference unimplemented features (e.g., HDFS), but do not impact script execution. No syntax errors or undefined variables detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of '1.0 1' (98) and '2.0 1' (96)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,"17-240","Remove unused imports (e.g., 'traceback') and clarify comments for simulation assumptions. Consider externalizing configuration as in '2.0 1'."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"7-177","Add destination existence checks before renaming files in 'transfer_to_storage'. Ensure logging path is always writable. Remove or implement references to unimplemented features (e.g., HDFS CLI)."
