Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both '1.0 1' and '2.0 1' outputs robustly implement an ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation framework, with high semantic and structural alignment. Minor structural and documentation differences exist, but both scripts fulfill the core intent and cover all required validation steps. Syntax is nearly perfect in both, with only superficial Pythonic or comment style differences. Overall, both outputs are highly professional and production-ready."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts implement a comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation framework, covering parsing, simulation, transformation, and reconciliation. Minor differences exist: '1.0 1' provides a slightly more detailed test harness, while '2.0 1' has more explicit configuration and logging. However, all core processes and validation intent are fully aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-185 (1.0 1), 1-166 (2.0 1)","Both outputs follow a similar structure (initialization, parsing, simulation, conversion, transfer, transformation, comparison, reporting, error handling). '2.0 1' uses more modular utility functions and explicit config, while '1.0 1' inlines some logic. '1.0 1' includes an extensive pytest suite at the end (lines 186+), which is not present in '2.0 1', but otherwise the flow is closely matched."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"All Python and PySpark code is syntactically correct, with no undefined variables or broken references. Extensive docstrings and comments are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,98,"60-65","Minor issue: in '2.0 1', if the PySpark code does not define 'renamed_df', the error handling fallback creates an empty DataFrame with a generic schema (lines 60-65). Otherwise, syntax is valid and robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of (100) and (98). Both outputs are internally consistent and nearly error-free."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"60-65","Consider improving error handling for missing 'renamed_df' in PySpark code execution. Instead of silently creating an empty DataFrame, raise a clear exception or require the output variable to be present."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,,"For parity with '1.0 1', consider adding a pytest or unit test suite to directly validate transformation logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,,"Consider adopting a more modular config/logging approach as in '2.0 1', making the script more production-deployment ready."
