Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' and '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' provide comprehensive, automated scripts for ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, with robust error handling and reconciliation reporting. Semantic intent and outcomes are nearly identical. Minor structural differences exist in configuration and modularization style, but both scripts are functionally equivalent. Syntax correctness is perfect for both, with no errors detected. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts automate validation of ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including simulation or real execution, data export, distributed storage transfer, PySpark processing, and reconciliation reporting. Both include error handling, logging, and auditability. Differences are limited to style and naming. Both scripts achieve the same business objective and intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-100 (1.0 1), 1-120 (2.0 1)","Overall structure is highly similar: both scripts initialize environments, parse/extract input, simulate or connect to ABAP, perform CSV/Parquet conversion, transfer to storage, load via PySpark, execute transformation, compare results, and generate a JSON report. '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' uses more modular utility functions and explicit config sections, while '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' uses a class-based approach. Minor differences in error handling locations and test case embedding (pytest script included in 1.0 1)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"Script passes Python syntax, all imports are valid, and no undefined variables or broken references detected. Pytest script is well-formed and covers key scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,100,,"Script passes Python syntax, all imports and error handling are valid. No undefined variables or syntax errors. All configuration and logging blocks are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of both outputs (100/100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,,"1-120","Consider including explicit pytest or unit test cases (as in '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' lines 101-180) for transformation logic validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,,"1-100","Consider modularizing configuration and utility functions for clarity, as demonstrated in '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt'."
