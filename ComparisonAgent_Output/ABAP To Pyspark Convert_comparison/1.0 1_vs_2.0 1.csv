Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt deliver comprehensive, automated validation scripts for ABAP to PySpark migration. Semantic and structural alignment is very high, with minor differences in error handling, configuration abstraction, and test coverage. Both scripts generate reconciliation reports, support robust logging, and address auditability. 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes more explicit pytest-based test coverage, while 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt abstracts configuration and supports SAP RFC and storage plugins more generically. Syntax correctness is high in both; 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt has a minor potential issue with os.rename usage for file moves (see line 119). Overall, both are enterprise-grade, with 1.0 1 slightly more test-focused and 2.0 1 more configurable."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts automate validation of ABAP to PySpark migration, including simulated or real ABAP execution, PySpark transformation, result comparison, and reconciliation report generation. Both check row/column/schema matches and provide detailed logging. Minor semantic divergence: 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt emphasizes explicit test case coverage (lines 202-307), while 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt abstracts more for production environments and multi-storage (lines 38-115)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-200,38-200","Overall structure is nearly identical: (1) ABAP parse/execute, (2) PySpark load/transform, (3) compare, (4) report, (5) error/log handling. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt moves some configuration and storage handling into utility functions (lines 38-115), and supports more flexible input. 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes a full pytest suite (lines 202-307), which is not present in 2.0 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, function/class definitions, and test cases are well-formed (lines 1-307)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,97,"119","Minor portability risk: os.rename (line 119) may fail if moving files across filesystems; os.replace or shutil.move is safer. Otherwise, code is syntactically valid, with robust error handling and logging."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,202-307,"Consider porting the explicit pytest-based test suite from 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (lines 202-307) to 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt for enhanced test coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,119,"Replace os.rename with shutil.move or os.replace in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (line 119) to improve cross-platform reliability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,38-115,"If only local storage is needed, simplify configuration utility section in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (lines 38-115). Otherwise, document environment variable requirements more clearly."
