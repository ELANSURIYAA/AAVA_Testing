Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs implement a robust ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation script, addressing the same functional and audit requirements. Semantic alignment is very high, with only minor differences in naming and simulated/real connectivity. Structural similarity is strong, with similar stepwise orchestration, but 2.0 1 uses more configuration blocks and more explicit environment handling. Syntax correctness is perfect for both scripts (100/100), with no undefined variables, import errors, or broken blocks. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,"1-146 (1.0 1), 1-140 (2.0 1)","Both scripts automate the validation of ABAP-to-PySpark migration, parsing ABAP code, simulating or executing transformations, exporting to Parquet, transferring to distributed storage, loading via PySpark, comparing outputs, and generating reconciliation reports. 2.0 1 provides more explicit config/environment handling and attempts real SAP RFC connection, while 1.0 1 focuses on simulation. These differences are minor and do not affect the core intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,93,"1-146 (1.0 1), 1-140 (2.0 1)","Each script follows a stepwise orchestration: parse ABAP, simulate/execute ABAP, convert/export, transfer to storage, load via PySpark, run transformation, compare results, generate report. 2.0 1 is slightly more modular, with explicit utility/config blocks and more parameterization, while 1.0 1 uses a class-based approach. Both include error handling and logging, but 2.0 1 has more distributed config and block separation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,"1-146","No syntax errors detected. All imports are valid. All classes, methods, and functions are defined and used correctly. Logging, error handling, and main orchestration are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,100,"1-140","No syntax errors detected. All imports are valid. All functions and main block are defined and used correctly. Logging, error handling, and configuration are internally consistent. No broken references."
