Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs achieve very high semantic similarity (97/100), with minor differences in configuration handling and error reporting. Structural similarity is strong (93/100), with 1.0 1 using a class and pytest suite while 2.0 1 is procedural and more environment-config-driven. Syntax correctness is perfect for 1.0 1 (100/100) and nearly perfect for 2.0 1 (99/100; minor portability issue at line 211). Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both outputs automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, simulate ABAP output, perform PySpark transformation, export to Parquet, transfer to storage, and compare results. Both generate reconciliation reports with row/column and match percentage. Minor divergence in naming, error handling, and reporting format."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,93,"18-210 (1.0 1), 25-210 (2.0 1)","Both scripts use modular helpers and main orchestration. 1.0 1 uses a class-based approach and includes a pytest suite (lines 211-290). 2.0 1 uses procedural functions and abstracts configuration (lines 22-32, 35-60). Flow and decomposition are aligned, but approach differs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"Python syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors detected. All imports, class definitions, and test cases are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,99,"211","Python syntax is valid; minor issue at line 211: os.rename may fail across filesystems, should use shutil.move for portability. Otherwise, no undefined variables or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of 1.0 1 (100) and 2.0 1 (99)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,,"211","Use shutil.move instead of os.rename for file transfer robustness across filesystems."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,,"22-32","Consider abstracting configuration (paths, filenames) to environment variables for production parity."
