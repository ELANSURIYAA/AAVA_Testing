Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,98,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs implement robust, automated validation scripts for ABAP-to-PySpark migration. They cover parsing, execution simulation, storage transfer, PySpark transformation, and reconciliation. 2.0 1 provides more explicit configuration and storage options, while 1.0 1 is slightly more concise. Both scripts include error handling and reporting. Semantic and structural similarity are very high. Syntax is correct in both, with minor differences in logging and config usage. Overall score: 98/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,"1-218 (1.0 1), 1-188 (2.0 1)","Both outputs address the same migration validation goal, including parsing, execution simulation, transformation, reconciliation, and error handling. 2.0 1 provides more explicit configuration and environment variable support, while 1.0 1 is slightly more direct in its workflow. No substantive divergence in intent or outcome."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,97,"1-218 (1.0 1), 1-188 (2.0 1)","Both scripts follow similar logical flow: initialization, ABAP parsing/execution, CSV to Parquet conversion, storage transfer, Spark transformation, comparison, and report generation. 2.0 1 uses more modular utility functions and explicit config, while 1.0 1 uses a class-based approach. Minor difference in how storage and logging are handled structurally."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"1.0 1 script is syntactically correct. No undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors detected. All imports are valid, and function/class definitions are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,99,"22,85,130,144","2.0 1 script is syntactically correct overall, but minor issues: logger is set up to both file and print, which can cause duplicate logs (line 22). os.rename in transfer_to_storage (line 85) can fail if source and destination are on different filesystems; recommend using shutil.copy2 for robustness. Several comments reference not implemented features (lines 130, 144), but do not affect script execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 1.0 1 (100) and 2.0 1 (99) rounded up due to non-critical issues."
