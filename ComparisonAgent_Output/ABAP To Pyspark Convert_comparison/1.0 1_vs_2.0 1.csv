Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,93,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs deliver comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation scripts, with strong semantic and structural alignment. Both scripts automate migration validation, simulate or connect to ABAP, handle distributed storage, and output reconciliation reports. 1.0 1 includes integrated pytest cases for transformation logic; 2.0 1 features more explicit configuration, environment variable usage, and slightly broader error handling. Minor differences in structure and modularization, but both are highly correct and robust. Overall score: 93/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"1-230 (1.0 1), 1-184 (2.0 1)","Both scripts have the same intent: automate, validate, and reconcile ABAP-to-PySpark migrations. Both extract/parse ABAP and PySpark code, simulate execution or connect to SAP, transfer/export to distributed storage, load via Spark, transform, compare, and report. Both cover error handling, logging, and report generation. 1.0 1 includes explicit inline test cases; 2.0 1 focuses more on config/environment management. Semantic intent and outcome are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"1-230 (1.0 1), 1-184 (2.0 1)","Both decompose the migration validation workflow into similar phases: input parsing, ABAP execution (simulated/real), CSV/Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, Spark loading, transformation, comparison, and report generation. 1.0 1 encapsulates logic in a class and has a separate pytest script inline; 2.0 1 uses a more procedural style, explicit config section, and function-based utilities. 1.0 1's inclusion of test cases is a structural addition absent in 2.0 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,"1-230","1.0 1 output is syntactically correct Python, with valid imports, class/method structure, and integrated pytest script (lines 134-230). No undefined variables, broken references, or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,97,"1-184","2.0 1 output is also syntactically correct Python, with valid imports, function definitions, and error handling. Minor issues: use of os.rename (line 76) may fail if source/destination are on different filesystems; some error handling/logging could be more granular. No fatal syntax errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"134-230 (1.0 1)","Consider extracting the pytest test suite to a separate file/module for maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"76 (2.0 1)","Replace os.rename with shutil.move or explicit copy+remove for cross-filesystem compatibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"General","Consider harmonizing structural style (class vs. procedural) for easier maintenance if integrating both approaches."
