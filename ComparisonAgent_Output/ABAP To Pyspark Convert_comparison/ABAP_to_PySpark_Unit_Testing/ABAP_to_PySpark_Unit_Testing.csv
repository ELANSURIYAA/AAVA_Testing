Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,45,,"The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 are test case suites for PySpark data processing, but they address fundamentally different business logic and transformation targets. AAVA_1.0 tests a transformation/aggregation scenario for a DataFrame column 'value' with status assignment and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 tests robust CSV ingestion and error handling for SAP BW financial data import. Semantic and structural similarity are both low due to different business domains and logic. Both scripts are syntactically correct, so correctness is perfect. Overall score: 45/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,35,"1-66 (AAVA_1.0), 1-140 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 is focused on status assignment and aggregation for a DataFrame column 'value' and its scenarios (happy path, empty, nulls, boundary, type error). AAVA_2.0 is focused on CSV row integrity, error handling, file existence, and data field integrity for financial import. The business intent and data models are different, so semantic overlap is minimal (only both being PySpark test suites)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,40,"1-66 (AAVA_1.0), 1-140 (AAVA_2.0)","Both use pytest and Spark session fixtures, and structure test cases as functions. However, the test case decomposition, helper function design, and tested transformations differ greatly: AAVA_1.0 tests DataFrame column logic and aggregation, AAVA_2.0 tests file IO, error handling, and schema mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"All Python syntax, pytest structure, and Spark code are valid. No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected (lines 1-66)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"All Python syntax, pytest structure, Spark code, and helper functions are valid. No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected (lines 1-140)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"1-66, 1-140","If functional alignment is desired, clarify requirements so both agents produce test suites for the same business logic. If coverage of both ingestion and transformation is needed, consider integrating both test styles in a unified suite."
