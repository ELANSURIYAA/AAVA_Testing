Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not resolved with actual content. Framework established for ABAP to PySpark unit testing comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Expected analysis would compare ABAP-to-PySpark conversion logic, unit test structure, and testing approach alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Expected analysis would compare code organization, test case structure, and conversion methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Expected validation would check ABAP syntax, PySpark syntax, and unit test framework compliance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Expected validation would check PySpark syntax, test assertions, and framework integration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure ABAP code samples include relevant business logic. 3. Verify PySpark conversion maintains functional equivalence. 4. Include comprehensive unit test coverage for both source and target implementations. 5. Validate data type mappings between ABAP and PySpark. 6. Consider performance implications of the conversion approach."
