Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs are well-structured pytest-based PySpark test suites but address fundamentally different testing scenarios. pytest_pyspark_tests.py focuses on data transformation logic with status assignment and aggregation testing (5 test cases), while the second agent provides comprehensive CSV file loading and error handling tests for SAP BW integration (10 test cases). While both demonstrate excellent pytest and PySpark practices, they serve different business purposes with minimal semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","The outputs address different core functionalities: Agent 1 tests data transformation with conditional logic (value > 1000 → High/Normal status) and aggregation, while Agent 2 tests CSV file loading, validation, and JDBC operations for SAP BW. Both are PySpark testing but for entirely different business logic. The only semantic overlap is the use of PySpark DataFrames and pytest framework. Different domains (data transformation vs ETL file processing) result in low semantic similarity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 10-20, 45-60, 80-95","Both outputs follow excellent pytest structural patterns: fixture-based SparkSession management, helper functions, comprehensive test coverage with edge cases, and proper test isolation. Agent 1 uses @pytest.fixture(scope='function') while Agent 2 uses scope='module'. Both implement similar test organization with descriptive test names, setup/teardown, assertions, and error handling tests. The main structural difference is Agent 2's additional mock framework usage and temporary file handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,pytest_pyspark_tests.py,95,"Lines 25, 67, 89","Excellent syntax validity with proper PySpark imports, correct DataFrame operations, and valid pytest structure. Minor consideration: Line 25 uses sum_ alias which is correct but could be clearer. Line 67 has proper null handling in assertions. Line 89 correctly uses pytest.raises for exception testing. All variable references are properly defined and DataFrame operations follow PySpark best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,"Lines 35-40, 78, 95-100","Strong syntax validity with proper imports and PySpark usage. Lines 35-40 show correct temporary file handling with proper cleanup. Line 78 has a logical issue in the filter condition that may not work as intended for column count validation. Lines 95-100 demonstrate proper exception handling and mocking. The JDBC mock implementation is well-structured and follows testing best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper PySpark and pytest usage. Agent 1 has slightly better internal consistency, while Agent 2 has more complex but generally well-implemented file handling and mocking logic."

Recommendations,Recommendation,pytest_pyspark_tests.py,,"Lines 25, 45-50","Consider using more descriptive alias for sum_ import (line 25). Add more comprehensive error handling tests similar to Agent 2's approach. Consider adding file I/O testing scenarios to complement the current transformation-focused tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 78, 85-90","Fix the column count validation logic in line 78 - the current filter condition may not correctly identify rows with wrong column counts. Consider adding more data transformation tests beyond just file loading. Add boundary condition tests for numeric validations similar to Agent 1's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both test suites excel in their respective domains. Consider cross-pollination: Agent 1 could benefit from Agent 2's comprehensive error handling and file I/O patterns, while Agent 2 could incorporate Agent 1's data transformation testing approaches. Both demonstrate excellent pytest practices that could be standardized across the organization."
