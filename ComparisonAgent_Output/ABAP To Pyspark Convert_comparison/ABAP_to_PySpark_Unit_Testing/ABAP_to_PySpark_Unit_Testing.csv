Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No concrete content was available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation. To complete this analysis, please provide the actual agent outputs that need to be compared."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables were provided instead of concrete content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables were provided instead of concrete content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Placeholder variable {{agent 1_string_true}} was provided instead of concrete content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Placeholder variable {{agent 2_string_true}} was provided instead of concrete content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure both outputs are related to ABAP to PySpark conversion and unit testing as indicated by the file naming. 3. Include complete code, documentation, or test cases for comprehensive evaluation. 4. Rerun the comparison once actual content is available."
