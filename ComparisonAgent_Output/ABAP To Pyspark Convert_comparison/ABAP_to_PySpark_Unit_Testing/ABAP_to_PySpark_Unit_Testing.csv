Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis - Agent outputs not provided in readable format. Input contains placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content. To complete this analysis, please provide the actual agent outputs for ABAP to PySpark unit testing conversion."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without access to Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without access to Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure outputs contain ABAP to PySpark unit testing conversion code or documentation. 3. Include line numbers in outputs for precise reference during evaluation. 4. Specify the exact nature of the conversion task (code translation, test case generation, documentation, etc.) for targeted analysis."
