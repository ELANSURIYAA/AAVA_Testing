Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the provided inputs contain template placeholders ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No meaningful semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation can be conducted without the actual content to analyze."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template placeholders were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template placeholders were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Template placeholder {{agent 1_string_true}} was provided instead."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Template placeholder {{agent 2_string_true}} was provided instead."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template placeholders for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain complete, executable content for proper evaluation. 3. Verify that input preprocessing correctly substitutes template variables with real content before analysis."
