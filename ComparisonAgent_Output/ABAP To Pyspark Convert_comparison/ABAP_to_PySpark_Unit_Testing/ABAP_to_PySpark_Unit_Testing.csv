Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"2. Ensure agent outputs are properly formatted and contain the expected content type (code, documentation, test cases, etc.)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"3. Verify input processing pipeline to prevent placeholder text from reaching the comparison agent."
