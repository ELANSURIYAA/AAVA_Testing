Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,61,,"AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs are both comprehensive PySpark unit test suites, but they serve different domains and scenarios. AAVA_1.0 focuses on transformation and aggregation logic for a DataFrame with value/status logic, while AAVA_2.0 targets robust CSV file ingestion and error handling for SAP BW table loading. Semantic overlap exists only in generic testing principles, not in business logic. Structural approaches are both methodical and pytest-driven, but test decomposition and coverage differ. Syntax and test structure are correct in both files, with minor improvement opportunities in documentation clarity. Overall score: 61/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,55,"1-60 (AAVA_1.0), 1-136 (AAVA_2.0)","Intent partially overlaps: both outputs provide PySpark pytest suites for business logic, but AAVA_1.0 tests value/status transformation and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 covers file parsing, error handling, and data loading. No direct mapping between test cases."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"1-60 (AAVA_1.0), 1-136 (AAVA_2.0)","Both use pytest with Spark fixtures, helper functions, and case-by-case test methods. However, AAVA_1.0 tests transformation/aggregation logic on DataFrames, while AAVA_2.0 centers on CSV parsing, error handling, and JDBC mocks. Decomposition is similar, but the subject matter and coverage differ."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"AAVA_1.0 syntax is correct: all pytest functions, Spark setup/teardown, and transformation logic are well-formed. No broken references or undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"AAVA_2.0 syntax is correct: all pytest functions, Spark session management, helper functions, and mocks are syntactically valid. No errors in test or helper logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of AAVA_1.0 (100) and AAVA_2.0 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-60 (AAVA_1.0), 1-136 (AAVA_2.0)","Consider aligning test case domains if business goals overlap. Add cross-referenced documentation explaining the distinct logic tested in each suite."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-136 (AAVA_2.0)","Improve inline documentation for helper functions and clarify expected outcomes for each error-handling scenario."
