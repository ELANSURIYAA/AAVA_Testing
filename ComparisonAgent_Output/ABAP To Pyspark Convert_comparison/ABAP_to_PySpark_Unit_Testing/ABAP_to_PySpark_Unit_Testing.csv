Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis - agent outputs not provided in input. Received placeholder text {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual agent outputs. Analysis requires actual content to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing meanings, intent, and purpose of both outputs to determine alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent output evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison analysis. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain complete ABAP to PySpark conversion code or documentation. 3. Include unit testing components for comprehensive evaluation. 4. Verify outputs are properly formatted and syntactically valid before submission."
