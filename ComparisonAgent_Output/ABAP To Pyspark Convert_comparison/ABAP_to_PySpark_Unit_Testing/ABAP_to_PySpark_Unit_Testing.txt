# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. To complete the systematic comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions, the actual content from both agents is required.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of both outputs to determine if they address the same inferred goal and apply similar transformations or reasoning.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires examining the logical structure, flow, decomposition approach, order of steps, and use of logical blocks to determine alignment between outputs.

### Correctness

**Agent_1:** Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Correctness evaluation requires checking syntax validity, undefined variables, broken references, and internal consistency.

**Agent_2:** Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Correctness evaluation requires checking syntax validity, undefined variables, broken references, and internal consistency.

**Overall:** Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

To proceed with automated agent output comparison:

1. **Provide actual agent outputs** instead of placeholder variables
2. **Ensure outputs contain identifiable content** for semantic analysis  
3. **Include proper formatting** for structural evaluation
4. **Verify syntax completeness** for correctness assessment

Once actual outputs are provided, systematic comparison can be performed across all three dimensions with detailed scoring and line-by-line analysis.
