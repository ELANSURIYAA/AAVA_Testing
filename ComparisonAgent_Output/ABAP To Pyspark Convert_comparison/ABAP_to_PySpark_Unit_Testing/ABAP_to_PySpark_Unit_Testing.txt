# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 95/100
- Both agent outputs exhibit strong semantic similarity, addressing the same objectives with well-aligned intent and reasoning. Minor differences exist in terminology and emphasis.
- Structural similarity is high, with both outputs following similar logical flows and decomposition. There are minor divergences in section ordering (Agent_1 lines 5-8 vs Agent_2 lines 6-9).
- Syntax-level correctness is perfect for both agents, with no detected errors or inconsistencies.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 94/100)

- Both outputs focus on the same goal, providing systematic comparison and validation of agent outputs.
- The explanations and reasoning are closely aligned, with only minor differences in terminology and presentation.
- Key content overlap is observed in Agent_1 lines 3-10 and Agent_2 lines 2-9.
- Differences are superficial and do not affect overall meaning.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- The logical breakdown and flow are nearly identical.
- Both outputs use similar decompositions, but Agent_2 presents validation steps before scoring, while Agent_1 integrates them.
- Divergence in section ordering noted at Agent_1 lines 5-8 and Agent_2 lines 6-9.

### Correctness

**Agent_1: 100/100**

- No syntax errors or structural issues detected.
- All references and formatting are internally consistent.

**Agent_2: 100/100**

- No syntax errors or structural issues detected.
- All references and formatting are internally consistent.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect               | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity  | 94      | 94      | 94      |
| Structural Similarity| 92      | 92      | 92      |
| Correctness          | 100     | 100     | 100     |
| **Overall**          | -       | -       | **95**  |

## Recommendations

- **Agent_2 (lines 6-9):** Align section order with Agent_1 to improve structural consistency.
- **Agent_1 (lines 5-8):** Clarify terminology to match Agent_2 for improved semantic clarity.
