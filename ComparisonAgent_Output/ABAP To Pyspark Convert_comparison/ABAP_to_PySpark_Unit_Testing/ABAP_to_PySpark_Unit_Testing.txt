Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,59,,"The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 represent distinct testing strategies for PySpark code, with different business logic and objectives. Semantic similarity is low (59/100) due to divergent goals: AAVA_1.0 tests status assignment and aggregation logic, while AAVA_2.0 tests CSV ingestion, schema validation, error handling, and JDBC operations. Structural similarity is moderate (61/100), with both outputs providing structured test cases and Pytest scripts, but differing in decomposition and focus. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100). Overall score: 73/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,59,"1-41 (AAVA_1.0), 1-109 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 focuses on data transformation (status assignment and aggregation) in PySpark, while AAVA_2.0 centers on CSV ingestion, schema validation, error handling, and JDBC integration. There is minimal overlap in business logic, with only superficial similarity in test case structure."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,61,"1-41 (AAVA_1.0), 1-109 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs use Pytest and structured test cases, but AAVA_1.0 organizes tests around PySpark DataFrame transformations and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 structures tests around file operations, schema validation, and error handling. The decomposition and logical flow differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"AAVA_1.0 script is syntactically correct: proper PySpark, pytest usage, valid Python syntax, fixture management, and all functions and references resolve."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"AAVA_2.0 script is syntactically correct: valid Python, Pytest, SparkSession setup, correct mocking, helper functions, and no broken references. All test cases are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of AAVA_1.0 (100) and AAVA_2.0 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"1-41 (AAVA_1.0), 1-109 (AAVA_2.0)","If the intent is to test similar business logic, align the test case goals and underlying PySpark transformation logic between both outputs. Otherwise, clarify requirements for semantic overlap."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,,"Both outputs are structurally and syntactically sound. No immediate changes needed for syntax, but consider convergence in testing focus if business requirements dictate."
