# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 94/100
- Both agent outputs demonstrate high semantic and structural similarity, effectively addressing the same objective with only minor differences in explanatory detail and section ordering.
- Syntax correctness is perfect for both outputs (100/100).
- Main differences: Agent_B omits an example block present in Agent_A (lines 7-11), and there is a slight divergence in section ordering (lines 14-17).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 93/100)

- Both outputs address the same core objective and intent.
- Minor divergence in explanatory detail: Agent_A provides additional context in lines 3-5, while Agent_B omits this but otherwise reaches the same conclusion.
- The omitted details do not impact the overall meaning or transformation.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- The overall flow is similar, with logical decomposition maintained in both outputs.
- Agent_B omits the example block present in Agent_A (lines 7-11), resulting in a minor structural divergence.
- Section ordering differs slightly in lines 14-17, but this does not impact the logical progression.

### Correctness

**Agent_A: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**Agent_B: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

- Both outputs are syntactically correct and internally consistent.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | Agent_A | Agent_B | Overall |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 93      | 93      | 93      |
| Structural Similarity | 92      | 92      | 92      |
| Correctness           | 100     | 100     | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -       | -       | **94**  |

## Recommendations

- **Agent_B (lines 7-11):** Add the missing example block from Agent_A for completeness.
- **Both (lines 14-17):** Consider aligning section ordering for improved readability.
