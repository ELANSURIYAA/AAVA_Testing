# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 75/100
- **Summary:** Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 provide PySpark test automation suites using pytest, but their business logic and validation targets differ significantly. AAVA_1.0 validates GL data transformation and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 focuses on CSV file ingestion and error handling for finance data. Semantic similarity is moderate (67/100) due to overlapping ETL/data pipeline testing intent but divergent domains. Structural similarity is lower (58/100), reflecting different test decomposition and helper architecture. Syntax correctness is perfect for both agents (100/100 each).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 67/100)

- **Analysis:** Both outputs implement PySpark test suites with pytest, focusing on data pipeline validation. However, AAVA_1.0 centers on GL data transformation (assigning status, aggregating values), whereas AAVA_2.0 addresses CSV file ingestion, schema validation, and error handling (malformed files, JDBC failures).
- **Key Observations:** The intent overlaps at a high level (testing data processing), but the business logic, expected outcomes, and data domains are notably different.
- **Line References:** AAVA_1.0: lines 1-54; AAVA_2.0: lines 1-135

### Structural Similarity (Score: 58/100)

- **Analysis:** 
    - AAVA_1.0 organizes test cases around transformation scenarios: happy path, empty DataFrame, null values, boundary conditions, and invalid data types.
    - AAVA_2.0 structures tests by file input variations: empty files, malformed rows, error handling, type checks, and mocks JDBC writes.
    - Both use pytest fixtures and test functions, but the overall decomposition (test case types, helper functions, error mocking) is divergent.
- **Line References:** AAVA_1.0: lines 1-54; AAVA_2.0: lines 1-135

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0 : 100/100**

- Syntax is fully valid across all pytest functions, fixtures, and PySpark code.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors.
- **Line References:** 1-54

**AAVA_2.0 : 100/100**

- All pytest syntax, SparkSession fixture, helper functions, and test logic are syntactically correct.
- No broken references, invalid imports, or syntax errors.
- **Line References:** 1-135

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect               | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |
|----------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity  | 67       | 67       | 67      |
| Structural Similarity| 58       | 58       | 58      |
| Correctness          | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**          | -        | -        | **75**  |

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0 (lines 1-54):** Consider expanding test coverage to include file ingestion and error handling scenarios for greater robustness, similar to AAVA_2.0.
- **AAVA_2.0 (lines 1-135):** Add business logic transformation validation (e.g., status assignment, aggregation) to more closely match the focus of AAVA_1.0.
