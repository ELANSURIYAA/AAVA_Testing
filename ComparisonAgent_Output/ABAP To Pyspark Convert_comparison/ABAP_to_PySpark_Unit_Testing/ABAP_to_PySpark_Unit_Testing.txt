## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 94/100
- Both agent1_string_true and agent2_string_true outputs address the same goal with high semantic similarity (92/100).
- Structural similarity is strong (90/100), with minor differences in decomposition: agent2_string_true provides more explicit step-wise breakdown, while agent1_string_true is more concise.
- Syntax correctness is perfect for both outputs (100/100).
- No syntax or formatting errors detected in either output.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- Both outputs achieve the intended objective and align in overall meaning.
- agent2_string_true includes more detailed step-wise explanations (lines 4-9), while agent1_string_true is more succinct.
- Minor differences in reasoning detail, but both reach the same conclusions.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 90/100)

- Logical flow is similar, but agent2_string_true breaks down the process into explicit steps (lines 4-9).
- agent1_string_true summarizes these steps in fewer sections.
- Structure is strongly aligned but not identical.
