Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,64,,"The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 represent PySpark-based unit test suites but target different business logic and validation objectives. Semantic similarity is moderate (60/100) as the test intent and functional focus differ. Structural similarity is also moderate (65/100), with both using pytest and Spark fixtures but diverging in logical decomposition and tested scenarios. Syntax correctness is perfect for both agents (100/100), with no errors detected in either script. Overall score: 64/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,60,"AAVA_1.0:1-90;AAVA_2.0:1-133","AAVA_1.0 tests a PySpark transformation and aggregation for GL data, focusing on status assignment and value summation. AAVA_2.0 tests CSV ingestion and error handling for SAP BW loading logic. While both use Spark and pytest for data-centric validation, their core business logic, test coverage, and outcome expectations differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"AAVA_1.0:1-90;AAVA_2.0:1-133","Both use pytest and Spark session fixtures, modular helper functions, and methodical test case blocks. However, AAVA_1.0 organizes tests around transformation/aggregation scenarios, while AAVA_2.0 is structured around file ingestion and error handling. Test case enumeration and flow differ (AAVA_1.0: transformation-centric; AAVA_2.0: ingestion-centric)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"AAVA_1.0 script is syntactically correct throughout (lines 1-90). All pytest, Spark, and Python constructs are valid; no undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"AAVA_2.0 script is syntactically correct throughout (lines 1-133). All pytest, Spark, Python, and helper constructs are valid; no undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_1.0,,"","Consider aligning business logic coverage with ingestion/validation scenarios as in AAVA_2.0 for broader test coverage and cross-agent semantic alignment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_2.0,,"","Consider including transformation and aggregation logic testing, similar to AAVA_1.0, for increased semantic and structural similarity and to ensure coverage of data manipulation operations."
