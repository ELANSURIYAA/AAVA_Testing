# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 60/100
- **Key Findings:**  
  The outputs for `AAVA_1.0` and `AAVA_2.0` are both PySpark-related test suites but target fundamentally different business logic and transformation scenarios. Semantic similarity is low (50/100) due to divergent goals and data domains. Structural similarity is moderate (60/100) as both follow Pytest conventions and have multiple test cases, but the test decomposition, helper functions, and scenario coverage differ. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100), with no syntax errors or broken references detected.
- **Major Differences:**  
  - `AAVA_1.0` focuses on DataFrame column transformation and aggregation logic.
  - `AAVA_2.0` targets CSV ingestion, row validation, error handling, and data loading for a more complex schema.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 50/100)

- **Intent and Meaning Alignment:**  
  - `AAVA_1.0` is designed to test the transformation of a DataFrame by assigning status values based on numeric thresholds and aggregating totals.
  - `AAVA_2.0` is designed to test the ingestion of CSV data, ensuring row validity, error handling, and proper loading into a target system.
  - The core business logic, data structure, and transformation goals are quite different.
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Both use PySpark and Pytest, but test completely different functionalities.
  - There is minimal overlap in the purpose of the test cases.
- **Line References:**  
  - `AAVA_1.0`: lines 1-86
  - `AAVA_2.0`: lines 1-161

### Structural Similarity (Score: 60/100)

- **Structural and Flow Alignment:**  
  - Both outputs use Pytest fixtures for Spark session setup.
  - Both enumerate multiple test cases.
  - `AAVA_2.0` introduces file helpers, a mock JDBC writer, and more granular error handling and validation scenarios.
  - `AAVA_1.0` focuses solely on DataFrame transformation and aggregation.
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Decomposition and helper structure differ significantly.
  - Test coverage in `AAVA_2.0` is broader, addressing I/O and error conditions.
- **Line References:**  
  - `AAVA_1.0`: lines 1-86
  - `AAVA_2.0`: lines 1-161

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**

- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references.
- All imports, function definitions, and test case logic are well-formed.
- **Line References:** lines 1-86

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**

- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references.
- Imports, fixtures, helpers, and test cases are all syntactically valid.
- **Line References:** lines 1-161

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

- Both agents are fully syntactically correct.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect               | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |

| Semantic Similarity  | 50       | 50       | 50      |
| Structural Similarity| 60       | 60       | 60      |
| Correctness          | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**          | -        | -        | **60**  |

## Recommendations

- **For AAVA_1.0:**  
  Consider aligning test scenarios or data flow with the more robust ingestion/validation pipeline of `AAVA_2.0` if business domains overlap.

- **For AAVA_2.0:**  
  Clarify business rules and add transformation/aggregation logic tests if such logic is relevant for the target use case.
