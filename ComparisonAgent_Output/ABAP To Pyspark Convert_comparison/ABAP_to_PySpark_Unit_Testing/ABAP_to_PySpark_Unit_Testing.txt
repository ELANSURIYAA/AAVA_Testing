# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 56/100
- **Key Findings:**  
  Outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 are both comprehensive PySpark unit test suites but target fundamentally different business logic and transformation domains. Semantic similarity is low (55/100) due to non-overlapping goals; structural similarity is moderate (60/100) as both follow standard pytest test suite organization; correctness is perfect for both outputs (100/100 each).
- **Major Differences:**  
  AAVA_1.0 tests a value/status transformation and aggregation, AAVA_2.0 tests CSV ingestion and validation logic.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 55/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  AAVA_1.0 tests transformation logic for assigning 'status' and aggregating 'value' in a DataFrame.  
  AAVA_2.0 tests CSV ingestion, schema validation, error handling, and data loading logic.  
  There is minimal overlap in intent or business logic—both are valid PySpark test suites, but their purposes do not align.
- **Line References:**  
  Entire test suite contents.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 60/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  Both outputs are organized as pytest test modules with fixtures for SparkSession, test helpers, and test cases.  
  However, AAVA_1.0 uses a function-per-case approach focused on DataFrame transformation, while AAVA_2.0 structures tests around CSV ingestion scenarios and mocks JDBC writes.  
  Test case enumeration and helper use are similar, but the logical decomposition and test focus differ.

  - AAVA_2.0: lines 12–163

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**

- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references found (lines 14–112).  
- All fixtures, test cases, and helper functions are internally consistent.

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**

- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references found (lines 12–163).  
- Test helpers, fixture usage, and test case implementations are well-formed.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0:**  
  If alignment is desired, consider refactoring test objectives to match ingestion/validation logic as in AAVA_2.0 or vice versa. Otherwise, clarify in documentation that the test suites target different functional modules.

- **AAVA_2.0:**  
  If alignment is desired, add tests for transformation/aggregation logic on loaded DataFrames as in AAVA_1.0. Otherwise, clarify scope and module coverage in comments.
