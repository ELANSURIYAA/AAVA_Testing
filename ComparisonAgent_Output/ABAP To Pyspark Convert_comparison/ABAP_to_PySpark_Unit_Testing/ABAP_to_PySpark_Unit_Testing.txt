Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,77,,"The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 both provide PySpark unit testing approaches, but for different business logic: AAVA_1.0 focuses on GL data transformation and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 centers on CSV ingestion, validation, and data loading. Semantic similarity is moderate (65/100) due to overlapping testing intent but divergent domain logic. Structural similarity is fair (70/100), as both use pytest and Spark fixtures, but have distinct test decomposition and helper usage. Syntax correctness is high for both (AAVA_1.0: 95/100, AAVA_2.0: 98/100), with minor inconsistencies in exception handling and schema definitions. Overall score: 77/100."

Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"1-52 (AAVA_1.0), 1-147 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs are PySpark unit testing suites using pytest. However, AAVA_1.0 tests GL data transformation/aggregation logic, while AAVA_2.0 tests robust CSV ingestion, row validation, and error handling. Both apply rigorous edge case testing (empty, nulls, type errors), but their business objectives and expected outcomes diverge (see lines 1-52 for AAVA_1.0 and 1-147 for AAVA_2.0)."

Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"1-52 (AAVA_1.0), 1-147 (AAVA_2.0)","Both suites use pytest, SparkSession fixtures, and split tests into discrete cases. AAVA_2.0 adds helper functions for file I/O and JDBC mocking, more granular error simulation, and tabular test documentation. AAVA_1.0 follows a simpler structure with direct test functions and transformation logic. Both use setup/teardown, but test decomposition and helper usage differ (see lines 1-52 for AAVA_1.0, lines 1-147 for AAVA_2.0)."

Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,95,"8-52","AAVA_1.0 script is syntactically correct, but some assertion messages are missing, and test_TC005_InvalidDataType's exception scope could be refined (see lines 46-52). Otherwise, Spark session management and function definitions are correct."

Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,98,"67-78, 83-147","AAVA_2.0 script is syntactically well-formed, with comprehensive helper functions and mocks. Minor improvement possible in exception handling granularity (lines 67-78) and schema definition clarity in test helpers (lines 83-147). No critical syntax errors detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-52 (AAVA_1.0)","Consider expanding AAVA_1.0's edge case coverage to match AAVA_2.0's granular error simulation and helper usage for improved robustness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"67-78, 83-147 (AAVA_2.0)","Refine exception handling and clarify schema definitions in test helpers for even stronger correctness and maintainability."
