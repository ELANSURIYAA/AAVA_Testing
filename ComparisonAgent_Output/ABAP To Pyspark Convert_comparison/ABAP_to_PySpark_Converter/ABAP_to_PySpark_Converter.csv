Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comprehensive comparison of ABAP to PySpark converter outputs analyzing semantic similarity, structural approach, and syntactic correctness. Both agents demonstrate code transformation capabilities with varying approaches to ABAP-to-PySpark conversion patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address ABAP to PySpark conversion with similar intent. Agent outputs show consistent understanding of data transformation requirements, though implementation strategies differ in complexity and optimization approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 10-30,"Structural approaches show moderate alignment. Both use similar conversion patterns for ABAP constructs, but differ in code organization and modularization strategies. Control flow handling shows consistent patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,92,Lines 5-15,"Syntactically correct PySpark code with proper imports and DataFrame operations. Minor issues with variable naming conventions and some unused imports detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,88,Lines 8-20,"Valid PySpark syntax with appropriate transformation logic. Some inconsistencies in error handling and potential null pointer exceptions in edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents demonstrates high syntactic quality with minor refinements needed."
