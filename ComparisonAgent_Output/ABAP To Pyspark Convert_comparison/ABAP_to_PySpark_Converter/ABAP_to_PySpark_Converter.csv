Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content to compare. This appears to be a template or configuration issue where the actual agent outputs need to be substituted before analysis can proceed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real ABAP to PySpark conversion code or documentation to assess intent alignment and meaning preservation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real code structures to assess logical flow and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without access to actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without access to actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain complete ABAP to PySpark conversion code or documentation. 3. Verify that both agents received the same input requirements for fair comparison. 4. Re-run the comparison once actual outputs are available."
