Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Input agent outputs were not provided in readable format. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} appear to be empty or improperly substituted. Comparison requires actual agent output content to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Both inputs appear as empty placeholder variables."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. No content available for structural analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness - no content provided for Agent 1"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness - no content provided for Agent 2"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score unavailable due to missing input content"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent outputs are properly provided as readable content rather than placeholder variables. 2. Verify input substitution process is working correctly. 3. Re-run comparison once actual ABAP to PySpark conversion outputs are available. 4. Include sample input ABAP code and expected PySpark output for validation. 5. Implement proper error handling for missing input scenarios."
