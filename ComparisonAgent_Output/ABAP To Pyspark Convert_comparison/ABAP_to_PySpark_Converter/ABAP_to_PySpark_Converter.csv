Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comprehensive comparison due to missing or improperly formatted agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables that were not substituted with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as both agent outputs appear to be empty or contain only placeholder text. No meaningful content available for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity due to absence of actual output content. No structural elements available for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"No content available for syntax validation. Agent 1 output appears to contain only placeholder variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"No content available for syntax validation. Agent 2 output appears to contain only placeholder variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Average correctness score of 0 due to absence of evaluable content from both agents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent outputs are properly provided with actual content rather than placeholder variables. 2. Verify input substitution process is working correctly. 3. Re-run comparison once valid agent outputs are available. 4. Check data pipeline for proper variable replacement."
