Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-18 vs Lines 1-85","Two PySpark scripts with different purposes and complexity levels. First output (18 lines) performs simple GL data processing from Parquet files with basic transformations. Second output (85 lines) implements comprehensive finance data loading from CSV with extensive error handling, schema validation, and ABAP program conversion patterns. Both are syntactically correct but serve different business requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,40,"Lines 1-18 vs Lines 1-85","Both outputs use PySpark for data processing but address fundamentally different business scenarios. First output focuses on GL data analysis with value-based status classification and aggregation. Second output implements finance data ETL pipeline with ABAP conversion patterns, comprehensive error handling, and database integration. Technology stack overlap exists but semantic intent differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-18 vs Lines 1-85","Both follow standard PySpark patterns: SparkSession initialization, DataFrame operations, and session termination. First output uses linear structure (read→transform→aggregate→output). Second output employs complex structure with try-catch blocks, schema definitions, data validation loops, and conditional error handling. Core PySpark workflow similarity exists but architectural complexity differs substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,100,"Lines 1-18","Syntactically correct PySpark code. All imports properly defined (lines 1-2), SparkSession correctly initialized (line 5), DataFrame operations use valid syntax (lines 11-14), aggregation properly implemented (line 17), and session properly closed (line 21). No undefined variables or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,100,"Lines 1-85","Syntactically correct and comprehensive PySpark implementation. Proper imports (lines 6-8), well-defined schema structure (lines 14-22), correct DataFrame operations throughout, proper exception handling syntax (lines 25, 52), valid JDBC write configuration (lines 45-51), and appropriate session management (line 82). No syntax errors or undefined references found."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with no errors, proper imports, valid PySpark operations, and appropriate session management."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Lines 8, 17","Consider adding error handling for file operations and data validation. Add logging framework instead of simple print statements. Include data quality checks before aggregation operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Lines 45-51, 75","Replace hardcoded JDBC credentials with secure configuration management. Implement proper logging framework instead of print statements. Consider adding data lineage tracking and monitoring capabilities for production deployment."
