Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two distinct PySpark implementations with different purposes: Agent1 focuses on simple GL data processing with status categorization, while Agent2 provides comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark conversion for finance data loading with extensive error handling and documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-20 vs 1-85","Outputs serve fundamentally different purposes. Agent1 performs basic GL data transformation and aggregation, while Agent2 implements complex ETL pipeline for finance data loading from CSV to SAP BW. Both use PySpark but address completely different business requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,35,"Lines 1-20 vs 1-85","Both follow PySpark session initialization pattern and proper session cleanup. However, Agent1 uses simple linear flow (read-transform-aggregate-print), while Agent2 implements comprehensive ETL structure with schema definition, error handling blocks, data validation, and database connectivity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,"Lines 8,13","Syntactically correct PySpark code. Minor issues: hardcoded file path '/path/to/gl_table_parquet' needs configuration, and no error handling for file operations. All imports, DataFrame operations, and session management are properly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 25,45,70","Highly robust PySpark implementation with comprehensive error handling. Minor syntax consideration: line 25 filter logic could be simplified, and JDBC connection parameters are placeholder values. Excellent schema definition, data validation, and exception handling throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong PySpark syntax knowledge with Agent2 showing superior error handling and production-ready patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Replace hardcoded file paths with configurable parameters. Add comprehensive error handling for file operations and data validation. Consider implementing logging framework instead of print statements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Replace placeholder JDBC connection parameters with actual configuration management. Consider parameterizing schema definition for reusability. Add unit tests for data validation logic. Implement proper logging framework to replace print statements."
