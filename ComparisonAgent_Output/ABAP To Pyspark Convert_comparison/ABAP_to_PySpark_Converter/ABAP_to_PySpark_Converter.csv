Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content. No semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation could be performed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no actual output provided, only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no actual output provided, only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to absence of actual agent outputs to analyze."

Overall,0,0,0
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain the expected ABAP to PySpark conversion content. 3. Re-run comparison once valid inputs are available."
