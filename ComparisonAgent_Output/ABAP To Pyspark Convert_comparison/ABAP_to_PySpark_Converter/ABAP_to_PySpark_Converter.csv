Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,54,,"Outputs diverge significantly in intent and structure. AAVA_1.0 provides a simple PySpark script for reading a Parquet file, adding a status column, and computing a total value, while AAVA_2.0 delivers a full ABAP-to-PySpark migration script for a CSV-based ETL with schema, error handling, and JDBC output. Semantic similarity is low (55/100), and structural similarity is also low (50/100) due to fundamentally different logic and flow. Both scripts are syntactically correct (100/100). Overall score: 54/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,55,,"AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 both use PySpark and process tabular financial data, but AAVA_1.0 only reads/parses a Parquet file and computes a value, while AAVA_2.0 implements a full ETL workflow including schema definition, error handling, and JDBC output. Overlap is limited to the use of Spark and basic DataFrame manipulation. Major divergence in overall meaning and business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,50,"1-18 (AAVA_1.0), 1-90 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 is a short, linear script with no error handling, schema, or output logic; it reads a file, adds a column, and aggregates. AAVA_2.0 is a modular, robust ETL with try-except blocks, schema, error handling, data validation, and JDBC output. Structures are fundamentally different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,,"AAVA_1.0 is valid PySpark code. All imports, DataFrame operations, and syntax are correct. No undefined variables or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,,"AAVA_2.0 is also valid PySpark. The script is syntactically correct, with proper error handling and DataFrame operations. The triple backticks in the file are a markdown artifact and do not affect executable code."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"1-18 (AAVA_1.0)","If AAVA_1.0 is intended to match the ABAP migration context, expand it to include schema definition, error handling, and JDBC output as in AAVA_2.0."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,"1-90 (AAVA_2.0)","If only simple data reading/aggregation is needed, AAVA_2.0 can be simplified. Otherwise, clarify comparison context to ensure alignment."
