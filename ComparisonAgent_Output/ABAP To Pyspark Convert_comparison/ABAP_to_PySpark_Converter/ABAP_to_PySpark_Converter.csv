Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not resolved with actual agent outputs. This appears to be a template or configuration issue where the actual content was not provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Both agent outputs appear to be placeholder variables rather than actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. No structural elements available for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual agent output content. Input appears to be placeholder variable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual agent output content. Input appears to be placeholder variable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to absence of actual content to evaluate."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure actual agent outputs are provided instead of placeholder variables. 2. Verify that the content substitution process is working correctly. 3. Re-run the comparison once actual ABAP to PySpark conversion outputs are available. 4. Consider providing sample inputs and expected outputs for validation."
