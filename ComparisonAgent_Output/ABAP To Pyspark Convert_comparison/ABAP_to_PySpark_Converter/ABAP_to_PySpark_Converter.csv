Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison as agent outputs were not provided in readable format. Input contained placeholder variables that were not properly substituted."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Input format contained unresolved template variables."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Input format contained unresolved template variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs in readable format for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure template variables are properly substituted before analysis. 3. Include clear output type identification (code, documentation, test cases) for targeted evaluation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"4. Verify that both agent outputs address the same task or instruction set. 5. Include line numbering or clear content structure for precise reference in scoring."
