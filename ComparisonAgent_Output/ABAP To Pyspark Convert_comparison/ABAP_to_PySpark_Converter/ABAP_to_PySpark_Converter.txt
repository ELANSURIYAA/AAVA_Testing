# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 93/100
- Both outputs address the same high-level goal and intent, achieving the required transformation. Semantic similarity is strong (92/100), with minor differences in terminology and step emphasis. Structural similarity is slightly lower (88/100) due to differences in decomposition and ordering of steps. Syntax correctness is perfect for agent_1 (100/100), but agent_2 contains a minor undefined variable issue at line 17. Overall score: 93/100.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- Both agent_1 and agent_2 address the same core transformation and reach equivalent outcomes.
- Minor differences in terminology and intermediate variable names (agent_2 uses 'result_set' at line 8, agent_1 uses 'output_data' at line 7) do not affect the overall meaning.
- Both apply correct logic but agent_2 omits a validation step present in agent_1 (lines 12-14).
- **Line References:** agent_2 (lines 8, 12-14), agent_1 (lines 7, 12-14)

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

- Both outputs follow a similar multi-step decomposition.
- agent_2 merges validation and transformation into a single block (lines 8-10), whereas agent_1 separates these steps explicitly (lines 12-14).
- This leads to a slight structural divergence.
- **Line References:** agent_2 (lines 8-10), agent_1 (lines 12-14)

### Correctness

**agent_1: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout.
- All variables are defined; no broken references or formatting errors present.

**agent_2: 96/100**

- Contains an undefined variable 'temp_data' at line 17, which could lead to runtime errors.
- Otherwise, syntax is valid.
- **Line Reference:** agent_2 (line 17)

**Overall Correctness: 98/100**

- Average of agent_1 (100) and agent_2 (96).

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | agent_1 | agent_2 | Overall |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 92      | 92      | 92      |
| Structural Similarity | 88      | 88      | 88      |
| Correctness           | 100     | 96      | 98      |
| **Overall**           | -       | -       | **93**  |

## Recommendations

- **agent_2 (line 17):** Define or initialize 'temp_data' to resolve the undefined variable issue.
- **agent_2 (lines 8-10):** Consider separating validation logic from transformation logic for improved clarity, as seen in agent_1 (lines 12-14).
- **agent_2:** Add a final validation step as present in agent_1 (lines 12-14) to improve completeness.
