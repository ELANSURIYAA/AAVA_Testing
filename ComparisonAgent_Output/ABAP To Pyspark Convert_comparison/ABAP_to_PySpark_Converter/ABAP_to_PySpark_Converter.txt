# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

The comparison analysis could not be completed successfully due to missing or improperly formatted agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) that were not substituted with actual content, preventing meaningful evaluation across all dimensions.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Unable to evaluate semantic similarity as both agent outputs appear to be empty or contain only placeholder text. No meaningful content was available for comparison of intent, purpose, or reasoning approaches.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity due to absence of actual output content. No structural elements, logical flow, or decomposition approaches were available for analysis.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Average correctness score due to absence of evaluable content

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure agent outputs are properly provided with actual content rather than placeholder variables
2. **Pipeline Check**: Verify the input substitution process is working correctly in the data pipeline
3. **Re-execution**: Re-run the comparison analysis once valid agent outputs are available
4. **Quality Assurance**: Implement checks for proper variable replacement before comparison execution
