# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- The overall score for the comparison is 96/100, indicating a high degree of alignment between the two agent outputs.
- Both outputs display strong semantic similarity, addressing the same core objective with aligned intent.
- Structural similarity is also high, with only minor divergence due to a missing section in one agent's output.
- Correctness is nearly perfect, with one agent showing a minor formatting issue.
- Major differences are limited to a missing section (lines 14-18) and a formatting error (line 22).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

- Both outputs address the same core objective and apply equivalent transformations, reaching the same conclusions.
- Minor terminology differences are present but do not impact the overall meaning.
- No conceptual differences were found.
- **Line References:** N/A

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- The overall logical flow and decomposition are nearly identical between the two outputs.
- One agent omits a section present in the other at lines 14-18, causing a minor structural divergence.
- **Line References:** 14-18

### Correctness

**Agent Alpha: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout with no undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors.
- **Line References:** N/A

**Agent Beta: 98/100**

- Minor formatting error detected at line 22.
- Otherwise, syntax is valid with no undefined variables or broken references.
- **Line References:** 22

**Overall Correctness: 99/100**

- Average of Agent Alpha (100) and Agent Beta (98).

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | Agent Alpha | Agent Beta | Overall |
|-----------------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 95         | 95         | 95      |
| Structural Similarity | 92         | 92         | 92      |
| Correctness           | 100        | 98         | 99      |
| **Overall**           | -          | -          | **96**  |

## Recommendations

- **Agent Beta:** Add the missing section identified at lines 14-18 to match the structure of Agent Alpha.
- **Agent Beta:** Fix the formatting error at line 22 for full correctness compliance.
