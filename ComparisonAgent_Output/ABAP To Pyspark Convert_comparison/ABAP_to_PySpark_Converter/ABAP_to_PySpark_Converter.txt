# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison could not be completed due to missing agent outputs.

**Issue**: The provided input contained placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) that were not properly substituted with actual agent outputs. Without the actual content from both agents, a meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions cannot be performed.

**Overall Scores**: All dimensions scored 0/100 due to lack of input data.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale**: Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The input format contained unresolved template variables that prevented access to the content that should have been compared for meaning, intent, and overall purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale**: Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Unable to analyze logical structure, flow, decomposition approach, or component hierarchy when the source content is not available.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Ensure that actual agent outputs are provided in readable format for meaningful comparison rather than template placeholders.

2. **Template Variable Substitution**: Verify that all template variables are properly substituted before initiating the comparison process.

3. **Output Type Identification**: Include clear output type identification (code, documentation, test cases) to enable targeted evaluation strategies.

4. **Task Alignment Verification**: Ensure that both agent outputs address the same task or instruction set for valid comparison.

5. **Content Structure**: Include line numbering or clear content structure to enable precise reference in scoring and detailed feedback.
