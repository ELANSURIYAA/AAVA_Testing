# AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 Metadata Comparison Report

## 1. Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS FAILURE**: The comparison analysis cannot be completed due to missing source metadata. The input contains placeholder text ("{{AAVA1_string_true}}" and "{{AAVA2_string_true}}") instead of the actual AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 JSON metadata required for analysis.

**Overall Assessment**: Unable to determine alignment, changes, or migration requirements without actual metadata content.

**Migration Readiness**: Cannot assess - blocking issue due to missing source data.

## 2. Workflow-Level Metadata Comparison

**Status**: Analysis blocked

| Comparison Area | Status | Issue |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Workflow Identifiers | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Workflow Names | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Versioning Patterns | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Agent Orchestration | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Execution Ordering | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Governance Metadata | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |
| Backward Compatibility | Cannot assess | Source metadata not provided |

## 3. Agent Inventory and Mapping

### AAVA 1.0 Agents
**Status**: Cannot enumerate - source metadata not provided

### AAVA 2.0 Agents  
**Status**: Cannot enumerate - source metadata not provided

### Agent Mapping Table
| Mapping Type | Count | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Matched | Unknown | Cannot assess without source data |
| Renamed | Unknown | Cannot assess without source data |
| Added | Unknown | Cannot assess without source data |
| Removed | Unknown | Cannot assess without source data |

## 4. Agent-Level Metadata Comparison (DETAILED)

**Status**: Analysis blocked - no agents can be identified or compared without source metadata.

### Required Analysis Per Agent:
- Identity changes: Cannot assess
- Role preservation/drift: Cannot assess
- Attribute-level comparison: Cannot assess
- Semantic drift analysis: Cannot assess

## 5. Field-Level Differences (Aggregated)

**Status**: Field-level analysis impossible without source metadata

| Change Type | Count | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Added fields | Unknown | Cannot assess |
| Removed fields | Unknown | Cannot assess |
| Renamed fields | Unknown | Cannot assess |
| Constraint changes | Unknown | Cannot assess |
| Structural relocations | Unknown | Cannot assess |

## 6. Schema & Governance Evolution

**Migration Complexity**: Cannot assess - requires actual metadata structures
**Validation Enforceability**: Cannot assess - requires constraint analysis
**Traceability Impact**: Cannot assess - requires field mapping
**Governance Evolution**: Cannot assess - requires governance metadata comparison

## 7. Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Assessment | Impact |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Execution risks | Cannot assess | Unknown |
| Tooling risks | Cannot assess | Unknown |
| Model behavior risks | Cannot assess | Unknown |
| Downstream integration risks | Cannot assess | Unknown |
| **Analysis Risk** | **CRITICAL** | **Complete analysis failure** |

## 8. Scoring Summary

| Metric | Score | Justification |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0/100 | Cannot compute without source metadata |
| Structural Similarity | 0/100 | Cannot compute without source metadata |
| Governance Quality Impact | 0/100 | Cannot compute without source metadata |
| **Overall Score** | **0/100** | **Analysis blocked by missing input data** |

### Deduction Justification:
- **100-point deduction**: Complete inability to perform required analysis due to missing AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 metadata content

## 9. Migration Readiness Statement

**Migration Effort**: Cannot assess
**Blocking Issues**: 
1. **CRITICAL**: Source AAVA 1.0 metadata not provided
2. **CRITICAL**: Source AAVA 2.0 metadata not provided
3. Input contains placeholder text instead of actual JSON metadata

**Production Readiness Assessment**: **BLOCKED** - Analysis cannot proceed without actual metadata content

---

**RESOLUTION REQUIRED**: Please provide the actual AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 JSON metadata content to enable comprehensive comparison analysis.
