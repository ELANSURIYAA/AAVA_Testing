# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 61/100**
- The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 differ significantly in both semantic intent and structural approach.
- AAVA_1.0 focuses on basic PySpark aggregation for a GL table, while AAVA_2.0 attempts a more comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark mapping for a finance data loader, including error handling and JDBC output.
- **Semantic similarity is low (60/100)** due to divergent goals.
- **Structural similarity is also low (55/100)** as the decomposition and flow differ markedly.
- **Correctness is high for both (100/100)**, as both scripts are syntactically valid, but overall score is reduced due to lack of alignment.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 60/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  AAVA_1.0 implements a simple transformation and aggregation of a GL table.  
  AAVA_2.0 attempts a full conversion of an ABAP data loader, including error handling, schema definition, and JDBC output.
- **Key Observations:**  
  The goals and outcomes are only loosely related (both deal with finance data and PySpark), but the intent and complexity differ substantially.
- **Line References:**  
  - AAVA_1.0: lines 1-14  
  - AAVA_2.0: lines 1-74

### Structural Similarity (Score: 55/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  AAVA_1.0 has a linear, single-stage flow: read, transform, aggregate, print.  
  AAVA_2.0 is multi-stage: schema definition, file validation, data cleansing, error logging, column renaming, type casting, JDBC output, and extensive error handling.
- **Key Observations:**  
  The structure of decomposition is fundamentally different.
- **Line References:**  
  - AAVA_1.0: lines 1-14  
  - AAVA_2.0: lines 1-74

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**
- Syntax validation results: No syntax errors, all references are valid, PySpark code is well-formed.
- Line references: 1-14

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**
- Syntax validation results: No syntax errors, all references are valid, code blocks are complete and internally consistent.
- Line references: 1-74

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 60       | 60       | 60      |
| Structural Similarity | 55       | 55       | 55      |
| Correctness           | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -        | -        | **61**  |

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0 (lines 1-14):**  
  Consider expanding the script to handle schema validation, error logging, and output to a database for greater parity with AAVA_2.0.

- **AAVA_2.0 (lines 1-74):**  
  Consider simplifying the flow or modularizing for clarity; if the goal is simple GL aggregation, reduce complexity to match AAVA_1.0.
