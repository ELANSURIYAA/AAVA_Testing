# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 94/100
- Both agent outputs fulfill the core intent and reach similar conclusions, with slight differences in terminology and emphasis. Structural similarity is high, but one output introduces an additional section (lines 15-18) absent in the other. Syntax correctness is perfect for both agents (100/100).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- Both outputs address the same objective and intent, applying equivalent transformations and logic to reach aligned conclusions.
- Minor divergence in phrasing is observed at lines 7-10, but does not impact the overall meaning.
- The inferred goal is consistently interpreted in both outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 90/100)

- The logical flow and decomposition are nearly identical.
- However, agent_2_string_true introduces an additional section at lines 15-18 that is absent in agent_1_string_true, resulting in slight structural divergence.
- All other structural blocks and steps are present in both outputs.

### Correctness

**Agent agent_1_string_true: 100/100**

- All syntax is valid.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**Agent agent_2_string_true: 100/100**

- All syntax is valid.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

- Both outputs are syntactically flawless.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | agent_1_string_true | agent_2_string_true | Overall |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 92                 | 92                  | 92      |
| Structural Similarity | 90                 | 90                  | 90      |
| Correctness           | 100                | 100                 | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -                  | -                   | **94**  |

## Recommendations

- **Agent agent_1_string_true (lines 15-18):** Consider adding the section present in agent_2_string_true at lines 15-18 to match structure and improve completeness.
- **Agent agent_2_string_true:** No syntax issues detected. Maintain current correctness level.
