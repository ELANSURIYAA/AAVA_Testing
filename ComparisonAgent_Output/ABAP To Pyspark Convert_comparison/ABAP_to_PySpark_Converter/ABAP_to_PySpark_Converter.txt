Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,63,,"The outputs from comparison_input/AAVA_1.0/ABAP_to_PySpark_Converter.txt and comparison_input/AAVA_2.0/abap_to_pyspark_converter.txt differ substantially in both semantic intent and structural decomposition. The first output is a minimal PySpark script for reading a parquet file, labeling values, and aggregating, while the second is a comprehensive conversion of an ABAP finance load program, including schema definition, CSV ingestion, error handling, and JDBC output. Semantic similarity is moderate (60/100), structural similarity is low (50/100), and correctness is high for both (100/100). Overall score: 63/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,60,"1-17 (AAVA_1.0), 1-73 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 focuses on reading and processing a GL table from Parquet, labeling a column and aggregating, while AAVA_2.0 provides a full conversion of an ABAP program for finance data, including schema definition, CSV reading, error handling, and database writing. The inferred business goal (finance data load) is loosely aligned, but the specific logic and coverage are substantially different."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,50,"1-17 (AAVA_1.0), 1-73 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 is a single-flow script with basic read, transform, and aggregate steps. AAVA_2.0 is multi-phase: schema definition, file load, error handling, data transformation, and JDBC output. The decomposition and logical blocks differ fundamentally, with AAVA_2.0 mapping more ABAP features and data integrity checks."

Detailed Analysis,Correctness,comparison_input/AAVA_2.0/abap_to_pyspark_converter.txt,100,"1-73","Syntax is correct throughout. Python and PySpark constructs are valid; error handling, DataFrame operations, and JDBC write logic are well-formed. No undefined variables or broken references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-17 (AAVA_1.0), 1-73 (AAVA_2.0)","To improve semantic and structural alignment, AAVA_1.0 should expand its logic to include schema definition, file format checks, error handling, and target table writing, mirroring the ABAP conversion approach in AAVA_2.0."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-73 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_2.0 could further clarify input/output expectations and ensure all ABAP constructs are mapped for completeness, but its current structure is robust and well-formed."
