Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both migration validation scripts (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt) achieve very high semantic and structural similarity, with minor differences in implementation details and configuration approach. Syntax correctness is nearly perfect for both, with the second script having minor issues in error handling (see lines 160-165). Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, simulating ABAP output, transforming and aggregating with PySpark, and generating a reconciliation report. They cover the same transformation intent (row/column match, aggregation, audit report). Minor divergence: the second script adds more configuration and storage abstraction (lines 12-70), but overall intent and output are aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"12-70, 83-160","Both scripts follow a modular validation workflow: initialization, parsing, simulation, conversion, storage transfer, PySpark transformation, comparison, reporting. The second script introduces more explicit config and utility sections (lines 12-70), while the first script embeds most logic in a class. Both include a main orchestration block and test cases. Structure is highly similar with minor block ordering differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"Script is syntactically correct with well-formed Python, proper imports, no undefined variables, and clear control flow. Pytest script is valid (lines 160+). No errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,95,"160-165","Script is syntactically correct overall. Minor issue: error handling in the exec block (lines 160-165) could fail if 'renamed_df' does not exist, leading to a possible NoneType error. Otherwise, imports and logic are well-formed."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"160-165","Improve error handling in exec block: ensure 'renamed_df' existence before accessing to avoid NoneType errors."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"12-70","Consider simplifying configuration and utility sections for readability, as the first agent's class-based structure is more concise."
