Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both agent outputs (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt) achieve very high semantic similarity (97/100), each delivering robust ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation with automation, error handling, and reconciliation reporting. Minor differences exist in external connectivity, configuration, and test coverage. Structural similarity is strong (95/100), with both following a multi-step orchestration but differing in modularization and integration points. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100); no syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both outputs implement ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, including parsing source code, simulated/external execution, conversion to Parquet, distributed storage transfer, PySpark transformation, and reconciliation reporting. The main semantic difference is the handling of external connections: 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt includes optional SAP RFC and S3/HDFS integration logic, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt operates primarily in simulation. Both address error handling, auditability, and automated scheduling."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"1-160, 161-270 (1.0 1), 1-140, 141-290 (2.0 1)","Both scripts employ stepwise orchestration: parsing, execution, transformation, transfer, comparison, and reporting. 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt uses a class-based design with a main validator object and a full pytest suite for transformation logic (lines 161-270), while 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses functional decomposition and environmental configuration blocks. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt integrates connection and storage setup at the top level, whereas 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt modularizes these within methods. Minor divergence in how reporting and comparison are structured (see lines referenced)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors, all imports valid, class and function definitions are well-formed. Variables and references are internally consistent. The pytest script is syntactically correct and executable (lines 161-270)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors, all imports valid, function and block-level decomposition is correct. Environmental variable usage and error handling are robust; all control flow and references are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 100 (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt) and 100 (2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,,"1-160","Consider adding explicit external SAP RFC and distributed storage connection logic as in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt to support production scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,,"141-290","Consider adding integrated test coverage (e.g., pytest suite) as implemented in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt to increase transformation reliability."
