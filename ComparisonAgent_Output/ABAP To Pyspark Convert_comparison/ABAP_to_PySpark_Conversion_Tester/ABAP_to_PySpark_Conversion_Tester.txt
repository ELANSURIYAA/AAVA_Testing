# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} contain placeholder text rather than actual agent outputs to compare.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output
- **Agent 2**: Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output  
- **Overall**: Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

Please provide actual agent outputs in place of the template variables to enable comprehensive comparison and scoring.
