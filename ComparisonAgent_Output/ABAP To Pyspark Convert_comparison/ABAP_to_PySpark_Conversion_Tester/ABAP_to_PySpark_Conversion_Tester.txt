Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,65,,"Outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 target different data processing scenarios: AAVA_1.0 covers transformation and aggregation logic for a DataFrame, while AAVA_2.0 focuses on CSV ingestion, error handling, and ETL to a target table. Semantic and structural similarity are moderate due to different domains and validation targets. Syntax correctness is perfect for both. Overall score: 65/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,55,"All","AAVA_1.0 validates DataFrame transformation and aggregation logic (status assignment, sum aggregation), while AAVA_2.0 validates row-wise CSV ingestion, schema conformance, and error handling. The intent overlaps at a high-level (data pipeline validation), but the business logic and technical focus diverge."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"All","AAVA_1.0 uses test cases for DataFrame manipulation and PySpark-based assertion. AAVA_2.0's test cases focus on file ingestion, error handling, and schema validation. Both use pytest, similar test case decomposition, and fixtures, but the detailed steps and flows differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,"All","All code blocks are syntactically valid Python/pytest. No broken references or undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,"All","All code blocks are syntactically valid Python/pytest. No broken references or undefined variables."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"All","For higher alignment, clarify if both agents should target the same data domain and pipeline logic. Consider harmonizing test case focus (ETL, transformation, or aggregation)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,"All","Maintain test case documentation in a standardized table format for easier comparison and auditability."
