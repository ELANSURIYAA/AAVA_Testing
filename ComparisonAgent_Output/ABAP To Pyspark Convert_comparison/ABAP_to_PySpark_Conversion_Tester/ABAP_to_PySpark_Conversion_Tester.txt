# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 97/100**
- Both agent outputs achieve high semantic similarity (96/100) with only minor differences in terminology and approach.
- Structural similarity is strong (93/100), though Agent_Alpha omits a helper function present in Agent_Beta (lines 13-17).
- Syntax correctness is perfect for Agent_Beta (100/100); Agent_Alpha contains a minor indentation error (line 22).
- Overall, both agents demonstrate high quality, with actionable improvements for Agent_Alpha.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 96/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective and demonstrate aligned intent. The transformations and final outcomes are equivalent, with only superficial differences in terminology and minor variations in reasoning. Both agents correctly interpret the task requirements and deliver comparable results.

**Key Observations:**
- Both apply equivalent logic and reach the same conclusions.
- Minor differences in wording and approach, but no meaningful divergence in meaning.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 93/100)

The logical flow and decomposition of both outputs are highly similar. However, Agent_Alpha omits a helper function that is present in Agent_Beta (lines 13-17), resulting in slight structural divergence.

**Key Observations:**
- Overall structure and flow are consistent.
- Agent_Beta includes a helper function (lines 13-17) that is missing in Agent_Alpha, which impacts modularity and maintainability.

### Correctness

**Agent_Alpha: 98/100**
- Syntax is valid throughout except for a minor indentation error at line 22.
- No undefined variables or broken references detected.

**Agent_Beta: 100/100**
- Syntax is perfect; all code is well-formed.
- No undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors.

**Overall Correctness: 99/100**
- Averaged from Agent_Alpha (98) and Agent_Beta (100).

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect               | Agent_Alpha | Agent_Beta | Overall |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity  | 96          | 96         | 96      |
| Structural Similarity| 93          | 93         | 93      |
| Correctness          | 98          | 100        | 99      |
| **Overall**          | -           | -          | **97**  |

## Recommendations

- **Agent_Alpha (lines 13-17):** Add the missing helper function to match the modular structure present in Agent_Beta.
- **Agent_Alpha (line 22):** Fix the indentation error to achieve perfect syntax correctness.
