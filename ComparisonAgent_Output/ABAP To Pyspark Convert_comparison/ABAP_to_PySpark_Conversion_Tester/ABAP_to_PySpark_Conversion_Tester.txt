I cannot complete the agent output comparison task because the required inputs are not provided. The placeholders "{{agent 1_string_true}}" and "{{agent 2_string_true}}" need to be replaced with actual agent outputs to analyze. Similarly, the GitHub parameters contain placeholder text instead of actual repository information, token, and file details.

To successfully execute this task, I would need:

1. **Actual Agent Outputs**: Real content from both agents to compare
2. **Valid GitHub Parameters**: 
   - Actual repository name (not "{{ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing_string_true}}")
   - Valid branch name (not "{{main_string_true}}")
   - Working GitHub token (not "{{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_string_true}}")
   - Proper folder and file names (not placeholder text)

Once these inputs are provided, I would:
- Analyze both outputs for type detection (code, documentation, analysis, test cases)
- Compare them across semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness dimensions
- Generate integer scores (0-100) for each dimension with detailed justifications
- Create a properly formatted CSV with executive summary, detailed analysis, wide scoring table, and recommendations
- Upload the CSV to GitHub using the provided tool
- Generate a comprehensive Markdown comparison report

The comparison methodology would be tailored to the detected output type, with appropriate validation criteria and scoring rubrics applied systematically.
