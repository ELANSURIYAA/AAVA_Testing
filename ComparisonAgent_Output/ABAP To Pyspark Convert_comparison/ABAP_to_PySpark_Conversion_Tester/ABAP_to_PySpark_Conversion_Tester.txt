Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,65,,"The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 are both test case suites and corresponding PySpark pytest scripts, but they target different transformation logic and data domains. AAVA_1.0 focuses on GL data transformation and aggregation, whereas AAVA_2.0 handles CSV ingestion and validation logic for SAP BW-style table loading. Semantic similarity is limited (60/100), as is structural similarity (65/100), due to different test coverage and logic focus. Syntax correctness is high for both (100/100, 100/100). Overall: 65/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,60,"1-60 (AAVA_1.0), 1-170 (AAVA_2.0)","AAVA_1.0 tests a transformation/aggregation pipeline on GL data, including value threshold logic, null handling, and data types. AAVA_2.0 tests row and file validation for CSV ingestion, focusing on column count, error handling, and data-type-agnostic loads. The core intent (robust data pipeline testing) is related, but the underlying transformations, error handling, and logic are different. There is overlap in edge case/error testing, but the semantics diverge in data focus and expected outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"1-60 (AAVA_1.0), 1-170 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs provide a test case table/list followed by detailed pytest scripts, but their internal structure differs: AAVA_1.0 groups tests by transformation scenario and then by error/boundary case, with functions tightly coupled to transformation logic; AAVA_2.0 uses more granular test cases for various CSV file conditions and mocks JDBC writes. The order and logic decomposition differ, but both maintain clear test case mapping and function-level test isolation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,"1-60","All Python and PySpark code is syntactically valid, with proper fixture usage, function definitions, and exception handling. No undefined variables or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,"1-170","All code is syntactically valid. The use of pytest, SparkSession, temp files, and mocks is correct. No broken references or syntax errors found."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_1.0,,"1-60","To improve alignment, consider extending test coverage to include CSV ingestion scenarios, column count validation, and explicit error handling for malformed input files as in AAVA_2.0."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_2.0,,"1-170","To improve semantic alignment, add transformation logic tests (e.g., value thresholding, status assignment, aggregation) similar to AAVA_1.0, and clarify the mapping between CSV ingestion and downstream data transformation."
