# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 64/100
- **Key Findings:**  
  - The two outputs, AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0, both deliver PySpark-based automated test suites but target fundamentally different business scenarios.
  - **AAVA_1.0** focuses on transformation and aggregation logic for GL data, with test cases for numeric value classification and sum aggregation.
  - **AAVA_2.0** is centered on file ingestion, schema validation, and error handling for CSV data loads, including edge cases like missing files and incorrect row formats.
  - **Semantic similarity** is moderate (64/100) due to divergent test objectives.
  - **Structural similarity** is low (55/100) because of different function/test decomposition and flow.
  - **Correctness** is perfect (100/100) for both; code is syntactically valid and internally consistent.
- **Major Differences:**  
  - Business logic focus, structure of test cases, and test coverage are not aligned.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 64/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  - AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 do not address the same business problem.
    - **AAVA_1.0**: Tests transformation (status assignment based on value) and aggregation (sum) for GL data.
    - **AAVA_2.0**: Tests CSV ingestion, file/row format validation, error handling, and data type robustness.
  - Only partial overlap exists in the use of PySpark and automated testing, but core intent and scenarios differ.
- **Line References:**  
  - AAVA_1.0: Lines 1–80  
  - AAVA_2.0: Lines 1–180

### Structural Similarity (Score: 55/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  - Structural decomposition is fundamentally different:
    - **AAVA_1.0**: Organized as a transformation/aggregation test suite; each test targets a business rule or edge case for data values.
    - **AAVA_2.0**: Organized as a file ingestion/error handling suite; helpers for temporary files, mocks for JDBC, and extensive error simulation.
  - No shared function names, control flow, or test breakdown.
- **Line References:**  
  - AAVA_1.0: Lines 1–80  
  - AAVA_2.0: Lines 1–180

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**

- All Python and PySpark code is well-formed.
- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected.
- (Lines 1–80)

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**

- All Python and PySpark code is well-formed.
- No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected.
- (Lines 1–180)

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 64       | 64       | 64      |
| Structural Similarity | 55       | 55       | 55      |
| Correctness           | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -        | -        | **64**  |

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0** (Lines 1–80):  
  - Consider extending test coverage to include file ingestion and error handling scenarios similar to those in AAVA_2.0, e.g., empty input, invalid schema, file not found.

- **AAVA_2.0** (Lines 1–180):  
  - Consider adding transformation and aggregation logic tests for business rules as present in AAVA_1.0, such as value-based status assignment and sum aggregation validation.
