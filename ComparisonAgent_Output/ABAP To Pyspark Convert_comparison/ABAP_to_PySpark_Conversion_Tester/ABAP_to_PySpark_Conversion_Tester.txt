# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score: 55/100**
- **Key Findings:** The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 are both high-quality test suites for PySpark/ABAP conversion, but they target fundamentally different business logic and transformation scenarios. Semantic and structural similarity are low (55/100 and 45/100, respectively) because AAVA_1.0 focuses on value-based status assignment and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 targets CSV-to-table ETL with schema/row validation and error handling. Both exhibit excellent syntax-level correctness (100/100).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 55/100)

- **Analysis:** The core intent and transformation logic differ. AAVA_1.0 tests value-based status assignment and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 tests CSV ingestion, schema validation, and error handling. There is some overlap in data quality and transformation themes, but the test goals and business logic are distinct.
- **Line references:** Full file (AAVA_1.0: lines 1-100, AAVA_2.0: lines 1-150).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 45/100)

- **Analysis:** AAVA_1.0 uses a classic test-case-per-function approach (transformation, aggregation, boundaries), while AAVA_2.0 employs a data-driven, file-based ETL test harness with mocks and error simulation. Test case decomposition, control flow, and validation steps are structurally different.
- **Line references:** AAVA_1.0: lines 1-100; AAVA_2.0: lines 1-150.

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**
- All test cases and pytest code in AAVA_1.0 are syntactically correct: fixtures, assertions, and helper functions are well-formed (lines 12-100). No syntax errors found.

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**
- All test cases and pytest code in AAVA_2.0 are syntactically correct: fixtures, helper functions, class mocks, and assertions are well-formed (lines 12-150). No syntax errors found.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 55       | 55       | 55      |
| Structural Similarity | 45       | 45       | 45      |
| Correctness           | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -        | -        | **55**  |

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0 (lines 1-100):** To increase alignment with AAVA_2.0, consider expanding test coverage to include file ingestion, schema validation, and error handling typical of ETL jobs, not just transformation logic.
- **AAVA_2.0 (lines 1-150):** If relevant, add test cases for value-based transformations and aggregations, similar to those in AAVA_1.0, to improve business logic coverage.
