# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 56/100
- **Summary:** The outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 target fundamentally different processes and data domains. AAVA_1.0 focuses on PySpark column-wise transformation and aggregation, while AAVA_2.0 centers on CSV ingestion, row validation, and error handling for finance data loading. There is no semantic alignment, the structures are unrelated, and test case design is orthogonal. However, both outputs are syntactically correct and well-formed.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 10/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  - **AAVA_1.0**: Tests transformation logic (assigning 'High'/'Normal' status based on column values) and aggregation (summing values) for a DataFrame.
  - **AAVA_2.0**: Tests CSV ingestion, row length validation, error handling, and data loading into a target table.
  - **Observation:** There is no overlap in business logic, data model, or test intent. Each agent addresses a different functional domain.
- **Line references:** All lines, as the entire outputs are divergent in purpose.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 20/100)

- **Analysis:**  
  - Both outputs provide a test case matrix and a corresponding pytest script.
  - **AAVA_1.0**: Structure is built around column-wise logic, with test cases for value-based status assignment and aggregation.
  - **AAVA_2.0**: Structure is based on row-wise file ingestion, validation, and error state handling.
  - **Observation:** While both use test matrices and pytest, the logical decomposition and flow are unrelated.
- **Line references:** Entire outputs (AAVA_1.0 lines 1–107, AAVA_2.0 lines 1–151).

### Correctness

**AAVA_1.0: 100/100**

- **Validation:**  
  - No syntax errors in the test case list or pytest script (lines 1–107).
  - All references, indentation, and logic are correct.

**AAVA_2.0: 100/100**

- **Validation:**  
  - No syntax errors in the test case matrix or pytest code (lines 1–151).
  - All helper functions, fixtures, and assertions are valid.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect                | AAVA_1.0 | AAVA_2.0 | Overall |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity   | 10       | 10       | 10      |
| Structural Similarity | 20       | 20       | 20      |
| Correctness           | 100      | 100      | 100     |
| **Overall**           | -        | -        | **56**  |

## Recommendations

- **AAVA_1.0:** If alignment with AAVA_2.0 is desired, introduce file ingestion, row validation, and error handling test cases.
- **AAVA_2.0:** If alignment with AAVA_1.0 is desired, introduce column transformation, aggregation, and numeric logic test cases.
- **Both:** Clarify business requirements to ensure both agents target the same functional scope for future comparisons.
