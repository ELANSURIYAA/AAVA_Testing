Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided inputs contain placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. To complete this analysis, please provide the actual content generated by both agents for comparison."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure both outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Include any relevant context or requirements for the ABAP to PySpark conversion task. 4. Re-run this comparison tool once actual outputs are available."
