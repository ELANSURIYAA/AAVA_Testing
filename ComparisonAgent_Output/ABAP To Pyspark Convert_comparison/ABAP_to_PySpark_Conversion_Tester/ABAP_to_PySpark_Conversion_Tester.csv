Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - input agent outputs contain unresolved placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}. No actual content was provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables were provided instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables were provided instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - no actual output content provided for Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - no actual output content provided for Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure input preprocessing resolves all template variables before analysis. 3. Verify data pipeline integrity to prevent placeholder passthrough."
