Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,55,,"Outputs from AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 address distinct tasks: AAVA_1.0 provides transformation and aggregation test cases for value-based status assignment in a DataFrame, while AAVA_2.0 focuses on CSV ingestion and error handling for a SAP BW-like table load. Their semantic overlap is minimal (55/100). Structural approaches differ, with AAVA_1.0 emphasizing transformation logic and AAVA_2.0 emphasizing file parsing and error checks (structure: 62/100). Syntax correctness is high in both, with minor test fixture scope variation in AAVA_2.0. Overall: 72/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,55,"All","AAVA_1.0 (lines 1-99) defines tests for column-based transformation and aggregation logic. AAVA_2.0 (lines 1-181) defines tests for CSV file loading, error handling, and integration with SAP BW. The intent, logic, and business goals are fundamentally different, with only superficial overlap (both are PySpark test suites for data processing)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,62,"All","AAVA_1.0 organizes by test case on DataFrame transformation, each with a corresponding pytest function, while AAVA_2.0 organizes by test case on file loading and error handling, with helper functions for file I/O and JDBC. Both use pytest structure and fixtures, but the decomposition and tested logic diverge."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,"1-99","All test cases use valid Python and PySpark syntax, fixtures, and assertions. No undefined variables or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,95,"1-181","All code is syntactically valid. Minor divergence: Spark fixture uses module scope (line 16), which may lead to reuse issues in some pytest environments, but not a syntax error. Helper function and test structure valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of AAVA_1.0 (100) and AAVA_2.0 (95)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"All","If harmonization is desired, align business logic and test focus: either extend AAVA_1.0 to include file ingestion/error handling, or extend AAVA_2.0 to include value-based transformation and aggregation logic. This will improve both semantic and structural alignment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"AAVA_2.0 line 16","Consider using function-scoped Spark fixtures for test isolation, unless module scope is required for performance reasons."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"All","Adopt consistent naming conventions and test documentation style across both agents to facilitate future comparisons and integration."
