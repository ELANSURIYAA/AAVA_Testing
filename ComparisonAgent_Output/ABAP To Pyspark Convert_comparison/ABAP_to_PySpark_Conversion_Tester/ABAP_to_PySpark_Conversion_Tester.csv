Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. This comparison framework is ready for execution once actual agent outputs are provided."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework established for ABAP to PySpark conversion comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework established for code structure analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual ABAP conversion output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual PySpark conversion output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs."
