Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. To complete the comparison, please provide the actual agent outputs for ABAP to PySpark conversion testing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain ABAP to PySpark conversion code or documentation. 3. Include line numbers in outputs for precise reference. 4. Specify the exact nature of the conversion task (data migration, logic translation, etc.)."
