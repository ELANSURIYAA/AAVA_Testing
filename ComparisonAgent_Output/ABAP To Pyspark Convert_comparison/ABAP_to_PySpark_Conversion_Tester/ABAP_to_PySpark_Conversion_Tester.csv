Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. This CSV structure demonstrates the expected format for automated agent output comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would compare meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would analyze logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."
