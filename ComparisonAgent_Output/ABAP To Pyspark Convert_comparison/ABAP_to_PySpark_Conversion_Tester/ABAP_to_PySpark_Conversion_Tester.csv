Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comprehensive comparison as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual agent outputs. This analysis framework is ready to execute once valid agent outputs are provided."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison framework requires concrete outputs to analyze meaning, intent, and purpose alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison framework requires concrete outputs to analyze logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual agent output. Framework ready to validate code syntax, undefined variables, and broken references once output is provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual agent output. Framework ready to validate code syntax, undefined variables, and broken references once output is provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent assessments. Average of individual scores would be computed once valid outputs are analyzed."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comprehensive comparison analysis. 2. Ensure outputs include line numbers for precise reference tracking. 3. Specify the exact nature of the ABAP to PySpark conversion task for context-aware evaluation. 4. Include any specific requirements or constraints for the conversion process."
