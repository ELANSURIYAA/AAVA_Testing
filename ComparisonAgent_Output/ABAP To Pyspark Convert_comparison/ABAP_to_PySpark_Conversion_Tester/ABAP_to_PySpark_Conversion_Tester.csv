Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison instead of empty placeholders"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"2. Ensure input variables are properly substituted before running comparison"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"3. Verify that agent outputs contain ABAP to PySpark conversion content as indicated by the task context"
