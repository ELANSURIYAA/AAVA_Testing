Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} contain placeholder text rather than actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs."
