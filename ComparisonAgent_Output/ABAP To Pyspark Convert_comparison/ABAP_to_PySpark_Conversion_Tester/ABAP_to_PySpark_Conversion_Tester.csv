Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,61,,"AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 both provide test suites for PySpark code, but target different inferred ABAP-to-PySpark conversion scenarios. Semantic overlap is low (60/100) due to divergent intent and business logic. Structural similarity is moderate (65/100) as both use pytest and DataFrame-based validation, but organize test coverage differently. Syntax correctness is high for both outputs (100/100 for AAVA_1.0, 98/100 for AAVA_2.0; see lines 198-202 for minor docstring/markdown issues in AAVA_2.0). Overall score: 61/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,60,,"AAVA_1.0 focuses on validating a transformation and aggregation on a PySpark DataFrame (status assignment and sum), while AAVA_2.0 tests file ingestion, error handling, and table loading for a converted ABAP program. The underlying business logic, test cases, and expected outcomes are not aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"1-198 (AAVA_1.0), 1-202 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs use pytest, fixtures, and DataFrame validation, but their test decomposition, helper function structure, and coverage granularity differ. AAVA_1.0 has 5 test cases focused on transformation logic, AAVA_2.0 has 10-11 cases focused on file parsing and error handling. Table and docstring/markdown structure diverge." 
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,1-198,"All code and test cases are syntactically valid Python and PySpark. No undefined variables, all fixtures and assertions are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,98,198-202,"Minor issues: markdown code fences and header separation not strictly valid within a .py file (lines 198-202); otherwise, code is syntactically correct and all test cases are runnable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of AAVA_1.0 (100) and AAVA_2.0 (98)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,1-202,"To improve semantic and structural alignment, harmonize test objectives: either unify both outputs around the same transformation/aggregation logic or extend each suite to cover the other's business rules. For AAVA_2.0, move markdown and docstring blocks outside the code or into comments for stricter syntax compliance."
