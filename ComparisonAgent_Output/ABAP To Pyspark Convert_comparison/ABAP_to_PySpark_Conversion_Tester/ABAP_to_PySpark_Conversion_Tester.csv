Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No meaningful comparison can be conducted without the actual content from both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text detected in input where agent outputs should be provided."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure both agents have completed their ABAP to PySpark conversion tasks. 3. Re-run this comparison tool with valid agent outputs. 4. Verify that the agent outputs contain actual code, documentation, or analysis content rather than template variables."
