Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt deliver robust, auditable ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation frameworks. They share the same migration validation intent and implement nearly identical validation flows. Minor differences exist in error handling, configuration flexibility, and test coverage. Both scripts are syntactically correct and production-grade. Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both outputs implement ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation with detailed reconciliation reporting, error handling, and automation readiness. The intent, business logic, and core steps are aligned. Minor differences: 1.0 1 includes an explicit pytest suite (lines 148-228) and more in-script documentation; 2.0 1 offers greater flexibility for distributed storage and ABAP RFC, with more parameterization (lines 36-113). These do not alter the core meaning or outcome."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"36-113,148-228","The structural flow is nearly identical: initialization, ABAP input parsing, execution simulation, CSV-to-Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark DataFrame transformation, results comparison, and reporting. 1.0 1 includes a full pytest test suite (lines 148-228), while 2.0 1 has a more modular configuration block and storage abstraction (lines 36-113), slightly diverging in decomposition but not in core logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, class/method structure, and pytest test cases are well-formed. Logging, error handling, and resource management are robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,99,"93-104","Syntactically correct throughout. Minor risk: use of os.rename in transfer_to_storage (line 104) may fail if source/destination are on different filesystems—os.replace or shutil.move is safer. Otherwise, all code blocks, error handling, and logging are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of (100) and (99) rounds to 100. Both scripts are production-ready and syntactically robust."
