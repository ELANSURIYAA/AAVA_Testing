Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt provide comprehensive Python-based ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation solutions. Semantic similarity is high (95/100), as both scripts orchestrate the same migration validation workflow with robust logging, simulation, and reporting. Structural similarity is strong (93/100), but 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses more modular utility functions and has an explicit configuration section, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt provides in-line documentation and an embedded pytest suite. Syntax correctness is perfect for both scripts (100/100). Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs target automated validation of ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including ABAP code parsing, execution simulation, CSV/Parquet conversion, distributed storage, PySpark transformation, and result reconciliation. Minor differences: 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt has more explicit support for SAP RFC and S3/HDFS, while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt includes a built-in pytest test suite and more step-by-step narrative (lines 1-50). Both scripts produce detailed reconciliation reports and robust error handling, with equivalent validation coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,93,"1-55, 56-450 (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt), 1-90, 91-335 (2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)","Both follow a multi-stage validation pipeline: initialization, input parsing, simulation or execution, CSV-to-Parquet, storage transfer, PySpark transformation, comparison, and report. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt uses utility functions (lines 30-120) for modularity and separates configuration (lines 19-60), while 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt embeds all logic in a class (lines 56-450) and includes a pytest script inline (lines 451+). Both use main guards and CLI argument parsing. Structural flow is nearly identical, but decomposition and modularity differ."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, function/class definitions, and script entry points are valid. Logging and error handling are consistent. Pytest suite is well-formed (lines 451+)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, function definitions, and main entry logic are well-structured. Logging, exception handling, and CLI parsing are robust. No undefined variables or broken references found."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"1-55, 451+ (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt), 19-120 (2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)","Consider extracting utility functions from 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt into separate modules for improved modularity, following the approach in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt (lines 19-120). Optionally, add an automated test suite to 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt as seen in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (lines 451+). Both scripts are highly robust and production-ready; unify configuration and utility logic for maintainability."
