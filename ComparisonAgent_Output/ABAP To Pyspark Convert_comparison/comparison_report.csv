Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt outputs achieve high semantic similarity (95/100), with minor differences in terminology and configuration. Structural similarity is strong (92/100), but 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt includes extended configuration and connection logic absent in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt (see lines 15-70). Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100). Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs implement a migration validation workflow from ABAP to PySpark, including table extraction, simulated execution, transformation, and reconciliation reporting. Minor differences exist in how ABAP connection and distributed storage are handled, but both achieve the same validation intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"15-70","Both scripts follow a similar logical sequence: parse ABAP and PySpark code, simulate/extract ABAP data, convert to Parquet, transfer to storage, load into PySpark, transform, compare, and generate a report. 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt includes more detailed configuration, connection setup, and storage abstraction (lines 15-70), whereas 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt uses direct simulation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All imports, function/class definitions, and code blocks are well-formed. Pytest script is also syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected. All configuration, imports, function definitions, and control flow are well-formed. Error handling and logging are robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of both agents (100, 100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"15-70","Consider simplifying configuration and connection setup for environments where full SAP RFC or distributed storage is not required, to match the streamlined approach of 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,,"Add extended configuration and connection logic as seen in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt for greater flexibility and enterprise integration."
