- All files in both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 were strictly validated for existence.
- No files in AAVA 1.0 with lowercase naming could be read; only uppercase and camelcase versions were accessible.
- No genuine one-to-one matches passed multi-gate validation due to missing corresponding artifacts or failed file reads.
- All comparisons are marked "Not Comparable" with "High" migration impact.
- Migration safety cannot be assured; manual review is required for all components.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a deterministic, strictly validated comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow output files. All available files were checked for physical existence and content extraction. Multi-gate matching (intent, signature, structure, semantic) was attempted for each possible file pair. Due to missing or unreadable files in both versions and strict one-to-one matching enforcement, no valid matches could be established. All components are flagged as "Not Comparable," and migration risk is high.

Note: 5 files in AAVA 1.0 (lowercase) could not be read, limiting comparison completeness.

- No valid one-to-one matches found; comparison is incomplete.
- All components flagged as "Not Comparable" due to missing or unreadable files.
- Migration impact is "High" for all components.
- Confidence in migration readiness is low due to input gaps.
- Manual review and remediation are required for business continuity.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line diff and content validation are used for genuine matches only. For this report, no valid pairs were established, so match percentage is "N/A" for all components.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication        |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes         |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only    |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring        |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes      |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review    |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file      |

- Match percentage is only calculated for valid matches.
- Dimension scores add depth to equivalence assessment.
- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.
- No PASS threshold met due to missing matches.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element        | Value         |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Final Recommendation   | NOT APPROVED  |
| Primary Justification  | No valid matches; migration risk is high |
| Confidence Level       | LOW           |
| Recommended Timeline   | Not recommended|
| Priority               | Action Required | Responsible Team | Timeline |

- The comparison cannot support migration due to missing or unreadable files.
- Manual review and remediation are urgently required.
- Migration is not recommended until all files are present and validated.

This report applies strict input validation and deterministic multi-gate matching. No valid one-to-one matches were found, and all components are flagged as high risk. Migration is not recommended until missing files are recovered and validated.

- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:
1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation

Match Percentage Formula:
```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:
- PASS: >= 90%
