- All files physically present in both versions were validated for existence.
- No genuinely matched pairs could be established due to gate failures or missing file content.
- All components are flagged "Not Comparable" due to strict input validation and multi-gate enforcement.
- Migration Impact is "High" for all components, reflecting inability to assess equivalence.
- The report signals incomplete comparison and mandates manual review before migration.

---

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This comparison report evaluates the outputs of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflows across five core components. Strict input validation and multi-gate matching were enforced, including intent, normalized signature, structural, and semantic analysis. No one-to-one matches could be established due to file content unavailability or gate failures. All components are marked "Not Comparable," resulting in a high migration impact and incomplete confidence in migration safety. Manual review and remediation are required before any migration decisions.

Note: 5 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- No valid matches were found between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 components.
- Strict validation prevented false positives and ensured truthful reporting.
- All unmatched files reduce confidence in migration safety.
- Migration risk is high due to incomplete comparison.
- Conditional recommendation: Do not proceed until all artifacts are validated and compared.
- Business continuity cannot be assured without further review.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line comparison is performed only for genuinely matched pairs passing all validation gates. For each valid pair, unchanged lines are counted and the match percentage is calculated as (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100, rounded to one decimal. No calculation is performed for unmatched or invalid pairs.

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication         |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes          |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only     |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring         |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes       |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review     |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file      |

- Match % is not reported for unmatched or invalid files.
- Dimension scores provide additional depth for valid matches.
- Both metrics are required for migration readiness.
- 90% threshold is required for PASS.

| Decision Element        | Value        |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Final Recommendation   | NOT APPROVED |
| Primary Justification  | No valid file matches; migration cannot be assessed |
| Confidence Level       | LOW          |
| Recommended Timeline   | Not recommended |
| Priority               | Action Required | Responsible Team         | Timeline     |
|------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| High                   | Manual review  | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team| Immediate    |

- Migration is not approved due to lack of valid matches.
- Immediate manual review of all artifacts is required.
- Responsible team must ensure files are present and pass all gates.
- No migration should occur until readiness is confirmed.
- Business continuity cannot be assured without further validation.

This report was prepared using strict input validation and multi-gate matching to ensure absolute determinism and truthfulness. No migration is recommended until all files are available and pass all comparison gates.

Comparison Methodology Summary:
Multi-gate matching framework with regex intent detection, normalized signature matching, structural similarity analysis, and semantic content comparison. SHA-256 hashing and line-by-line diff used for content validation. 10-dimension scoring framework applied to valid one-to-one matches. All calculations deterministic and reproducible.

Matching Gate Reference:
- Gate 1: Regex-based intent inference (must match)
- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:
1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation
6. Performance Patterns – Efficiency, scalability
7. Unit Test Coverage – Breadth, depth
8. Output Structure & Modularity – Organization, maintainability
9. Documentation Quality – Comments, docstrings
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence – Integration, outputs

Match Percentage Formula:
```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:
- PASS: >= 90%
- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%
