**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a rigorous, multi-gate validated comparison of five workflow output components from AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0. All files were present and matched strictly one-to-one, with no unmatched or invalid artifacts. The comparison utilized intent detection, normalized signature matching, structural and semantic analysis, and deterministic scoring. Two components are fully equivalent, two display minor differences, and one requires further review due to substantial changes. Overall, the migration readiness is high, but attention should be paid to the component flagged for review to ensure business continuity.

- The most significant finding is the strong equivalence in core testing and reconciliation components.
- Key strengths include excellent preservation of business logic and test coverage for most files.
- The "Conversion Tester" component requires review due to lower match percentage and dimension score.
- Confidence in migration is high for four components, conditional for one.
- Recommendation: Proceed with migration, but review the flagged component before production cutover.
- Business continuity is well supported, with minimal risk except for the reviewed area.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line comparison is performed for each genuinely matched pair. The number of unchanged lines is divided by the total number of lines to yield the match percentage, rounded to one decimal place. This metric is supplemented by a 10-dimension scoring framework to capture deeper equivalence beyond superficial similarity.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication        |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes         |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only    |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring        |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes      |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review    |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file     |

- Match percentage alone is not sufficient for migration readiness.
- Dimension scores provide depth and nuance to the assessment.
- Both metrics are required for a robust migration decision.
- A 90% threshold is set for unconditional PASS.

**APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL REFERENCE**

Comparison Methodology Summary:

Multi-gate matching framework with regex intent detection, normalized signature matching, structural similarity analysis, and semantic content comparison. SHA-256 hashing and line-by-line diff used for content validation. 10-dimension scoring framework applied to valid one-to-one matches. All calculations deterministic and reproducible.

Matching Gate Reference:

- Gate 1: Regex-based intent inference (must match)
- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:

1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation
6. Performance Patterns – Efficiency, scalability
7. Unit Test Coverage – Breadth, depth
8. Output Structure & Modularity – Organization, maintainability
9. Documentation Quality – Comments, docstrings
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence – Integration, outputs

Match Percentage Formula:

```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:

- PASS: >= 90%
- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%
- FAIL: < 75%
