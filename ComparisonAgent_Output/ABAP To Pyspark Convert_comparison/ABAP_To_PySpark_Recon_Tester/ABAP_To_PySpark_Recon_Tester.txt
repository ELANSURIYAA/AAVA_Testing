# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 97/100
- Both agent_1_output and agent_2_output demonstrate very high semantic similarity (97/100), with only minor differences in phrasing. Structural similarity is also excellent (95/100), as both outputs follow nearly identical logical flow, though agent_2_output includes a clarifying comment at line 7. Both outputs are syntactically correct, with agent_2_output exhibiting a minor indentation inconsistency at line 8. The overall quality and alignment are strong.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 97/100)

- Both outputs address the same core problem and apply the same logic.
- Differences are limited to word choice and minor phrasing, with no impact on the underlying meaning or intent.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 95/100)

- The outputs follow the same logical structure and step order.
- agent_2_output contains a clarifying comment at line 7 not present in agent_1_output. This addition does not alter the overall flow but represents a minor structural divergence.

### Correctness

**agent_1_output: 100/100**

- Syntax is valid throughout.
- No errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected.

**agent_2_output: 98/100**

- Syntax is valid overall.
- Minor indentation inconsistency at line 8, but no functional errors.

**Overall Correctness: 99/100**

- Calculated as the average of agent_1_output (100) and agent_2_output (98).
