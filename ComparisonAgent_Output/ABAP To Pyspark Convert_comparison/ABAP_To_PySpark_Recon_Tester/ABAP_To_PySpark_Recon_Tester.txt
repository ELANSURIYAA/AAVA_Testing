Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs implement a robust, automated ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation workflow. Their semantic intent and core validation logic are highly aligned (score: 97). The structural approach is nearly identical, with both using modular functions/classes and a main orchestration, but AAVA_2.0 separates utility/config more, and AAVA_1.0 includes inline pytest for transformation coverage (score: 94). Both scripts are syntactically correct and production-ready, with only minor documentation/casing inconsistencies (AAVA_2.0: line 1-5, AAVA_1.0: lines 10-16). Average correctness: 98. Overall: 96."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both scripts automate the end-to-end ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation process: reading/parsing ABAP and PySpark code, simulating/executing ABAP output, exporting to Parquet, transferring to storage, loading as external table in PySpark, running transformation, comparing results, and generating reconciliation reports. Minor differences exist: AAVA_1.0 simulates ABAP output with dummy data and focuses on GL table, while AAVA_2.0 provides parameterized config for SAP, S3/HDFS/LOCAL, and expects real ABAP/PySpark code or CSV fallback. Both generate detailed JSON reports, robust logging, and error handling. Both scripts validate transformation logic equivalence, but AAVA_1.0 embeds pytest cases for test coverage, while AAVA_2.0 assumes correctness by execution and data comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,94,"1-80 (AAVA_1.0), 1-120 (AAVA_2.0)","Both scripts follow a similar stepwise orchestration: configuration, ABAP parsing/execution, CSV/Parquet export, storage transfer, PySpark transformation, result comparison, and report generation. AAVA_1.0 uses a class-based design (ABAPtoPySparkMigrationValidator) with methods for each phase, and includes inline pytest for transformation logic. AAVA_2.0 is more functionally decomposed, with explicit utility/config sections and a main() function. AAVA_2.0 is more extensible for real SAP/storage, while AAVA_1.0 is simulation-focused and includes test scaffolding. Minor structural divergence: test code is integrated in AAVA_1.0, not present in AAVA_2.0; AAVA_2.0's config is more modular and robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,99,"10-16, 300-320","AAVA_1.0 is syntactically correct, with robust error handling and logging. The only minor issue is that some docstrings and comments (lines 10-16) reference simulated steps that may not match actual code paths in a production deployment. Pytest section (lines 300-320) is well-formed, but could be separated for clarity. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,97,"1-5, 70-90","AAVA_2.0 is syntactically correct and production-ready. Minor documentation/casing inconsistencies (lines 1-5: inconsistent comment casing, lines 70-90: fallback behavior for missing ABAP CSV may create empty DataFrame without warning). All imports, logging, and orchestration are well-formed. No syntax errors detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"10-16","AAVA_1.0: Consider making simulation/production code paths clearer in documentation/comments for lines 10-16. Separate pytest test suite into a standalone file for best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,"1-5, 70-90","AAVA_2.0: Standardize comment casing for consistency (lines 1-5). Warn user more explicitly when ABAP CSV fallback creates an empty DataFrame (lines 70-90)."
