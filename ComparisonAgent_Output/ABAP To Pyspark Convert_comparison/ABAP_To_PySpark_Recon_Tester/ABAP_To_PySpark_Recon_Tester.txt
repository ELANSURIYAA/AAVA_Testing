# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Unable to perform comparison analysis - agent outputs not provided in input. The system received placeholders `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual content to compare.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The input contained only placeholder variables rather than the actual content that needs to be analyzed.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. No content structure can be assessed from placeholder variables.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1:** Score 0/100 - Agent 1 output not provided
- **Agent 2:** Score 0/100 - Agent 2 output not provided
- **Overall:** Score 0/100 - Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs:** Replace placeholder variables with the actual content that needs to be compared and analyzed.

2. **Ensure Content Completeness:** Verify that both agent outputs contain the full content to be evaluated rather than template variables.

3. **Re-run Analysis:** Once actual outputs are provided, re-execute the comparison process to obtain meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness scores.
