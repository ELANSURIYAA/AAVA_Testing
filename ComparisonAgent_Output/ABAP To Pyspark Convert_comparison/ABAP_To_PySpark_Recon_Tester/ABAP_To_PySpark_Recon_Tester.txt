## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score:** 95/100
- Both `agent1_string_true` and `agent2_string_true` outputs achieve high semantic and structural similarity (95/100), with only minor differences in section order and terminology. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100). No critical errors found. Overall, both agents demonstrate strong alignment and high-quality output.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

- **Analysis:** Both outputs address the same core objective with aligned intent. Minor terminology and emphasis differences are observed but do not impact overall meaning. Both apply equivalent transformations and reach the same conclusions.
- **Key Observations:** Terminology and slight emphasis differences are present but do not alter meaning.
- **Line References:** Notable minor differences, but no significant divergence.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

- **Analysis:** The overall flow is nearly identical, but `agent2_string_true` reorders one section (lines 10-15) compared to `agent1_string_true`, resulting in minor structural divergence.
- **Key Observations:** Section ordering difference at lines 10-15 in `agent2_string_true`.
- **Line References:** 10-15

### Correctness

**agent1_string_true: 100/100**
- Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**agent2_string_true: 100/100**
- Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**
