Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs deliver comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation scripts, with robust automation, reporting, and error handling. Semantic similarity is very high (97/100), as both scripts implement the same end-to-end validation workflow and reporting. Structural similarity is strong (94/100), with both scripts decomposing the workflow into modular functions/classes, though AAVA_2.0 uses more configuration and utility functions while AAVA_1.0 relies on a class-based approach. Syntax correctness is perfect for both outputs (100/100). Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,"1-110 (AAVA_1.0), 1-170 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs implement a full ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation pipeline: input parsing, simulated/external ABAP execution, CSV/Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark transformation, comparison, and JSON report generation. Minor semantic divergence: AAVA_2.0 includes more flexible distributed storage handling (S3/HDFS/Local), environment-based configuration, and more detailed schema handling. AAVA_1.0 emphasizes test coverage (pytest section) and step-by-step orchestration in a class. Both reach the same overall outcome."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,94,"1-110 (AAVA_1.0), 1-170 (AAVA_2.0)","Both outputs structure the workflow into modular components: input parsing, execution, conversion, transfer, transformation, comparison, and reporting. AAVA_1.0 uses a class-based approach with methods for each stage, while AAVA_2.0 uses utility functions, a main() orchestrator, and configuration sections. AAVA_2.0 has additional configuration and logging setup, and more explicit error handling functions. Both scripts generate reconciliation reports and log outcomes, but AAVA_2.0's structure is slightly more decomposed and configurable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_1.0,100,"1-110","Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected. All imports are present and used correctly. Class and method definitions are well-formed. Pytest section is syntactically correct and runnable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_2.0,100,"1-170","Syntax is valid throughout. No undefined variables, broken references, or structural errors detected. All imports and utility functions are present and used correctly. Configuration and logging setup are well-formed. Main workflow is properly orchestrated."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_1.0,,"1-110","Consider adding environment-based configuration and flexible distributed storage handling (S3/HDFS/local) as implemented in AAVA_2.0 for broader deployment scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_2.0,,"1-170","Consider including explicit test coverage (as in the pytest section of AAVA_1.0) to enhance validation and regression protection for transformation logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"1-110, 1-170","Both outputs would benefit from unified documentation and clearer separation between simulation and production code paths for improved maintainability and auditability."
