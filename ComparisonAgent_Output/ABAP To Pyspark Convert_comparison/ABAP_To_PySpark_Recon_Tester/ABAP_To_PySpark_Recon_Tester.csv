Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. This comparison framework is ready to process ABAP to PySpark conversion outputs once actual agent outputs are provided."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework established to compare ABAP to PySpark conversion logic, transformation accuracy, and business rule preservation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework established to compare code organization, function decomposition, and data flow patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Framework established to validate PySpark syntax, DataFrame operations, and SQL compliance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Framework established to validate PySpark syntax, DataFrame operations, and SQL compliance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure outputs contain complete ABAP to PySpark conversion code. 3. Include sample data transformations for validation. 4. Verify all DataFrame operations and SQL syntax before submission."
