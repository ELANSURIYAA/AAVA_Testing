Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents deliver comprehensive ABAP to PySpark migration validation scripts with robust error handling, logging, and reconciliation reporting. Agent 1 provides a class-based architecture with integrated pytest testing suite, while Agent 2 offers a production-ready approach with extensive configuration management and multiple storage backend support. Key differences include architectural patterns (class vs function-based), testing integration (embedded vs separate), and deployment readiness (development-focused vs production-optimized)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both outputs address the same core objective of ABAP to PySpark migration validation with nearly identical workflow steps: parsing ABAP/PySpark code, simulating ABAP execution, converting to Parquet, transferring to distributed storage, executing PySpark transformations, comparing results, and generating reconciliation reports. Minor semantic divergence in implementation approach - Agent 1 focuses on educational/development context with embedded testing, while Agent 2 emphasizes production deployment with enterprise configuration management."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 50-100, 150-200, 300-350","Structural differences are notable: Agent 1 uses object-oriented class-based design (ABAPtoPySparkMigrationValidator) with methods for each validation step, while Agent 2 employs functional programming with utility functions and a main() orchestrator. Both follow similar logical flow but Agent 1 includes integrated pytest test cases (lines 200-400), whereas Agent 2 separates concerns with extensive configuration management (lines 20-50). Control flow patterns differ but achieve equivalent outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 80, 120, 180","Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper Python imports, valid PySpark operations, correct pandas DataFrame handling, and well-formed pytest test cases. Minor issue: variable name '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s' appears to be a token placeholder (line 80) which should be sanitized. All class methods, exception handling, and Spark operations are syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,90,"Lines 45, 85, 150","Agent 2 shows strong syntax correctness with proper imports, valid environment variable usage, and correct PySpark DataFrame operations. Issues identified: undefined variable 'ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.csv' used as filename (line 85), and potential security risk with exec() function usage (line 150) despite namespace restrictions. Configuration management and error handling are syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both demonstrate high-quality Python syntax with proper exception handling, logging, and PySpark integration. Minor syntax issues in both outputs prevent perfect scores but do not compromise core functionality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Sanitize token placeholders and variable names (line 80). Consider separating pytest tests into dedicated test files for better maintainability. Add production deployment configuration similar to Agent 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Fix undefined variable 'ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.csv' (line 85) and implement safer code execution alternatives to exec() function (line 150). Consider adding integrated testing framework similar to Agent 1's pytest implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents would benefit from: 1) Enhanced data validation schemas, 2) Improved error recovery mechanisms, 3) Performance optimization for large datasets, 4) Integration with CI/CD pipelines, 5) Comprehensive documentation for deployment procedures."
