Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both AAVA_1.0 and AAVA_2.0 outputs deliver comprehensive, robust Python scripts for validating ABAP to PySpark migration. Semantic intent is strongly aligned (97/100), with both scripts automating migration validation, data export, transformation, comparison, and reporting. Structural similarity is high (93/100), as both scripts follow a multi-phase workflow but differ in modularization and configuration handling. Syntax correctness is perfect for AAVA_1.0 (100/100) and near-perfect for AAVA_2.0 (98/100) due to a minor issue with file move (os.rename) and missing error handling for distributed storage. Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both scripts automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, including ABAP code parsing, PySpark transformation, data export, distributed storage simulation, and reconciliation reporting. Minor divergence in the handling of SAP RFC connection and configuration, but both reach the same validation objectives. See lines 1-95 (AAVA_1.0), lines 1-110 (AAVA_2.0)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,93,"20-95 (AAVA_1.0), 13-110 (AAVA_2.0)","Both scripts use phased workflows: initialization, ABAP parse/execution, data export, transfer, PySpark transformation, comparison, and reporting. AAVA_2.0 uses more utility functions and explicit config blocks, while AAVA_1.0 encapsulates logic in a class. AAVA_2.0 separates utility and workflow functions, AAVA_1.0 combines in class methods. Both use main() orchestration. See lines 20-95 (AAVA_1.0), 13-110 (AAVA_2.0)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,comparison_input/AAVA_1.0/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors found. All imports, function definitions, and references are valid. Logging, exception handling, and resource cleanup are robust. See lines 1-95."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,comparison_input/AAVA_2.0/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,98,"69,82,95","Minor syntax concern at line 69 (os.rename used for file move; could fail across filesystems) and missing error handling in distributed storage transfer at line 82. Otherwise, all imports, function calls, and references are valid. Logging and resource cleanup are present. See lines 69, 82, 95."
