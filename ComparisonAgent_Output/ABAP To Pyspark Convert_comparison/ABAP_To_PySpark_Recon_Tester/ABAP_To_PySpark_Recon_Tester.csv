Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided. Input contained placeholder text '{{agent 1_string_true}}' and '{{agent 2_string_true}}' instead of actual agent outputs for ABAP to PySpark conversion comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Expected ABAP to PySpark conversion code or documentation for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze code structure, transformation logic, and PySpark DataFrame operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_Agent,0,N/A,"No ABAP conversion output provided for syntax validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,0,N/A,"No PySpark conversion output provided for syntax validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual outputs. Would validate ABAP syntax, PySpark DataFrame operations, and transformation logic."
