Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Input contains template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that have not been replaced with actual agent outputs. No substantive content available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables present instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables present instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 1 output - only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}} provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness of Agent 2 output - only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}} provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to absence of actual agent outputs to evaluate."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs instead of template variables to enable meaningful comparison analysis. Ensure {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} are replaced with real content before running comparison."
