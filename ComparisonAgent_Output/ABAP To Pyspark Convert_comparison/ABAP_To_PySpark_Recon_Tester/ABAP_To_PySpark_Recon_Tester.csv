Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. To conduct a meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions, actual content from both agents is required."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure both outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Include context about the task or instruction that generated these outputs. 4. Specify the expected output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test case) for appropriate validation criteria."
