Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation solutions with similar core functionality. Output 1 follows object-oriented design with extensive testing framework, while Output 2 uses functional approach with enterprise configuration management. Both implement the complete validation pipeline including ABAP execution simulation, Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark processing, and reconciliation reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs address identical migration validation goals with similar transformation logic (status column based on value > 1000, aggregation of total values). Core workflow steps are semantically equivalent: ABAP parsing, execution simulation, CSV-to-Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark DataFrame processing, and result comparison. Minor semantic differences in error handling approaches and configuration management patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Output 1 uses object-oriented class-based structure (ABAPtoPySparkMigrationValidator) with method decomposition, while Output 2 follows functional programming with utility functions and main workflow. Both maintain similar logical flow but different architectural patterns. Output 1 includes integrated pytest test suite (lines 200-350), while Output 2 separates configuration from execution logic (lines 25-50)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 89, 156, 234","Minor syntax issues: variable name '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s' appears to be a token placeholder (line 89), potential undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' used inconsistently throughout. Otherwise syntactically valid Python with proper imports, class structure, and method definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,92,"Lines 67, 158, 203","Syntax issues: undefined variable 'ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.csv' assignment (line 67), inconsistent variable naming 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' usage. Missing import for 'json' module despite usage in main function. Otherwise well-structured with proper exception handling and logging."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with minor variable naming and consistency issues. Both implement proper Python structure, imports, and error handling patterns suitable for enterprise deployment."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Resolve token placeholder variable names (line 89), standardize variable naming convention for 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' throughout codebase, consider extracting configuration parameters to separate config file for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Add missing 'json' import statement, fix undefined variable assignment (line 67), standardize variable naming patterns, consider adding integrated test suite similar to Output 1 for comprehensive validation coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both solutions are production-ready with minor syntax corrections. Output 1 provides better testing coverage while Output 2 offers superior configuration management. Consider hybrid approach combining Output 1's testing framework with Output 2's configuration structure for optimal enterprise deployment."
