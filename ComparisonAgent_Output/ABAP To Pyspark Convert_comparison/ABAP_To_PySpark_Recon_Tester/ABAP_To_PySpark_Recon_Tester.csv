Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison due to missing agent outputs. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were provided instead of actual content. This analysis framework is ready to evaluate ABAP to PySpark conversion outputs across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions once actual outputs are provided."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework would assess whether both agents understand ABAP to PySpark conversion requirements, apply similar transformation logic, and produce equivalent functional outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework would compare code organization, function decomposition, data flow patterns, and overall architectural approach between ABAP and PySpark implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual ABAP conversion output. Would check for valid PySpark syntax, proper DataFrame operations, correct function definitions, and absence of undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual PySpark conversion output. Would validate SQL syntax, DataFrame transformations, proper imports, and syntactic well-formedness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Overall correctness score would be calculated as average of individual agent correctness scores once actual outputs are provided."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables to enable comprehensive comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Ensure agent outputs include complete ABAP to PySpark conversion code with proper syntax and structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Include line numbers in agent outputs to enable precise reference tracking during comparison."
