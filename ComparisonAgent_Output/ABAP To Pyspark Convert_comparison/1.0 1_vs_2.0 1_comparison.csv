Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs automate and validate ABAP to PySpark migration, offering robust reconciliation, error handling, and reporting. Semantic intent is highly aligned (97/100), with minor emphasis differences in distributed storage and configuration. Structure is nearly identical (95/100), but 2.0 1 emphasizes environment/config setup and more flexible storage handling (see lines 21-57, 63-84). Syntax correctness is perfect in both outputs (100/100). Overall score: 97/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both outputs achieve the same goal: automating validation of ABAP to PySpark migration, simulating ABAP execution, converting outputs, reconciling results, and generating reports. 2.0 1 adds explicit distributed storage configuration and broader compatibility (S3/HDFS/Local), whereas 1.0 1 focuses on local simulation and includes more explicit pytest coverage. Minor differences in approach, but core meaning and intent are aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"21-57, 63-84","Both scripts follow a similar stepwise workflow: input parsing, simulated/executed ABAP, output conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark processing, result comparison, and report generation. 2.0 1 adds configuration sections (lines 21-57), utility functions (lines 63-84), and more explicit modularization, whereas 1.0 1 embeds these within class methods. Both provide detailed logging and error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"1.0 1 output is syntactically valid Python, with correct use of imports, classes, and functions. No undefined variables, broken references, or formatting errors detected. Includes a valid pytest suite."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,100,,"2.0 1 output is syntactically valid Python with correct function and workflow definitions, robust error handling, and clear modularization. No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 1.0 1 (100) and 2.0 1 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"21-57, 63-84","Consider adopting 2.0 1's explicit environment/configuration setup and flexible distributed storage handling (lines 21-57, 63-84) in 1.0 1 for improved adaptability and integration."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,,"pytest block","Consider integrating 1.0 1's more explicit pytest test coverage into 2.0 1 for enhanced transformation scenario validation."
