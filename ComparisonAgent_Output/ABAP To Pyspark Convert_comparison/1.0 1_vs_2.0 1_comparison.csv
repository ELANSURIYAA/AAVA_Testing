Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,94,,"Both 1.0 1 and 2.0 1 outputs implement an ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation script, covering the end-to-end workflow, including parsing, simulated execution, transformation, comparison, and reporting. Semantic intent is highly aligned with minor differences in emphasis and implementation. Structural similarity is strong, with both scripts following a modular workflow but differing in error handling, configuration, and external integration. Syntax correctness is perfect for both agents, with no errors detected in either output. Overall score: 94/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"1-282 (1.0 1), 1-197 (2.0 1)","Both outputs automate ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation, including parsing, simulation, transformation, comparison, and reporting. 1.0 1 emphasizes stepwise orchestration and test coverage, while 2.0 1 highlights configuration, external integration, and schema validation. Minor divergence in error handling and emphasis, but core goals and logic are matched."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"1-282 (1.0 1), 1-197 (2.0 1)","Both outputs are modular scripts with main workflow functions, logging, and reporting. 1.0 1 is class-based with explicit orchestration, while 2.0 1 is more procedural, leveraging configuration blocks and utility functions. 2.0 1 includes detailed config and external connection setup, while 1.0 1 provides embedded pytest coverage. The overall workflow steps (parse, simulate, transform, compare, report) are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected in 1.0 1 (lines 1-282). All imports and class/method definitions are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,100,,"No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected in 2.0 1 (lines 1-197). All imports, function definitions, and main workflow are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Average of 1.0 1 (100) and 2.0 1 (100)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"1-197","Consider adding explicit test coverage (as in 1.0 1 lines 215-282) to ensure transformation logic is robust across edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,"1-282","Consider adopting more flexible configuration and external connection handling (as in 2.0 1 lines 15-62) for production-readiness."
