Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt outputs deliver robust ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation workflows. Semantic similarity is very high (97/100) with minor divergence in simulated vs. real SAP integration. Structural similarity is strong (95/100), with 2.0 1 using more modular config and utility functions, while 1.0 1 embeds most logic in a class. Syntax correctness is perfect for both (100/100) – both scripts are internally consistent, import required modules, and contain no syntax errors. Overall score: 97/100."
