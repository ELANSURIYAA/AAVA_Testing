Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,93,,"Both '1.0 1' and '2.0 1' outputs implement comprehensive ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation scripts, covering simulation of ABAP execution, data export to Parquet, distributed storage transfer, PySpark execution, and reconciliation reporting. Semantic and structural alignment is high, though '2.0 1' includes more explicit configuration and SAP RFC hooks, while '1.0 1' includes an embedded pytest test suite. Minor structural and stylistic differences exist. Syntax correctness is perfect for both. Overall score: 93/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs automate validation for ABAP-to-PySpark migration, covering: parsing ABAP and PySpark code, simulating/executing ABAP, exporting to Parquet, transferring to storage, running PySpark transformation, and reporting reconciliation. Both check row/column match, compute match percentage, and generate JSON reports. '2.0 1' provides more explicit configuration for SAP and storage, while '1.0 1' embeds more transformation logic and test cases. Intent, coverage, and outcomes are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"1-50, 51-300 (1.0 1); 1-100, 101-300 (2.0 1)","Major workflow steps are aligned: initialization, ABAP/PySpark code parsing, simulated/executed ABAP, data export, storage transfer, PySpark transformation, result comparison, and reporting. '2.0 1' structures configuration and logging more explicitly, and handles SAP/HDFS/S3/LOCAL via config; '1.0 1' is more monolithic but includes an embedded pytest suite (lines 301+). Minor differences in function decomposition and explicit error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1,100,,"No syntax errors found in '1.0 1' (lines 1-388). All imports, class methods, and test functions are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1,100,,"No syntax errors found in '2.0 1' (lines 1-230). All imports, function definitions, logging, and main entry point are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct. Average correctness: 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1,"301+","Consider including an embedded test suite (as in '1.0 1', lines 301+) to improve automated validation coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1,"1-50","Consider refactoring configuration and storage handling to be more modular and environment-driven, as in '2.0 1' (lines 1-50)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,all,"Both scripts are robust, but ensure all simulated steps (ABAP execution, storage transfer) are replaced with real implementations for production."
