Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,95,,"Both 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt and 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt outputs address the same migration validation workflow, including ABAP and PySpark code parsing, simulation/execution, data export, external table creation, transformation, and reconciliation reporting. Semantic and structural alignment are very high, with minor differences in implementation details and emphasis (e.g., credential handling, connection simulation, and test scaffolding). Both scripts are syntactically correct, but 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt references some integration points not fully implemented in the script body. Overall, both solutions are robust and audit-ready, with an overall score of 95/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,97,,"Both scripts implement an ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation pipeline, covering all major steps: ABAP code parsing/execution, PySpark transformation, export/import, distributed storage simulation, and reconciliation reporting. Both include error handling and logging. Minor differences: 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt provides an explicit pytest suite, while 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt embeds more credential and distributed system config, but omits test scaffolding. Both reach the same end-goal."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,93,"1-~100, ~100-~230","Both outputs follow the same logical pipeline (parse ABAP, parse PySpark, simulate/execute, export, transfer, load in Spark, transform, compare, report). 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt puts more emphasis on config and runtime environment, and its function breakdown is slightly flatter, whereas 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt uses a class-based structure with more encapsulation and includes a dedicated pytest section. Minor order/structure differences, but all major blocks are present in both."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax errors detected; all imports, function/class definitions, and docstrings are valid. The pytest script is well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,95,"~25, ~70, ~120","Syntax is valid, but some code sections (e.g., SAP RFC and S3 integration) are referenced in config and comments but not fully implemented (e.g., missing actual HDFS/S3 logic, placeholder for exec-based PySpark execution). These are documented as 'not implemented here', which is acceptable for a template, but slightly reduces completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of 100 (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt) and 95 (2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"~25, ~70, ~120","Implement the referenced distributed storage (S3/HDFS) and SAP RFC integration logic for full end-to-end automation. Replace placeholders with actual code if possible."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,"~120","Add test scaffolding (such as the pytest suite present in 1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt) for transformation logic validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,"~100-~230","Consider parameterizing configuration (storage paths, credentials) as in 2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt for improved deployment flexibility."
