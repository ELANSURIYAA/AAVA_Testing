Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for DB2 to Oracle Exadata migration. Agent_1_Migration_Doc presents a more detailed breakdown with specific hourly rates and multiple execution scenarios, while Agent_2_Migration_Doc offers more conservative estimates with clearer assumptions. Key differences include runtime estimates (1-2 hours vs 15 minutes), total effort estimates (50-65 hours vs 12-18 hours), and cost calculation approaches. Both outputs are well-structured and address the core requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for DB2 to Oracle migration. They cover identical key areas: Oracle Exadata runtime costs, manual code fixes, and data reconciliation testing. However, Agent_1_Migration_Doc assumes longer execution times and higher effort estimates, while Agent_2_Migration_Doc provides more conservative estimates with detailed per-run cost breakdowns. The semantic intent is highly aligned despite different quantitative assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Cost Estimation section with Oracle Exadata runtime costs, 2) Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort section. Both use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) and include assumptions/reasoning subsections. Agent_2_Migration_Doc adds a summary table and more detailed breakdown of manual fixes, but the overall logical flow and decomposition approach are very similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Migration_Doc,95,Lines 15-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent numbering, and well-formed cost calculations. Minor issue: some assumptions could be more explicitly stated (e.g., single vs multi-node deployment assumptions)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Migration_Doc,98,Lines 20-35,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structure, and clear mathematical calculations. All references are properly formatted and assumptions are explicitly stated."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_2_Migration_Doc slightly edges out with more explicit assumption documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Migration_Doc,N/A,Lines 30-40,"Consider providing more conservative runtime estimates and adding detailed per-run cost breakdowns similar to Agent_2_Migration_Doc. Include explicit assumptions about node configuration and deployment scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Migration_Doc,N/A,Lines 25-45,"Excellent approach with conservative estimates and clear documentation. Consider adding scenarios for different data volumes and complexity levels to provide more comprehensive guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Including sensitivity analysis for different data volumes, 2) Adding risk factors and mitigation strategies, 3) Providing ranges rather than point estimates for better decision-making support."
