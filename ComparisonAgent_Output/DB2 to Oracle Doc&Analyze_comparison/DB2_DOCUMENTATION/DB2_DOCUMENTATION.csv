Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two comprehensive DB2 database documentation approaches analyzed. Agent_1 provides business-focused documentation with derived metrics and Oracle migration recommendations. Agent_2 delivers formal database schema documentation with detailed technical specifications. Both address the same core sales performance database but with different documentation philosophies and target audiences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Agent_1: Lines 1-150, Agent_2: Lines 1-200","Both documents address the same DB2 sales performance database with customer_master and sales_transactions tables. Agent_1 focuses on analytical views and business metrics while Agent_2 emphasizes technical schema details. Key difference: Agent_2 introduces product_master table (lines 95-110) not present in Agent_1. Both cover customer segmentation and sales analysis but with different emphases - Agent_1 on derived business metrics, Agent_2 on database structure."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Agent_1: Lines 1-20, 25-45, 80-120, Agent_2: Lines 1-15, 20-40, 50-180","Fundamentally different documentation structures. Agent_1 uses business-oriented sections: Database Overview, Schema Details, Views/Derived Metrics, Challenges/Recommendations. Agent_2 follows formal database documentation template: Table of Contents, Database Overview, Schema with detailed table specifications, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, Appendices. Agent_1 emphasizes analytical capabilities while Agent_2 focuses on technical specifications and relationships."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15, 45, 120","Well-structured markdown with proper table formatting and clear section organization. Minor issues: Some table formatting could be more consistent (line 45), and Oracle migration recommendations could be more specific (line 120). Overall syntax is correct and content is logically organized."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 50-60, 150","Excellent formal database documentation structure with proper markdown formatting, consistent table layouts, and comprehensive technical details. Very minor formatting inconsistency in constraint descriptions (lines 50-60). Documentation follows professional database documentation standards effectively."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both documents demonstrate high syntactic correctness. Agent_2 slightly superior in formal documentation standards and consistency. Agent_1 effective for business audience with minor formatting variations."
