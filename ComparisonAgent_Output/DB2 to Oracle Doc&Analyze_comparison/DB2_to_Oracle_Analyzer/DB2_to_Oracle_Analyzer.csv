Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-187 vs 1-109,"Both outputs provide comprehensive DB2 to Oracle conversion analysis reports. DB2 to Oracle Doc delivers a structured metrics report with 187 lines analyzing customer/sales data processing, while Analyze provides a 109-line session analysis focusing on customer segmentation and performance analytics. Both identify similar complexity scores (70/100 vs 38/100) and recommend refactoring over rebuilding, with identical API costs of 0.0437 USD."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10 vs 1-15","Both outputs address DB2 to Oracle conversion analysis with similar intent and scope. DB2 to Oracle Doc focuses on comprehensive data analysis query conversion while Analyze emphasizes customer segmentation analytics. Both identify syntax differences (DAYS, NULLIF, window functions) and recommend similar optimization strategies. Minor divergence in complexity scoring methodology but aligned conversion approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 11-50 vs 16-45","Both follow similar analytical structure: Overview → Complexity Metrics → Syntax Differences → Manual Adjustments → Conversion Complexity → Optimization → API Cost. DB2 to Oracle Doc uses more detailed tabular format while Analyze uses mixed table/narrative approach. Both employ systematic metric categorization but with different organizational emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2 to Oracle Doc,95,"Lines 51-70, 85-95","Well-formed analysis with consistent metric calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in table alignment at lines 51-70. All technical references are accurate and properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Analyze,92,"Lines 46-60, 75-85","Comprehensive technical analysis with accurate syntax identification. Minor inconsistency in CTE counting methodology at lines 46-60. Window function analysis is thorough and correctly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting and methodological inconsistencies. Technical accuracy is maintained throughout both analyses."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DB2 to Oracle Doc,,Lines 140-160,"Strengthen structural consistency in tabular formatting. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology to align with industry benchmarks. Enhance cross-referencing between sections for better flow."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Analyze,,Lines 90-105,"Improve CTE counting methodology consistency. Consider expanding on optimization techniques section with more Oracle Exadata-specific recommendations. Enhance session analysis integration with main conversion metrics."
