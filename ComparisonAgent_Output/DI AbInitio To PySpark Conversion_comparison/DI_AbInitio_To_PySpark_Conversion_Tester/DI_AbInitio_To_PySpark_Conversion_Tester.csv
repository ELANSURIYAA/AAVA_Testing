Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Both agents produced comprehensive test validation suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion with test case documents and pytest implementations. Agent 1 uses mock transformation functions while Agent 2 imports actual conversion modules. Both cover essential testing scenarios including joins, null handling, error cases, and edge conditions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Both outputs address the same core goal of validating Ab Initio to PySpark conversions. Test case descriptions are highly similar (TC001-TC005 nearly identical). Agent 1 focuses on generic transformation testing while Agent 2 targets specific conversion modules. Minor differences in test case priorities (Agent 1: TC006 data type mismatch vs Agent 2: TC006 deduplication)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-15, 30-200","Both follow identical document structure: header comment, test case table, pytest script, API cost. Test case tables use same format and numbering. Pytest scripts follow same pattern with fixtures, imports, and test functions. Agent 2 has more specific imports and schema references while Agent 1 uses generic mock functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 50-60, 150-160","Minor syntax issues: Line 58 has potential undefined variable reference in mock function. Line 156 test_TC006_data_type_mismatch expects Exception but may be too generic. Overall structure and pytest syntax are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 40-50, 120-130","Line 45 missing schema1 definition before first usage in test_TC002. Line 125 schema_unordered test may not properly validate field order handling. Import statements assume modules exist but are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score. Both outputs have minor syntax/reference issues but maintain overall structural integrity and proper pytest formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 50-60","Improve mock function implementation to avoid undefined variable references. Make exception handling more specific in test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 40-50","Define schema1 before first usage. Verify all imported modules exist. Add more explicit error handling in boundary value tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both agents should include more detailed documentation of business rules being tested. Consider adding performance benchmarks and data volume testing scenarios."
