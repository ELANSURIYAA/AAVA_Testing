Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content. This prevents semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables indicate missing input data."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No content available for structural analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness for Agent 1 due to missing output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness for Agent 2 due to missing output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent outputs are properly provided before running comparison analysis. 2. Verify that placeholder variables are replaced with actual content. 3. Re-run analysis once valid agent outputs are available. 4. Consider implementing input validation to catch missing content early in the process."
