Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion validation. Agent 1 uses mock transformation functions while Agent 2 imports actual conversion modules. Both cover essential test scenarios including joins, null handling, reject logic, and edge cases. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment with minor structural differences in implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core goal of validating Ab Initio to PySpark conversions. They cover identical test scenarios (TC001-TC010) with similar expected behaviors. The main semantic difference is Agent 1 uses mock functions while Agent 2 uses actual imported modules. Both handle joins, nulls, rejects, lookups, empty inputs, data type issues, deduplication, and boundary conditions with aligned intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both outputs follow similar overall structure with test case tables and pytest implementations. However, Agent 1 uses a single mock transformation function throughout, while Agent 2 imports multiple specific transformation functions and schemas from separate modules. Agent 2 includes more detailed schema definitions and uses actual module imports (lines 15-25), showing more production-ready structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15, 45, 78, 123","Agent 1 has valid Python syntax throughout. Minor issues: Line 15 mock function could have more robust error handling, Line 45 filter logic assumes amount column exists without validation, Line 78 exception handling is generic, Line 123 column reordering logic could be more defensive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 16-25, 67, 89, 145","Agent 2 has valid Python syntax but some potential issues: Lines 16-25 import statements reference modules that may not exist in test environment, Line 67 undefined schema1 variable used, Line 89 transformation function call without proper error handling, Line 145 missing import for date module despite usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate solid Python and pytest syntax with minor issues that could impact execution in real environments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,,"Agent 1 should enhance mock function robustness, add proper column existence validation before filtering, implement specific exception types instead of generic Exception handling, and add defensive programming for column reordering operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,,"Agent 2 should ensure all imported modules exist in test environment, define schema1 variable before usage, add proper error handling for transformation function calls, and include necessary imports (datetime) for all used modules."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both agents should standardize on either mock or actual function approach for consistency, add more comprehensive error messages for failed assertions, include performance benchmarks for large dataset testing, and consider parameterized tests for better coverage of edge cases."
