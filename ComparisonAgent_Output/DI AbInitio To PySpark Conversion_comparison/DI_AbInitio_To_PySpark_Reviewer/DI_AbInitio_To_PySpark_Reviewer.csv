Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"No agent outputs provided for comparison. Unable to perform semantic, structural, or correctness analysis without actual content from both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as no agent outputs were provided in the input placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare logical flow and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"No Agent 1 output provided for syntax-level correctness validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"No Agent 2 output provided for syntax-level correctness validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 1: Provide actual agent outputs in the input placeholders for meaningful comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 2: Ensure both agent outputs are complete and properly formatted before initiating comparison process."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 3: Verify that the comparison task includes sufficient context and requirements for evaluation."
