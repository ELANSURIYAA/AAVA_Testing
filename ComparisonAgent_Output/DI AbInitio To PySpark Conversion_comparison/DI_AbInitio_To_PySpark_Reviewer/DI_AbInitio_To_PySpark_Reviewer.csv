Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+ (both outputs)","Both outputs provide comprehensive Ab Initio to PySpark conversion validation reports with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (85/100). Agent 1 achieves 98% conversion accuracy while Agent 2 reports 95%. Both identify similar manual intervention requirements and optimization opportunities. Key differences lie in presentation format and specific validation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 150-200","Both outputs address identical core objectives: validating Ab Initio to PySpark conversion accuracy. They cover the same validation dimensions (flow order, XFR placement, schema mapping, syntax review) and reach similar conclusions about conversion quality. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on reconciliation/orchestration (lines 180-190), while Agent 2 emphasizes component-by-component validation tables (lines 20-80). Both identify error/reject handling as primary manual intervention requirement."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 10-30, 60-100, 140-170","Agent 1 uses numbered sections with emoji headers and bullet-point validation results. Agent 2 employs table-based component mapping with structured validation columns. Both follow logical flow: input analysis → component validation → syntax review → manual interventions → summary. Agent 1 includes additional orchestration section (lines 180-190) not present in Agent 2. Different organizational approaches but equivalent coverage depth."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 1-200","Syntactically correct throughout. All sections properly formatted with consistent emoji usage and bullet points. No broken references or undefined terms. Comprehensive coverage of all validation aspects. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 45 with mixed bullet styles, but does not impact readability or accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-180","Generally well-structured with proper markdown table formatting. Some inconsistencies in table alignment (lines 25-30, 70-75). All component mappings are accurate and complete. Minor issue with incomplete sentence in line 165 ('If you need the full code...' appears truncated). Overall syntax and structure are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores (98+95)/2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 150-170","Maintain comprehensive validation approach with clear emoji-based section headers. Consider standardizing bullet point formatting for consistency. Excellent coverage of orchestration and reconciliation aspects should be preserved in future reports."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 20-80, 160-180","Table-based component validation provides excellent clarity and should be maintained. Address table formatting inconsistencies and ensure all concluding statements are complete. Consider adding orchestration validation section similar to Agent 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both approaches have merit - Agent 1's narrative style with Agent 2's tabular validation would create optimal hybrid approach. Both correctly identify manual intervention requirements and provide actionable recommendations for production deployment."
