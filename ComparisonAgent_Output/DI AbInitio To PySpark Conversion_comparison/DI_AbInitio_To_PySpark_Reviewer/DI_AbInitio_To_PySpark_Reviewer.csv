Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents produced comprehensive validation reports for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. Agent 1 achieved 98% conversion accuracy with high confidence while Agent 2 achieved 95% accuracy. Both identified similar manual intervention requirements including error/reject handling and join logic implementation. The reports show strong alignment in validation methodology and findings."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1) Lines 1-80 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core goal of validating Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. They apply similar validation methodologies including flow validation XFR function placement schema validation and syntax review. Key semantic alignment includes: (1) Both identify error/reject handling as manual intervention (Agent 1 line 45 Agent 2 line 65) (2) Both validate component coverage and flow order preservation (3) Both provide confidence scores and conversion accuracy percentages. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on test coverage while Agent 2 provides detailed component-by-component mapping tables."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 10-40 (Agent 1) Lines 15-70 (Agent 2)","Both reports follow similar logical structure with validation sections but differ in presentation format. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-9) with emoji indicators and structured checks while Agent 2 uses markdown tables and component mapping. Common structural elements: (1) Flow & Order Validation sections (2) XFR Function Placement analysis (3) SQL & Column Validations (4) Component Coverage assessment (5) Syntax Review (6) Manual Intervention identification (7) Overall Summary with numerical scores. Agent 2 provides more granular component-by-component tables while Agent 1 uses more narrative structure with specific check results."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 5-10 25-30 45-50","Agent 1 report has excellent syntax and structure. Minor issues: (1) Line 8 - inconsistent file path format in validation report header (2) Line 28 - some bullet points use mixed emoji/text formatting that could be standardized (3) Line 47 - ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt appears to be a formatting artifact. Overall well-structured with clear sections and consistent validation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-5 15-20","Agent 2 report demonstrates superior formatting consistency and structure. Excellent use of markdown tables for component mapping. Minor issues: (1) Line 3 - file names could be more descriptive than tmp references (2) Line 18 - one table cell alignment could be improved. Otherwise syntactically excellent with clear headers consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both reports demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper structure and formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 45-50","Standardize formatting consistency particularly emoji usage and bullet point styles. Consider adding more granular component mapping tables similar to Agent 2 approach for enhanced clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 1-5","Replace temporary file references with more descriptive identifiers. Consider adding test coverage analysis section to match Agent 1 comprehensive approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All sections","Both reports provide excellent validation coverage. Consider combining Agent 1 test coverage depth with Agent 2 component mapping granularity for optimal validation reporting. Both correctly identify manual intervention requirements and provide actionable recommendations."
