Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided in the input. Only placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) was received instead of the actual content to be compared."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform proper comparison analysis: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text, 2) Ensure outputs contain the DI AbInitio to PySpark conversion content, 3) Include proper formatting and structure for meaningful comparison."
