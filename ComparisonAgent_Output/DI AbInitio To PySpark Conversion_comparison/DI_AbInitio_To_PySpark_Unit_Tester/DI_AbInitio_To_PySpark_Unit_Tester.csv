Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. First_Output provides a complete, well-structured test suite with 10 test cases and full implementations. Second_Output appears incomplete with truncated content and missing test implementations. Semantic similarity is moderate due to shared purpose but different test case focus. Structural similarity is low due to incomplete second output. Correctness varies significantly between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs address unit testing for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion with similar overall intent. First_Output focuses on comprehensive testing including lookups, joins, and business rules. Second_Output emphasizes different test scenarios like deduplication and boundary values. Core purpose alignment is strong but specific test focus differs moderately."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case inventory tables and pytest templates. However, Second_Output is severely truncated at line 147, missing complete test implementations. First_Output has complete 10 test functions while Second_Output only shows partial structure. Organizational approach is similar but execution completeness differs drastically."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,95,Lines 45-47,"Syntactically correct Python code with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor issue: Line 45-47 shows inconsistent schema field ordering in some test cases but doesn't break functionality. All pytest syntax is valid and chispa assertions are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,25,Lines 147-end,"Severely incomplete with truncated content starting at line 147. The visible portion shows correct Python syntax and proper imports, but the incomplete test data structure and missing test implementations make this largely non-functional. Missing closing brackets and incomplete data structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,60,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 25) / 2 = 60. Significant disparity due to Second_Output incompleteness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,N/A,N/A,"Excellent foundation with comprehensive test coverage. Consider adding more edge cases for data type validation and improving schema consistency across test cases. Add parameterized tests for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,N/A,Lines 147-end,"Critical: Complete the truncated implementation. Add missing test function bodies, fix incomplete data structures, and ensure all imports are properly defined. The test case inventory shows good planning but needs full implementation to be functional."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Standardize test case naming conventions and ensure consistent schema definitions across both implementations. Consider merging the best aspects: First_Output's completeness with Second_Output's additional test scenarios like boundary value testing."
