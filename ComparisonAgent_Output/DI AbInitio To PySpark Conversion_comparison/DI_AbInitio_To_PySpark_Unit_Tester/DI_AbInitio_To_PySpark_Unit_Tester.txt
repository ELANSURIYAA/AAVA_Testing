# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Comparison of two Ab Initio to PySpark unit test suites from Ascendion AVA+. Agent_1 provides a complete, comprehensive test framework with 10 detailed test cases covering happy path, edge cases, and negative scenarios. Agent_2 follows identical structural approach but appears incomplete with truncated content. Both target the same transformation function and use similar pytest patterns with chispa for DataFrame comparison.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address identical semantic goals: creating comprehensive unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. They target the same transformation function (`transform_iods_cons_csv_dntl_clmdtl_hx_br1_v353s6p2`), use identical test case categorization (Happy Path, Edge Case, Negative Test), and implement the same testing philosophy with PySpark DataFrames and chispa assertions. The semantic intent and purpose are nearly identical.

**Key Similarities:**
- Same transformation function targeting
- Identical test categorization approach
- Same testing framework (pytest + chispa)
- Similar business logic coverage (NULL handling, lookups, deduplication)

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Structural organization is virtually identical: both start with header comments, followed by test case inventory tables with same columns (Test Case ID, Description, Scenario Type, Expected Outcome), then pytest script templates. Both use the same fixture pattern (`@pytest.fixture` for SparkSession), identical import structure, and same test function naming conventions (`test_TC001_`, `test_TC002_`, etc.). The logical flow and decomposition approach are essentially the same.

**Structural Elements:**
- Header documentation format
- Test case inventory table structure
- Pytest fixture patterns
- Import organization
- Test function naming conventions

### Correctness

**Agent_1: 100/100**
Agent_1 provides syntactically correct and complete pytest code. All imports are properly structured, test functions are well-formed with proper assertions, DataFrame schemas are correctly defined, and the code follows Python/pytest best practices. No syntax errors or structural issues detected.

**Agent_2: 45/100**
Agent_2 appears incomplete with truncated content (lines 150+). The output cuts off mid-sentence in the test data definition with incomplete tuple and missing closing elements. The visible portions are syntactically correct, but the incomplete nature significantly impacts overall correctness.

**Overall Correctness: 73/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 45 | 73 |
| **Overall** | **98** | **79** | **89** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:**
Agent_1 delivers excellent quality with comprehensive test coverage, proper error handling scenarios, and complete implementation. Recommend using as the primary reference for unit test implementation.

**For Agent_2:**
Agent_2 requires completion of the truncated content (lines 150+). The visible structure and approach are sound, but the incomplete test data definitions need to be finished. Recommend completing the missing portions and ensuring all test cases are fully implemented.

**For Both Agents:**
Both agents demonstrate strong understanding of PySpark testing patterns. Consider combining Agent_1's completeness with any unique test scenarios from Agent_2 once completed. Both could benefit from additional edge cases like schema evolution, partition handling, and performance validation.
