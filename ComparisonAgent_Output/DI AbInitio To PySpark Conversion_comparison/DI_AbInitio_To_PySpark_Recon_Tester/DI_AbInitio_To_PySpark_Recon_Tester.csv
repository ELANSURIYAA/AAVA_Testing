Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-400,"Both outputs are comprehensive Python orchestration scripts for AbInitio to PySpark migration validation on GCP. They share the same core objective of running AbInitio graphs, executing PySpark jobs on Dataproc, performing reconciliation, and generating reports. However, they differ significantly in implementation approach, error handling robustness, and code organization. The first script is more comprehensive with better error handling and structured logging, while the second script has some implementation issues including incomplete reconciliation script and excessive GCS configuration."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-400,"Both scripts address the identical migration validation workflow: 1) Execute AbInitio graph on GCP VM, 2) Submit PySpark job to Dataproc, 3) Run reconciliation comparison, 4) Generate structured reports. Core business logic and intent are highly aligned. Both use similar GCP services (Dataproc, GCS, Compute Engine) and follow the same high-level orchestration pattern. Minor semantic differences exist in configuration management approaches and output formatting preferences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-400,"Both scripts follow similar structural patterns with configuration sections, utility functions, and main orchestration logic. Key structural similarities include: environment variable configuration (lines 25-35 in both), GCP client initialization, sequential execution flow, and error handling patterns. However, structural differences include: first script uses more modular function organization with cleaner separation of concerns, second script has more inline configuration and less structured error handling. The first script has better code organization with distinct phases, while the second has more procedural flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Script,90,1-200,"First script demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, valid imports, correct function definitions, and proper exception handling. All variable references are properly defined, GCP API calls follow correct patterns, and subprocess commands are well-formed. Minor issues include potential undefined variables in some edge cases and missing import for uuid module validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Script,65,201-400,"Second script has several syntactic and structural issues: 1) Incomplete reconciliation PySpark script with malformed string literals and excessive repetitive GCS configuration (lines 350-400), 2) Missing proper error handling in several functions, 3) Inconsistent variable naming and potential undefined references, 4) The reconciliation script contains syntax errors with unclosed parentheses and malformed configuration blocks. These issues would prevent successful execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,78,,"Average correctness score reflecting significant disparity between the two scripts. First script is production-ready with minor refinements needed, while second script requires substantial debugging and cleanup before deployment."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Script,,1-200,"Recommended for production use with minor enhancements: 1) Add comprehensive input validation for all environment variables, 2) Implement retry mechanisms for GCP API calls, 3) Add more granular logging for debugging, 4) Consider adding configuration file support as alternative to environment variables, 5) Implement proper cleanup procedures for failed executions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Script,,201-400,"Requires significant refactoring before production use: 1) Fix syntax errors in reconciliation script (lines 350-400), 2) Remove excessive and redundant GCS configuration, 3) Implement proper error handling throughout, 4) Standardize variable naming conventions, 5) Add comprehensive testing and validation, 6) Restructure code for better maintainability and readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-400,"For both scripts: 1) Implement comprehensive integration testing with mock GCP services, 2) Add configuration validation and environment setup verification, 3) Consider implementing parallel execution capabilities for large-scale migrations, 4) Add support for incremental migration validation, 5) Implement detailed audit logging for compliance requirements."
