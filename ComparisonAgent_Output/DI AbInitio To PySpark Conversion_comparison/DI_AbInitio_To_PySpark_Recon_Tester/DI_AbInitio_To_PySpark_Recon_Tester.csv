Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive AbInitio to PySpark migration validation orchestration scripts for GCP. Agent_1_Migration_Validation demonstrates superior code quality with robust error handling, modular design, and clean implementation. Agent_2_Migration_Validation shares the same core functionality but suffers from significant code quality issues, particularly in the embedded reconciliation script section with malformed configuration statements and excessive redundancy."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both scripts address identical migration validation requirements with same core workflow: AbInitio execution, PySpark job submission, and reconciliation reporting. Minor semantic divergence in error handling approaches and reconciliation detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 25-75, 125-175","Similar high-level structure with configuration, utilities, and orchestration phases. Agent_1_Migration_Validation shows better modular decomposition while Agent_2_Migration_Validation has structural bloat in reconciliation section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Migration_Validation,92,"Lines 45, 67, 89","Well-formed Python with proper imports, exception handling, and GCP API integration. Minor issues with some environment variable validation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Migration_Validation,45,"Lines 200-400+","Significant syntax errors in embedded reconciliation script with incomplete configuration statements, malformed method calls, and excessive redundant GCS configuration blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,69,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (92 + 45) / 2 = 68.5, rounded to 69"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Migration_Validation,,"Excellent foundation with minor improvements needed: Add more comprehensive input validation, enhance logging granularity, and consider adding retry mechanisms for GCP operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Migration_Validation,,"Requires significant refactoring: Fix syntax errors in reconciliation script (lines 200+), remove redundant GCS configuration blocks, implement proper error handling, and modularize the embedded script logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents would benefit from: Enhanced documentation, standardized configuration management, improved test coverage, and integration with CI/CD pipeline templates."
