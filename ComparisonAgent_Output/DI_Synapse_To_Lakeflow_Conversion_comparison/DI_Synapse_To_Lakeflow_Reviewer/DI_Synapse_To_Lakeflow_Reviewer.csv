Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs are comprehensive technical reviews of Synapse to Databricks Lakeflow conversion projects. They follow identical structural patterns with sections for Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Optimization Suggestions, and API Cost Estimation. The semantic similarity is high (85/100) as both address the same type of conversion analysis, though they reference different source procedures. Structural similarity is very high (95/100) with nearly identical organization and flow. Correctness shows some inconsistency in Agent 2 regarding procedure naming (90/100 average)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-10,"Both outputs address Synapse to Databricks Lakeflow conversion reviews with similar intent and methodology. However, Agent 1 focuses on LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY while Agent 2 mentions Load_HoldingsFact.txt in the description but discusses LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY in content. This creates some semantic confusion but overall purpose alignment remains strong."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) Summary section providing overview, (2) Conversion Accuracy section detailing mapping and transformations, (3) Optimization Suggestions with performance and operational improvements, (4) API Cost Estimation. The logical flow, section headers, and content decomposition are remarkably consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_Reviewer,95,Lines 1-50,"Output is well-structured with consistent internal references. All sections are properly formatted and content flows logically. Minor deduction for some generic optimization suggestions that could be more specific to the actual procedure being reviewed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Load_HoldingsFact_Reviewer,85,Lines 1-10,"Output structure is sound but contains inconsistency between the described filename 'Load_HoldingsFact.txt' in the header and the actual procedure 'LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY' discussed throughout the content. This creates confusion about which procedure is actually being reviewed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score reflecting good structural integrity with some inconsistencies in Agent 2's procedure naming and referencing."

Recommendations,Recommendation,LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_Reviewer,,Lines 20-40,"Enhance optimization suggestions with more procedure-specific recommendations. Consider adding quantitative metrics for performance improvements and more detailed cost-benefit analysis of suggested optimizations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Load_HoldingsFact_Reviewer,,Lines 1-10,"Resolve the inconsistency between the filename reference and actual procedure being reviewed. Ensure all references throughout the document align with the correct procedure name to avoid confusion for stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs would benefit from more specific technical details about the conversion process, including actual code snippets or configuration examples. Consider adding validation test results or performance benchmarks to support the conversion accuracy claims."
