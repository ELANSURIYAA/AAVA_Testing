Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 (Agent1), Lines 1-7 (Agent2)","Both agents analyze the same core challenge: lack of direct access to converted Lakeflow notebook code for test case design. Both conclude they can proceed using context-provided pipeline information. Agent2 provides more detailed analysis and specific file references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-7","Both agents identify the same core problem (missing actual notebook code) and reach the same conclusion (proceed with context information). Agent2 provides more detailed reasoning and specific file analysis, but the fundamental semantic intent is identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-7","Agent1 uses a more direct, concise structure (problem→solution→action). Agent2 follows a more analytical structure (problem→detailed analysis→evidence evaluation→conclusion→action). Both follow logical progression but with different levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 1-3","Syntactically correct, well-formed sentences, proper logical flow. Minor deduction for less comprehensive analysis compared to the thoroughness expected for such technical decisions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,100,"Lines 1-7","Syntactically perfect, comprehensive analysis with specific file references, proper technical terminology, and thorough logical reasoning. Demonstrates complete understanding of the technical context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95+100)/2 = 97.5, rounded to 98"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Line 3","Agent1's approach is efficient but could benefit from more detailed analysis and documentation of decision rationale for better traceability and stakeholder confidence."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 1-7","Agent2's thorough analytical approach is exemplary for technical decision-making. The detailed reasoning and specific file analysis provide excellent documentation and justification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both agents demonstrate sound technical judgment. For future similar tasks, combining Agent1's efficiency with Agent2's thoroughness would create optimal output quality."
