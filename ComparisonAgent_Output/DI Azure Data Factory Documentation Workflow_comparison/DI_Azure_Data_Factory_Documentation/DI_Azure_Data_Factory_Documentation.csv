Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Ingest_BlobFiles_To_SQL_WithValidation Azure Data Factory pipeline. They demonstrate nearly identical semantic understanding, structural organization, and technical correctness, with only minor stylistic differences in presentation and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs demonstrate identical understanding of the pipeline's business purpose, technical components, and data flow logic. Minor differences exist in descriptive language and emphasis (e.g., 'curated SQL environment' vs 'reliable, repeatable ingestion') but core semantic meaning is preserved. Both correctly identify the same activities, dependencies, and business value proposition."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow nearly identical documentation structures with the same major sections: Overview, Pipeline Structure, Data Flow, Transformation Breakdown, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, and API Cost Calculations. Minor differences in subsection organization (e.g., Output 1 has 'High-Level Components' subsection, Output 2 integrates this into main Overview) and numbering schemes, but overall logical flow is consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,"Lines 1-200","Output 1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, valid internal references, and well-formed code blocks. Minor issue: Line 45 references 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' which appears to be a formatting artifact rather than intentional content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,99,"Lines 1-200","Output 2 shows near-perfect syntax correctness with clean markdown formatting, properly structured tables, consistent internal references, and valid code blocks. All technical references and formatting appear correct and professional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average correctness score across both outputs. Both demonstrate high-quality technical documentation with minimal syntax issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Address the formatting artifact 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' on line 45 and ensure consistent terminology throughout the document."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Consider adding the 'High-Level Components' subsection from Output 1 to provide clearer component overview upfront."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs represent high-quality documentation. Consider standardizing on a single format for future consistency. Output 2 has slightly cleaner formatting and could serve as the preferred template."
