# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Comparison analysis could not be completed due to insufficient input data.

**Issue:** The provided input contains template placeholders (`{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}`) instead of actual agent outputs. Without substantive content from both agents, meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation cannot be performed.

**Overall Scores:** All dimensions scored 0/100 due to lack of actual content to analyze.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale:** Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The input contains only template placeholders rather than real content that could be analyzed for meaning, intent, and purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)  
**Rationale:** Cannot assess structural similarity without actual outputs to compare. No logical flow, decomposition approach, or organizational structure is available for analysis.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1:** 0/100 - No actual output provided for syntax validation
- **Agent 2:** 0/100 - No actual output provided for syntax validation  
- **Overall:** 0/100 - Cannot calculate average without valid individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs:** Replace template placeholders with real agent-generated content to enable meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Ensure Content Completeness:** Verify that both agent outputs contain substantive content suitable for semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation.

3. **Validate Input Format:** Confirm that agent outputs are properly formatted and contain the expected type of content (code, documentation, analysis, or test cases).

4. **Re-run Analysis:** Once actual agent outputs are provided, re-execute this comparison process to obtain meaningful evaluation scores and insights.
