Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This indicates a potential issue with the input processing or template substitution."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Semantic analysis requires examining the meaning, intent, and purpose of both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Structural analysis requires examining logical flow, organization, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify input processing pipeline to ensure agent outputs are properly substituted into comparison template. 2. Re-run comparison once actual agent outputs are available. 3. Implement input validation to detect missing content before analysis begins."
