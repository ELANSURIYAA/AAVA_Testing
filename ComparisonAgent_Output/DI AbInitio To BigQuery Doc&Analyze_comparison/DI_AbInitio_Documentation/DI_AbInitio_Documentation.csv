Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Input contains template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that have not been populated with actual agent outputs. No content available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables detected instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables detected instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no content provided, only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no content provided, only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure content is properly formatted and accessible for analysis. 3. Verify that both agent outputs address the same task or instruction set. 4. Re-run comparison once actual content is available."
