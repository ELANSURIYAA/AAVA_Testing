Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are comprehensive cost and effort planning documents for Ab Initio to BigQuery SQL conversion. They share identical core structure, calculations, and technical content with minor formatting differences. Agent_1 uses standard markdown formatting while Agent_2 uses alternative heading styles. Both provide detailed BigQuery cost breakdowns ($30-$60/month), manual effort estimates (80-88 hours), developer costs ($4000-$4400), and comprehensive migration guidance. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment with nearly identical technical recommendations and cost formulas."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs address identical migration planning goals with same cost formulas, effort breakdowns, and technical recommendations. Minor differences in API costs ($0.024 vs $0.048) and total effort hours (88 vs 80) represent calculation variations rather than conceptual differences. Core semantic intent and technical guidance remain fully aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-15,"Both follow identical document structure: header block, BigQuery cost estimation, manual effort breakdown, API costs, and guidance sections. Agent_1 uses ## markdown headers while Agent_2 uses #### headers. Agent_2 includes additional summary table (lines 45-52) and input files section (lines 65-67) not present in Agent_1. Overall logical flow and section organization remain nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 12-15,"Excellent syntax and internal consistency. Minor formatting inconsistency in cost formula presentation where calculation shows ~$29.30 and ~$58.60 but rounds to $30-$60 range. All markdown syntax valid, calculations accurate, and internal references consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,Lines 45-52,"High syntactic correctness with valid markdown and consistent calculations. Summary table formatting could be improved for better readability. All cost formulas accurate and internal references properly maintained. Minor deduction for table presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 97) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs demonstrate excellent technical accuracy and syntactic validity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Maintain current comprehensive structure and technical depth. Consider standardizing cost formula presentation for consistency between narrative and calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent addition of summary table and input files section enhances usability. Consider improving table formatting and maintaining consistent header styling throughout document."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide excellent technical foundation for migration planning. Consider consolidating minor calculation differences (API costs, total hours) and standardizing formatting conventions for future consistency."
