Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs to enable comprehensive comparison analysis. Ensure placeholder variables are replaced with real content before running comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Verify that both agents received the same input prompt for fair comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Include line numbers in agent outputs to enable precise reference citations in analysis."
