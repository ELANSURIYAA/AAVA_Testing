Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort planning for Ab Initio to BigQuery migration. Output_1 presents more detailed formatting with clear section headers and comprehensive guidance. Output_2 includes additional summary tables and input file references. Both address the same core requirements with minor variations in presentation and calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs address identical migration planning goals with same cost categories (BigQuery query costs $30-60/month storage costs API costs manual effort estimation). Core semantic intent is preserved across both versions with same cost formulas and developer rates ($50/hr). Minor differences in effort hours (88 vs 80) and API costs ($0.024 vs $0.048) but overall meaning and purpose remain aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-150,"Both follow identical structural organization: BigQuery Cost Estimation Query Cost Breakdown Manual Code Fixing effort breakdown API Processing Cost Guidance sections. Output_1 uses more detailed markdown formatting with numbered sections (1.1 1.2 etc.) while Output_2 uses simpler heading structure. Both maintain logical flow from cost estimation to effort planning to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 20-25 45-50,"Well-formed document structure with proper markdown formatting. Minor inconsistency in total effort calculation: states 88 hours in summary but breakdown shows 40+16+12+20=88 hours which is correct. All cost calculations are mathematically accurate. One formatting issue with embedded quotes in cost formula section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,93,Lines 15-20 80-85,"Generally well-structured with proper formatting. Contains minor calculation discrepancy: effort breakdown shows 32+16+12+20=80 hours but uses different SQL Logic hours (32 vs 40 in Output_1). API cost differs ($0.048 vs $0.024). Summary table format is clear and accurate. Input file references at end are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 94. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper document structure formatting and mathematical accuracy. Minor variations in specific calculations but no major structural or formatting errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,Lines 100-150,"Excellent comprehensive guidance section with detailed migration challenges and recommendations. Consider standardizing effort hour calculations to ensure consistency between summary and detailed breakdown."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,Lines 90-140,"Good addition of summary table format and input file documentation. Consider aligning API cost calculations with standard rates and verify SQL Logic effort hours calculation for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide valuable migration planning baselines. Recommend creating a standardized template to ensure consistent calculations across similar assessments. Consider adding version control for cost assumptions and effort estimation methodologies."
