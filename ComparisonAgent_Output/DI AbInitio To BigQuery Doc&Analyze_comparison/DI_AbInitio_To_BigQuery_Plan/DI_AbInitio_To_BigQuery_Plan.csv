Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort planning for Ab Initio to BigQuery SQL conversion with similar core estimates. Output_1 provides more detailed breakdown and formatting while Output_2 offers more structured presentation with summary tables. Key differences include effort estimates (88 vs 80 hours) and API costs ($0.024 vs $0.048). Both maintain consistent BigQuery cost estimates ($30-60/month) and similar structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical migration planning goals with consistent BigQuery cost estimates ($30-60/month), similar effort categories, and comparable guidance. Minor semantic differences include Output_1 emphasizing 88 hours total effort vs Output_2's 80 hours, and different API cost values. Core migration challenges and recommendations align closely across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both follow similar structural patterns: BigQuery cost estimation, manual effort breakdown, API costs, and guidance sections. Output_1 uses more detailed subsections (1.1, 2.1, 2.2) while Output_2 employs cleaner markdown formatting with summary tables. Output_2 includes additional 'Input Files Used' section (lines 140-145) not present in Output_1. Overall flow and logical decomposition remain consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 45-50, 85-90","Well-formatted markdown with consistent structure. Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost formula presentation and some spacing irregularities in table formatting. All calculations are mathematically sound and references are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,92,"Lines 35-40, 125-130","Clean markdown formatting with good table structure. Some inconsistencies in header levels (mixing #### and #####). Mathematical calculations are accurate. Additional file path references at end are properly formatted but could be cleaner."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, accurate calculations, and consistent internal structure. Minor formatting variations and header level inconsistencies prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,"Lines 110-150","Maintain the detailed breakdown approach but standardize formatting consistency. Consider adding summary tables similar to Output_2 for better readability. The comprehensive guidance section is valuable and should be retained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,"Lines 90-145","Excellent use of summary tables and clean formatting. Consider standardizing header levels throughout the document. The input files section adds valuable traceability but could be better integrated into the main content flow."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs provide solid migration planning foundations. Recommend combining Output_1's detailed breakdown with Output_2's clean formatting and summary tables. Standardize effort estimates (resolve 88 vs 80 hour discrepancy) and API cost calculations for consistency across future reports."
