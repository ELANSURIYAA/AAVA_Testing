# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The provided input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` that were not replaced with actual content, making meaningful comparison impossible.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Both agent outputs are required to assess meaning, intent, and overall purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Analysis requires examining logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches of both outputs.

### Correctness
- **Agent1**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content
- **Agent2**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace placeholder variables with real agent output content to enable meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Verify Input Processing**: Ensure the input processing pipeline correctly substitutes variables before analysis.

3. **Content Validation**: Implement input validation to detect and handle missing or malformed agent outputs.
