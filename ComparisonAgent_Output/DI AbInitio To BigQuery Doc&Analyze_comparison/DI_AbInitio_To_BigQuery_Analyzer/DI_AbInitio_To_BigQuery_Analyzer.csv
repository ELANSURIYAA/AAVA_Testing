Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis of Ab Initio ETL flow migration to BigQuery SQL. Agent1 uses a structured bullet-point approach with clear sections for syntax differences, manual interventions, complexity evaluation (75/100), and refactor recommendation. Agent2 employs a table-based format with detailed component mapping, higher complexity score (85/100), and rebuild recommendation. Both cover identical core concepts but differ in presentation style, complexity assessment, and optimization approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the identical core objective of analyzing Ab Initio ETL components for BigQuery migration. They cover the same fundamental concepts: component mapping (Input Table, Reformat, Sort, Dedup), syntax differences, manual interventions needed, and optimization recommendations. Key semantic alignment includes discussion of .xfr file translation, schema restructuring, parameterization challenges, and error handling. Minor divergence exists in complexity scoring (75 vs 85) and optimization approach (Refactor vs Rebuild), but overall intent and technical understanding are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,N/A,"Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent1 follows a linear narrative structure with bullet points and nested sub-sections under main headings (Syntax Differences, Manual Interventions, Complexity Evaluation, Optimization Recommendation). Agent2 uses a table-driven approach with structured component mapping tables, followed by bulleted sections. Both maintain logical flow from component analysis to recommendations, but Agent2 includes additional sections like 'SQL Design Suggestions' and 'Validation Checkpoints' not present in Agent1. The core analytical flow is similar but presentation methodology varies substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,N/A,"Agent1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown structure, consistent bullet formatting, and clear section delineation. All technical references are accurate and properly formatted. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in some bullet points and the complexity score presentation could be more standardized."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,N/A,"Agent2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with properly formatted markdown tables, consistent section headers, and well-structured bullet points. Technical terminology is accurate throughout, and the table formatting is clean and readable. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet point indentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, accurate technical content, and clear organizational structure. Agent2 slightly edges out with more consistent formatting and cleaner table presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Consider adopting more structured presentation format with tables for component mapping to improve readability and technical clarity. The complexity scoring methodology could benefit from more detailed breakdown criteria."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,Lines 80-95,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with strong table-based component mapping. Consider adding more specific line-by-line .xfr translation examples to enhance practical implementation guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring rubric with detailed criteria breakdown, 2) More specific code examples for .xfr to SQL translation, 3) Unified recommendation format (Refactor vs Rebuild discrepancy should be resolved), 4) Addition of estimated effort/timeline for manual interventions identified."
