Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual agent outputs. This analysis framework is ready to process actual outputs once provided."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework is configured to analyze meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Framework is configured to analyze logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_To_BigQuery_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_To_BigQuery_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure outputs are properly formatted and complete. 3. Include any relevant metadata or context for accurate evaluation. 4. Verify that both agents received the same input instructions for fair comparison."
