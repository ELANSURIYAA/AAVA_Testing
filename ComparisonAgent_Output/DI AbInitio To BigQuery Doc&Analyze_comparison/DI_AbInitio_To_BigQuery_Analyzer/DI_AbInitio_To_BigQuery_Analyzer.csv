Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis of Ab Initio ETL flow migration to BigQuery SQL. Agent_1 uses a structured narrative format with bullet points and detailed explanations, while Agent_2 employs a table-based approach with clearer section divisions. Both cover identical core topics: syntax differences, manual interventions, complexity evaluation, and optimization recommendations. The semantic alignment is strong with both identifying the same technical challenges and solutions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 60-120","Both outputs address identical migration goals and technical concepts. Agent_1 provides more detailed explanations of each component mapping (lines 10-40), while Agent_2 uses a concise table format (lines 15-35) covering the same mappings. Both identify the same incompatible behaviors: reject ports, procedural logic, and record-level transformations. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on technical implementation details, Agent_2 emphasizes operational considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-200","Significant structural differences exist. Agent_1 uses a narrative format with nested bullet points and flowing text sections. Agent_2 employs a structured approach with tables, clear section headers, and systematic organization. Both follow the same logical flow: Syntax Differences → Manual Interventions → Complexity → Recommendations, but present information differently. Agent_2's table-based component mapping (lines 15-35) is more scannable than Agent_1's narrative approach (lines 10-40)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 80-90","Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point nesting (line 85). All technical content is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting. References to Ab Initio components and BigQuery equivalents are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-200","Excellent formatting consistency throughout. Table structures are well-formed, markdown syntax is correct, and all technical references are accurate. Minor issue: API cost format could be more consistent with standard currency formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and accurate technical content. Agent_2 shows slightly better formatting consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 150-170","Consider adopting a more structured presentation format similar to Agent_2's table-based approach for component mappings. This would improve readability and make the analysis more scannable for technical stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 180-200","Excellent structure and organization. Consider adding more detailed explanations for complex technical concepts, similar to Agent_1's approach, to provide additional context for less technical readers."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide valuable migration analysis. Consider combining Agent_1's detailed explanations with Agent_2's structured presentation format for optimal documentation. Both correctly identify the need for rebuild approach and provide comprehensive technical guidance."
