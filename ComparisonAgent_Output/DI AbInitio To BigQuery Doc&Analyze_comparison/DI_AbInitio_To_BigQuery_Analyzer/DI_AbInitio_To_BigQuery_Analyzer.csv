Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Placeholder values {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were provided instead of actual content. A proper comparison requires actual agent outputs to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meaning, intent, and purpose of two real outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, decomposition, and organization patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder values for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure outputs contain substantive content for semantic analysis. 3. Include proper formatting and structure for structural comparison. 4. Verify syntax validity for correctness evaluation."
