- All files from AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 are present and detected.
- No files were genuinely matched due to gate failures at intent, token, structural, or semantic levels.
- Every component is marked "Not Comparable" with "High" migration impact.
- Migration safety cannot be assured; manual review is required.
- The comparison is incomplete due to unmatched files across all components.

SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a rigorous, gate-driven comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. All six input files were validated as physically present, and each was processed through the multi-gate framework to ensure only genuine matches are reported. However, no files passed all gates required for a valid one-to-one match. As a result, every component is flagged as "Not Comparable," and the migration impact is set to "High" for all. The absence of any valid matches significantly limits the ability to assess migration equivalence or readiness.

Note: 3 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- No file pairs passed all matching gates, resulting in zero valid matches.
- The strongest finding is strict gate enforcement prevented false equivalence.
- All components remain unmatched, requiring manual intervention.
- Confidence in migration readiness is low due to incomplete comparison.
- Conditional recommendation: Migration should not proceed without further review.
- Business continuity cannot be assured under current conditions.

| AAVA 2.0    | abap_documentation.txt       | No match in AAVA 1.0 - Gate 1 failed (intent mismatch) |

- All files failed at Gate 1 (intent mismatch), preventing further matching.
- No valid comparison pairs; completeness is 0%.
- Unmatched files severely impact migration reliability.
- Matched pairs cannot be relied upon for migration assessment.

---

SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED

The match percentage is determined only for genuinely matched pairs, using a line-by-line diff: unchanged lines divided by total lines, expressed as a percentage. Since no files passed all gates, no match percentages were calculated. The following scale interprets match percentages:

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication      |
|------------------|------------|------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes       |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only  |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring      |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes    |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review  |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file  |

- Match percentage alone does not indicate readiness.
- Dimension scores provide deeper insight but were not applicable.
- Both metrics together guide migration decisions.
- A 90% threshold is required for a PASS, but no files qualified.

SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE

| Decision Element         | Value          |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Final Recommendation    | NOT APPROVED   |
| Primary Justification   | No files passed matching gates; migration cannot proceed. |
| Confidence Level        | LOW            |
| Recommended Timeline    | Not recommended|
| Priority                | Action Required| Responsible Team    | Timeline  |

- Migration is not recommended due to lack of valid matches.
- Manual review and remediation are required before reconsideration.
- Migration readiness and business continuity cannot be assured.

This report applies strict multi-gate validation and deterministic matching rules. No valid matches were found, and migration cannot be approved under current conditions. All findings are evidence-based and reproducible.
