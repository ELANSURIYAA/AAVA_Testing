- All three components (Documentation, Analyzer, Plan) were matched one-to-one with high confidence and passed all gates.
- No unmatched or invalid files were detected; every artifact from AAVA 1.0 found a genuine match in AAVA 2.0.
- All matched pairs achieved "Equivalent" status with match percentages above 97.7% and dimension scores above 97/100.
- Migration impact is "None" for all components, indicating no risk for workflow migration.
- The comparison is complete and fully deterministic, with no gaps or unresolved mappings.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report provides a comprehensive, deterministic comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. All three workflow components—Documentation, Analyzer, and Plan—were validated for strict one-to-one correspondence using multi-gate matching (intent, token, structural, and semantic). No unmatched or invalid files were found. All matched pairs exhibited near-identical content, structure, and business logic, achieving "Equivalent" status. The migration impact is assessed as "None" across all components, and the comparison is complete with high confidence.

- All files were matched with 98.5% average content equivalence.
- No unmatched or invalid artifacts; full input coverage achieved.
- All matched pairs passed every gate and scored above 97/100 in all dimensions.
- Confidence level is HIGH due to complete and deterministic matching.
- Recommendation: Proceed with migration; business continuity is fully supported.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line diff was performed for each matched pair. Match percentage is calculated as the ratio of unchanged lines to total lines, rounded to one decimal place.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication         |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes          |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only     |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring         |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes       |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review     |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file      |

- Match % alone does not determine readiness; dimension scores provide deeper insight.
- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.
- 90% threshold applied for PASS status.
- All matched pairs exceeded the pass threshold.
