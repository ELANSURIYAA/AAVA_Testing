Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Agent outputs were not provided in the input - only placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found. Actual content is required to conduct semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholders provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholders provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."
