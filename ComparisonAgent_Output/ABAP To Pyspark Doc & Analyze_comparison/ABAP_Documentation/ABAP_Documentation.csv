Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis. The provided inputs contain template placeholders ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No substantive content was available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template placeholders were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template placeholders were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Template placeholder {{agent 1_string_true}} was provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Template placeholder {{agent 2_string_true}} was provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."
