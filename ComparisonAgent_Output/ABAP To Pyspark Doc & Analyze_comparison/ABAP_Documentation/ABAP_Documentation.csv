Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-80 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same ABAP program that loads financial data from CSV to SAP BW. Agent 1 focuses on core functionality with 9 sections, while Agent 2 provides more detailed analysis with 11 sections including performance optimization and field descriptions. Both achieve the same documentation goal with different depth levels."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15 (both agents)","Both outputs address the identical program purpose: loading financial data from CSV to SAP BW table. The core business problem, ETL process description, and data mapping are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in terminology (Agent 1 uses 'reports' vs Agent 2 uses 'analytics') and emphasis (Agent 2 includes more business context) but overall meaning and intent are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 16-30 (Agent 1), Lines 20-40 (Agent 2)","Both follow similar documentation structure with overview, code structure, data flow, and mapping sections. Agent 1 uses 9 main sections while Agent 2 uses 11 sections. Key structural differences: Agent 2 adds Performance Optimization (section 10) and Field Descriptions (section 8), while Agent 1 combines some concepts. Flow and logical progression are comparable but not identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 25-35, 40-45","Syntactically well-formed documentation with consistent internal references. Minor issues: Line 32 shows 'DML Statements: 2' but only lists INSERT and COMMIT/ROLLBACK (should clarify if COMMIT/ROLLBACK count as DML). Table formatting is consistent and all section references are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 30-50, 60-70","Excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive internal consistency. All section references are valid, table formatting is proper, and technical details are accurately presented. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 45 where 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a placeholder that wasn't properly replaced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 40-50","Consider adding performance optimization section and field descriptions table for completeness. Clarify DML statement counting methodology in complexity analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 45, 65","Replace placeholder text 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' with proper terminology. Consider consolidating some sections to improve readability while maintaining comprehensive coverage."
