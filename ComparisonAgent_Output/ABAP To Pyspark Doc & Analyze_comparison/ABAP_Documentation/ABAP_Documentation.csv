Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the ABAP program 'zload_finance_to_bw' that loads financial data from CSV files into SAP BW. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment with identical business purpose and technical approach. Structural similarity is strong with both following numbered section formats, though Agent 2 includes additional optimization and best practices sections. Both outputs are syntactically correct as documentation with proper formatting and consistent internal references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 60-80","Both outputs address the identical ABAP program with same business purpose: automating financial data ETL from CSV to SAP BW. Core concepts like data validation, field mapping, error handling are consistently described. Minor differences in emphasis - Agent 2 provides more detailed business context and performance considerations. Overall intent and meaning are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 100-120, 150-170","Both follow similar numbered section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, Assumptions. Agent 2 includes additional sections 10-11 (Performance Optimization, Technical Elements) and more detailed subsections. Core logical flow and decomposition approach are very similar with same information hierarchy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 80-90, 120-130","Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured tables. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity analysis table alignment. All section references are valid and content is internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,"Lines 90-100, 140-150","Documentation is syntactically correct with excellent markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured tables. All section numbering is sequential, table formatting is consistent, and internal cross-references are valid. Very minor spacing inconsistency in one table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness as documentation with proper formatting and internal consistency."
