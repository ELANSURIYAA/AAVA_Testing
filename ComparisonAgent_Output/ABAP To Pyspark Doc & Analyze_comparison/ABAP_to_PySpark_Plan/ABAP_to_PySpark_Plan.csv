Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimates for testing PySpark code converted from ABAP scripts. Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate offers superior structure and detail while Agent1_CostEstimation provides concise essential information. Key estimates align closely with minor calculation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15, 20-35","Both outputs address identical objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation, testing effort calculation, and API cost reporting. Core calculations are nearly identical (Agent1: $0.57-$2.85 vs Agent2: $4.95-$24.75 due to different execution assumptions). Both estimate 14 vs 10 hours for testing effort with similar breakdown rationale. Minor divergence in execution count assumptions (1 vs 10 runs) affects final costs but methodology remains consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-50","Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate demonstrates superior structural organization with markdown formatting, numbered sections (1.1, 2.1, etc.), and comprehensive summary tables. Agent1_CostEstimation uses simpler nested bullet structure. Both follow logical flow: cost estimation → testing effort → API costs → summary. Agent2 includes additional sections like 'Complete Content Reference' and detailed reasoning blocks that enhance comprehensiveness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_CostEstimation,95,"Lines 8-12","Minor formatting inconsistency in currency notation ($0.57 - $2.85 USD vs standard $0.57-$2.85). All calculations are mathematically sound and internal references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,98,"Lines 25-30","Excellent markdown syntax compliance and internal consistency. Minor issue with table formatting in summary section could be improved but does not affect readability or correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_CostEstimation,,"Lines 1-50","Consider adopting structured formatting similar to Agent2 for improved readability. Add detailed reasoning sections and comprehensive summary tables. Clarify execution count assumptions for cost calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,,"Lines 1-100","Maintain excellent structural approach. Consider condensing some sections for conciseness while preserving detail. Ensure table formatting consistency throughout document."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-100","Standardize execution count assumptions for cost calculations. Both approaches have merit - combine Agent1's conciseness with Agent2's comprehensive structure for optimal output."
