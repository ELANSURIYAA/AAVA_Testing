Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both Agent1_CostEstimation and Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate provide cost and effort estimates for PySpark code conversion from ABAP. Agent1_CostEstimation delivers a concise, structured analysis with basic calculations, while Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate provides comprehensive documentation with detailed reasoning, markdown formatting, and extensive context. Both reach similar cost conclusions ($0.57-$2.85 vs $4.95-$24.75 range) but differ significantly in scope and presentation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective: estimating costs and effort for PySpark conversion from ABAP scripts. Agent1_CostEstimation focuses on runtime costs ($0.57-$2.85), testing effort (14 hours), and API costs. Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate covers similar ground but with expanded scope including 10 test executions ($4.95-$24.75 total cost) and reduced effort estimate (10 hours). The semantic alignment is strong as both interpret the task as comprehensive cost analysis, though Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate provides more detailed reasoning and context."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,Lines 1-50,"Significant structural differences exist. Agent1_CostEstimation uses simple numbered sections (1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing, 3. API Cost) with basic subsections. Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate employs professional markdown structure with hierarchical headings, detailed subsections, code blocks, and summary tables. Agent1_CostEstimation follows a linear flow while Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate uses comprehensive documentation standards with cross-references and detailed explanations. The logical flow is similar but presentation approaches differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_CostEstimation,95,Lines 15-20,"Minor calculation inconsistency: states 'Total Data Processed: 380 GB' but sum of (2TB + 500GB + 500GB + 100GB + 200GB) * 10% = 330GB, not 380GB. All other syntax and mathematical calculations are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,100,All Lines,"Syntactically perfect markdown formatting with correct mathematical calculations, proper table structures, valid code block formatting, and consistent internal references. All calculations are accurate and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with only minor calculation error in Agent1_CostEstimation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_CostEstimation,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Correct the calculation error in total data processed (should be 330GB not 380GB). Consider adding more detailed reasoning for cost assumptions and expanding documentation structure for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,N/A,All Lines,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider aligning cost estimates more closely with simpler calculation methods to ensure consistency across different analysis approaches. The detailed structure and reasoning are exemplary."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized calculation methodologies to ensure consistent cost estimates. Consider establishing common assumptions about test execution frequency and DBU consumption rates for future analyses."
