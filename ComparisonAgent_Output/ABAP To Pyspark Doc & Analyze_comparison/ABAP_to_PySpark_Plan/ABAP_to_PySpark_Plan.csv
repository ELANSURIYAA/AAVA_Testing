Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-47 (Concise_Estimate), Lines 1-156 (Comprehensive_Report)","Both outputs provide cost and effort estimates for PySpark conversion from ABAP scripts. Concise_Estimate delivers a straightforward calculation approach while Comprehensive_Report provides detailed methodology and documentation. Both reach similar conclusions with minor variations in final estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15 (Concise_Estimate), Lines 12-35 (Comprehensive_Report)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation and testing effort calculation. Key semantic alignment includes: (1) Same data volume assumptions (2 TB FINANCE_DATA_RAW, 500 GB others), (2) 10% processing volume factor, (3) DBU pricing range $0.15-$0.75, (4) Similar effort breakdown for code fixes and validation. Minor semantic differences: Concise_Estimate uses 380 GB total processed vs Comprehensive_Report's 330 GB calculation, and different assumptions about test execution count (implicit single run vs explicit 10 runs)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-47 (Concise_Estimate), Lines 1-156 (Comprehensive_Report)","Moderate structural alignment with different presentation approaches. Similarities: (1) Both follow logical sequence: Cost Estimation → Code Fixing Effort → API Cost → Summary, (2) Both break down PySpark costs and testing effort separately, (3) Both provide final summary sections. Differences: (1) Concise_Estimate uses simple numbered hierarchy (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1) vs Comprehensive_Report's markdown headers (##, ###), (2) Comprehensive_Report includes additional sections like complete code reference and detailed reasoning, (3) Different granularity in subsection organization and formatting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Concise_Estimate,92,"Lines 8-13, 19-25, 32-38","Syntactically correct with minor calculation discrepancies. Issues: (1) Line 11: Total data calculation shows 380 GB but arithmetic (2000+500+500+100+200)*0.1 = 330 GB, (2) Line 12: Runtime calculation assumes 1 DBU per 100 GB/hour but uses 380 GB incorrectly, (3) Lines 19-25: Testing effort estimates are reasonable but lack detailed justification for 8-hour code fixing estimate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Report,96,"Lines 15-28, 45-65, 89-105","High syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and accurate calculations. Minor issues: (1) Lines 21-26: Correct arithmetic showing 330 GB total processed, (2) Lines 29-35: Proper DBU calculation methodology, (3) Lines 45-52: Well-justified effort estimates with detailed reasoning, (4) Lines 89-156: Complete code reference enhances correctness verification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (92 + 96) / 2 = 94. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with Comprehensive_Report showing slightly better accuracy in calculations and documentation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Concise_Estimate,,"Lines 8-13, 32-38","Correct the data volume calculation error (should be 330 GB not 380 GB) and provide more detailed justification for effort estimates. Consider adding methodology explanations to improve transparency and reproducibility of calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Report,,"Lines 45-65, 110-140","Excellent comprehensive approach with proper documentation and methodology. Minor suggestion to add executive summary section at the beginning for quick reference. The detailed structure and code inclusion make this highly valuable for stakeholders."
