Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were provided as placeholders rather than actual content. Proper comparison requires actual output content from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity structural similarity and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent output content. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meaning intent and purpose of both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent output content. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow organization and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform proper comparison: 1) Provide actual agent output content instead of placeholders 2) Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted 3) Include relevant context or requirements for comparison task."
