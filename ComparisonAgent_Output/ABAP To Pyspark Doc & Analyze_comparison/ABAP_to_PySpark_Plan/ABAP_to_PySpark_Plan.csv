Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimates for ABAP to PySpark conversion testing. Agent 2 delivers superior organization with markdown formatting, detailed calculations, and professional structure, while Agent 1 provides equivalent semantic content in a simpler format. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy and practical applicability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-45 (Agent 1), Lines 1-150 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation, code fixing effort, output validation, and API costs. Agent 1 estimates $0.57-$2.85 runtime cost and 14 hours total effort. Agent 2 estimates $4.95-$24.75 runtime cost and 10 hours total effort. The difference in runtime costs stems from Agent 2 including multiple test executions (10 runs) while Agent 1 appears to estimate single execution. Both use same DBU pricing and data volumes. Semantic alignment is strong despite different cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-45 (Agent 1), Lines 1-150 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses simple numbered hierarchy (1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing, 3. API Cost) with subsections. Agent 2 employs professional markdown structure with headers, subheaders, code blocks, and summary tables. Both follow logical flow: cost estimation → effort estimation → API cost → summary. Agent 2 includes additional elements like reasoning sections, complete content reference, and formatted summary table. Structure serves same purpose but with different sophistication levels."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 1-45","Plain text format is syntactically correct with proper numbering, consistent indentation, and clear section breaks. All calculations are mathematically sound. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 23 where 'Total Effort: 14 hours' could be better aligned with other summary items. No syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-150","Markdown syntax is flawless with proper headers, code blocks, tables, and formatting. All internal references are consistent, calculations are accurate, and structure is well-formed. Professional documentation standards are met throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of Agent_1 (98) and Agent_2 (100). Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with Agent_2 achieving perfect markdown formatting and Agent_1 having minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider adopting structured formatting (markdown or similar) to improve readability and professional presentation. Add reasoning sections to justify cost calculations and assumptions. Include multiple execution scenarios in cost estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent structure and presentation. Consider adding executive summary section at the beginning. Ensure cost calculation assumptions are clearly stated upfront for better accessibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable cost estimation frameworks. Agent_2's approach should be used as template for future documentation due to superior organization and completeness. Consider standardizing on markdown format for consistency across deliverables."
