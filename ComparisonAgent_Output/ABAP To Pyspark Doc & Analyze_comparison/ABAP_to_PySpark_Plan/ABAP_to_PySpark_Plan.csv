Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were provided instead of actual agent outputs. A proper comparison requires the actual content from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires comparison of intent, meaning, and purpose between two real outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires analysis of logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To complete this analysis, please provide: 1) Actual Agent 1 output content instead of placeholder variable, 2) Actual Agent 2 output content instead of placeholder variable, 3) Clear identification of the output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test case), 4) Any specific requirements or context for the comparison. Once real outputs are provided, a comprehensive evaluation can be performed across all three dimensions with detailed scoring and line-by-line analysis."
