Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two distinct approaches to ABAP-to-PySpark conversion effort estimation. Agent_Basic provides concise calculations with $0.57-$2.85 runtime cost and 14 hours effort. Agent_Comprehensive delivers detailed analysis with $4.95-$24.75 runtime cost and 10 hours effort. Key differences: calculation methodology, presentation format, and detail level. Both are syntactically correct but differ in assumptions and thoroughness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,All,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: PySpark runtime cost estimation, code fixing effort, and API costs. However, they differ significantly in calculation assumptions. Agent_Basic assumes single execution (lines 10-11) while Agent_Comprehensive assumes 10 test executions (lines 25-26). Both correctly identify the same data volumes and processing percentages. The fundamental intent and domain understanding are aligned, but execution strategies diverge."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,All,"Agent_Basic uses simple numbered hierarchy (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1, etc.) with basic text formatting. Agent_Comprehensive employs markdown structure with headers, tables, code blocks, and comprehensive sections. Both follow logical flow: cost estimation → effort estimation → API cost → summary. However, Agent_Comprehensive includes additional sections like complete content reference and detailed reasoning that Agent_Basic lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Basic,95,Lines 10-11,"Syntactically correct with minor calculation inconsistency. States 380 GB total data processed but calculates runtime as 3.8 hours assuming 100 GB/hour processing rate, which should yield 3.8 hours for 380 GB. Math is internally consistent. All sections properly formatted and complete."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive,98,All,"Excellent syntax and internal consistency. Proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, and accurate mathematical calculations throughout. Minor deduction for assumption that may not be explicitly stated in requirements (10 test executions vs single execution). All references and calculations are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of Agent_Basic (95) and Agent_Comprehensive (98). Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Differences mainly in calculation assumptions rather than syntax errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Basic,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Strengthen the output by: 1) Adding detailed reasoning for calculation assumptions, 2) Including multiple execution scenarios, 3) Providing structured formatting for better readability, 4) Adding comprehensive validation methodology section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Minor improvements: 1) Clarify assumption rationale for 10 test executions, 2) Consider providing both single and multiple execution scenarios, 3) Add executive summary section for quick reference."
