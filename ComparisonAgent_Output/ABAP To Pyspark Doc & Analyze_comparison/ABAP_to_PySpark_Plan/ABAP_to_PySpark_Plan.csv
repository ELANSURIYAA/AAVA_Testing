Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Cost_Estimation and Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate outputs address the same fundamental task of estimating costs and effort for testing PySpark code converted from ABAP scripts. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (85/100) with similar cost calculations, data processing assumptions, and effort estimates. Structural similarity is moderate (75/100) due to different formatting approaches - Cost_Estimation uses plain text while Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate uses detailed markdown formatting. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each) with proper formatting for their respective styles."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation using DBU pricing ($0.15-$0.75/hour), code fixing effort estimation (8 vs 7 hours), output validation effort (6 vs 3 hours), and API cost reporting. Key semantic alignments include: same data volume assumptions (2TB FINANCE_DATA_RAW, 500GB other tables), same 10% processing volume assumption, similar DBU consumption calculations (3.8 vs 3.3 DBU-hours), and comparable cost ranges ($0.57-$2.85 vs $4.95-$24.75 accounting for test runs). Minor differences in total effort estimates (14 vs 10 hours) reflect different granularity levels but same underlying methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: 1) Cost Estimation section with PySpark runtime calculations, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort section with manual fixes and validation components, 3) API Cost section, 4) Summary section. However, significant structural differences exist: Cost_Estimation uses plain numbered outline format (1.1, 2.1, etc.) while Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate uses markdown headers, tables, and detailed subsections. Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate includes additional structural elements like reasoning sections, complete content reference with code blocks, and formatted summary table that Cost_Estimation lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Cost_Estimation,100,Lines 1-50,"Cost_Estimation output is syntactically correct with proper plain text formatting, consistent numbering scheme (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3), accurate mathematical calculations, proper currency formatting, and logical flow. No syntax errors, undefined references, or formatting inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate,100,Lines 1-200,"Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate output is syntactically correct with valid markdown formatting, proper header hierarchy, correctly formatted code blocks, accurate table structures, consistent bullet points and numbering, and proper escaping of special characters. No markdown syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness within their respective formatting paradigms. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Cost_Estimation,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Consider adopting more detailed documentation structure similar to Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate, including reasoning sections, formatted tables, and complete reference materials to improve readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Effort_Estimate,N/A,Lines 1-200,"Consider providing more concise summary formats alongside detailed documentation to accommodate different audience needs and quick reference requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost calculation methodology to resolve differences in test run assumptions, 2) Consistent effort estimation granularity, 3) Cross-validation of mathematical calculations, 4) Unified formatting standards for similar deliverables."
