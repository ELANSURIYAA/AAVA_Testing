Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive ABAP to PySpark conversion analysis reports with high semantic alignment (92/100) and good structural similarity (78/100). Agent 2 demonstrates superior organization and completeness with 10 structured sections vs Agent 1's 6 sections. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each). Agent 2 provides more actionable recommendations including complete ABAP code listing, data type conversion guidance, and best practices. Overall assessment: 90/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs address ABAP to PySpark conversion analysis with nearly identical intent and purpose. Core metrics align closely: complexity scores (40/100 vs 20/100), similar identification of key conversion challenges (file operations, error handling, transaction management), and consistent optimization recommendations. Minor divergence in complexity scoring methodology and emphasis on different technical aspects. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage with additional sections on data types and best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,All,"Agent 1 uses 6 main sections with numbered structure (1-6). Agent 2 uses 10 main sections with markdown formatting and hierarchical organization. Both follow logical flow: metrics → complexity → syntax differences → adjustments → optimization. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements: complete code listing (lines 180-230), data type conversions (section 6), ABAP features analysis (section 7), and best practices (section 8). Different formatting approaches but similar analytical progression."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, valid metrics reporting, and coherent technical content. All internal references are consistent, no broken formatting or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All,"Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid code blocks, consistent section structure, and accurate technical content. ABAP code syntax in lines 180-230 is valid, all internal references are consistent, no formatting or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Average correctness score: (100+100)/2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Strengthen structural organization by adopting numbered sections consistently. Consider adding complete code examples and expanding optimization techniques section. Include more detailed best practices guidance for maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-250,"Excellent comprehensive structure and content. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology to align with industry benchmarks. Minor improvement: add more specific line references in optimization recommendations section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide valuable ABAP to PySpark conversion analysis. Agent 2 offers superior completeness and organization, making it more actionable for implementation teams. Recommend using Agent 2 as the primary reference while incorporating Agent 1's concise metrics presentation style."
