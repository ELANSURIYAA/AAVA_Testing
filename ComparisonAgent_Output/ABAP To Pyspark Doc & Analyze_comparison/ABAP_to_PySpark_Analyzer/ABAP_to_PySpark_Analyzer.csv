Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive ABAP to PySpark conversion analysis reports. Agent 1 delivers a concise 6-section analysis focusing on key metrics, while Agent 2 provides an extensive 10-section detailed report with complete code examples and best practices. Both address the same core conversion challenges but with different levels of depth and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-6 (both agents)","Both outputs address identical conversion goals: analyzing ABAP code complexity, identifying syntax differences, and providing PySpark conversion guidance. Agent 1 focuses on quantitative metrics (40/100 complexity score), while Agent 2 provides lower complexity assessment (20/100) with more detailed breakdown. Both identify similar high-complexity areas: file operations, error handling, transaction management."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses 6 main sections (Complexity Metrics, Conversion Complexity, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, apiCost). Agent 2 uses 10 sections including additional areas like Data Type Conversions, Best Practices, and Complete ABAP Code. Both follow logical progression from analysis to recommendations but with different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Analyzer_1,95,"Lines 8-15, 25-30","Minor inconsistencies: Claims 0 SELECT statements and function modules but provides accurate counts for other metrics. Error handling count (1) is understated given multiple sy-subrc checks in the code. Overall syntax and structure are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_to_PySpark_Analyzer_2,98,"Lines 20-35, 180-200","Highly accurate metrics with detailed breakdown. Correctly identifies 5 conditional logic statements, 8 syntax differences, and provides complete ABAP code for reference. Minor formatting inconsistency in apiCost presentation (0.0072 vs $0.00 format)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical analysis and valid recommendations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,ABAP_to_PySpark_Analyzer_1,,"Lines 35-45","Focus on core conversion strategies: replace file operations with spark.read.csv, implement Python exception handling, use DataFrame operations for data manipulation, leverage distributed processing capabilities."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ABAP_to_PySpark_Analyzer_2,,"Lines 60-150","Comprehensive recommendations including modularization, configuration management, performance tuning, schema definition, monitoring integration, and maintenance best practices. Provides specific PySpark methods and optimization strategies."
