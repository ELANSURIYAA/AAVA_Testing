Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a Snowflake to PySpark documentation/analysis comparison task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would compare intent, meaning, and purpose of both outputs regarding Snowflake to PySpark migration documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would analyze logical flow, section organization, and documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness without individual agent scores."
