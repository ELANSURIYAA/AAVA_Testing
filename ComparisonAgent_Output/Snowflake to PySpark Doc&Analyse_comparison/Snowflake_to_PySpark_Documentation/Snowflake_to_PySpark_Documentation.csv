Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Snowflake SQL stored procedure 'sp_Order_Detail'. The documentation covers enterprise data warehousing alignment, business problem analysis, technical implementation details, and performance considerations. Both outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical understanding of the procedure's purpose and business value. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) with both following the same comprehensive documentation framework. Correctness scores are high for both outputs (Output1: 98/100, Output2: 96/100) with minor formatting and consistency differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in understanding the stored procedure's purpose, business value, and technical implementation. Key similarities include: identical understanding of the procedure's goal to process past month's order data, consistent description of customer summarization logic, aligned business benefits around customer insights and analytics, and matching technical component identification. Minor differences exist in emphasis on specific enterprise features and slightly different phrasing of business benefits, but core meaning and intent are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with the same major sections in the same order: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. The logical flow and decomposition approach are consistent. Minor structural differences include: Output2 uses more detailed subsection headers in some areas, Output1 has slightly more concise section organization, and Output2 includes additional formatting elements like horizontal rules. Overall structure and information architecture are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,98,"Lines 5, 45, 180","Output1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness and internal consistency. Minor issues include: Line 5 - minor inconsistency in capitalization of 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' vs 'reporting', Line 45 - slight formatting inconsistency in bullet point structure, Line 180 - minor punctuation inconsistency in list formatting. All technical references are accurate, section references are consistent, and no broken internal links or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,96,"Lines 12, 78, 165, 195","Output2 shows high syntactic correctness with some minor formatting and consistency issues. Issues identified: Line 12 - inconsistent use of 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' terminology, Line 78 - minor formatting inconsistency in code block presentation, Line 165 - slight inconsistency in numerical formatting for complexity scores, Line 195 - minor punctuation variation in final sections. All technical content is accurate and well-formed with no major syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average correctness score across both outputs. Both demonstrate high syntactic accuracy with only minor formatting and consistency variations that do not impact overall quality or readability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Lines 5, 45, 180","Address minor capitalization inconsistencies in terminology usage. Standardize bullet point formatting throughout the document. Ensure consistent punctuation in list structures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Lines 12, 78, 165, 195","Standardize the use of technical terminology like 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' vs 'reporting'. Improve consistency in code block formatting. Standardize numerical formatting for scores and metrics. Review punctuation consistency in final sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs represent high-quality comprehensive documentation with excellent semantic and structural alignment. Consider: establishing a documentation style guide for consistent terminology usage, implementing automated formatting validation, and creating templates for consistent section organization. The outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the technical content and business context with only minor presentation improvements needed."
