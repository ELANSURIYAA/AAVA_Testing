Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Comparison analysis failed due to missing input data. The provided inputs contained unresolved template variables instead of actual agent outputs. Template variables detected: {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}. Without actual content from both agents, no meaningful comparison can be performed across semantic similarity, structural similarity, or correctness dimensions. This represents a critical input validation failure that prevents any substantive analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Semantic similarity assessment impossible without actual agent outputs. This dimension requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of two concrete outputs. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} provide no semantic content to analyze. Score: 0 due to absence of comparable content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Structural similarity assessment impossible without actual agent outputs. This dimension requires analyzing logical structure, flow, and decomposition patterns. Template variables provide no structural information to compare. Score: 0 due to absence of structural elements to evaluate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Agent,0,N/A,"Correctness assessment for Snowflake agent impossible due to template variable {{agent 1_string_true}} instead of actual output. Cannot validate syntax, internal consistency, or well-formedness without concrete content. Score: 0 due to missing input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,0,N/A,"Correctness assessment for PySpark agent impossible due to template variable {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual output. Cannot validate syntax, internal consistency, or well-formedness without concrete content. Score: 0 due to missing input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score computed as average of individual agent scores: (0 + 0) / 2 = 0. Both agents received 0 due to missing actual outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Critical input validation failure detected. To resolve: 1) Replace template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} with actual agent outputs, 2) Ensure both outputs are complete and properly formatted, 3) Verify all runtime parameters are correctly substituted, 4) Re-run comparison with valid inputs. Current state prevents any meaningful analysis or scoring."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"For future runs: Implement input validation to detect unresolved template variables before analysis begins. Add error handling for missing or malformed inputs. Consider adding content type detection to ensure appropriate comparison strategies are applied."
