Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the Snowflake SQL stored procedure sp_Order_Detail. Agent 1 provided structured documentation with clear sections and bullet points, while Agent 2 delivered more detailed analysis with markdown formatting and additional technical insights. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the requirements and deliver enterprise-grade documentation suitable for data warehousing contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core purpose: documenting a Snowflake stored procedure for order analysis. They share identical understanding of the business problem (customer order behavior analysis), technical components (stored procedure, temporary tables, cursors), and data flow. Minor differences exist in emphasis and detail level, with Agent 2 providing more granular technical analysis and Agent 1 focusing on clearer structural presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-60","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with sections for Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Performance Optimization, and Technical Elements. However, Agent 1 uses a more concise bullet-point approach while Agent 2 employs detailed markdown formatting with subsections. Agent 2 includes additional sections like API Cost Calculation and more extensive complexity analysis that Agent 1 handles more briefly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 15-20, 45-50","Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and accurate technical details. Minor issues include some repetitive phrasing in the performance optimization section and could benefit from more specific line references in code analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,"Lines 25-30, 80-85","Agent 2 output demonstrates strong technical accuracy with proper markdown formatting and comprehensive coverage. Minor issues include inconsistent formatting in some bullet points and occasional verbose explanations that could be more concise. The API cost section adds value but breaks from the main documentation flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical information, proper formatting, and comprehensive coverage of the Snowflake stored procedure documentation requirements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,"Lines 1-10, 30-40","Maintain the clear, structured approach with bullet points as it enhances readability. Consider adding more specific code line references and expanding the complexity analysis section to match the depth provided by Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,"Lines 60-70, 90-100","Excellent comprehensive coverage and technical depth. Consider streamlining some verbose sections for better readability and ensure consistent formatting throughout. The API cost inclusion is valuable but could be better integrated into the main flow."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs successfully meet the documentation requirements. For future iterations, consider combining Agent 1's clear structure with Agent 2's technical depth. Standardize formatting approaches and ensure consistent section organization across all documentation deliverables."
