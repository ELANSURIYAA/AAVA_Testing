Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 both agents","Both agents provide comprehensive documentation for the Snowflake SQL stored procedure sp_Order_Detail. Agent1_Documentation delivers a structured technical document with clear sections and moderate detail. Agent2_Documentation provides more extensive coverage with deeper technical analysis, additional sections, and enhanced business context. Both correctly identify the procedure's purpose as customer order summarization over the past month."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15, 45-60","Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting the sp_Order_Detail stored procedure for customer order analysis. Both correctly identify the business purpose (customer order summarization), technical components (stored procedure, temporary table, cursor), and data flow. Minor semantic differences exist in emphasis - Agent2_Documentation provides more business context and enterprise alignment details, while Agent1_Documentation focuses more on technical implementation. The fundamental understanding and intent are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-300 overall structure","Both outputs follow similar high-level documentation structures with sections for Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Performance, etc. However, Agent2_Documentation includes additional sections like 'API Cost Calculation' and more detailed subsections. Agent1_Documentation uses a more concise structure with bullet points, while Agent2_Documentation employs more narrative formatting with enhanced technical depth. The core organizational flow is similar but with notable structural variations in presentation style and section granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Documentation,95,"Lines 20-25, 80-85","Agent1_Documentation demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper section headers, consistent formatting, and accurate technical references. Minor issues include some repetitive phrasing in the complexity analysis section and could benefit from more specific line number references in code discussions. All technical statements about Snowflake features, SQL components, and procedure functionality are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Documentation,98,"Lines 1-400 throughout","Agent2_Documentation shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive section coverage, consistent markdown formatting, and detailed technical accuracy. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet point alignments. All technical content is precise, including Snowflake-specific features, SQL syntax references, and performance considerations. The API cost calculation adds valuable context."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Documentation,,"Lines 1-300","Consider expanding business context sections to match the depth provided by Agent2_Documentation. Add more specific technical details about Snowflake features and include cost considerations. Enhance the complexity analysis with more granular metrics and improve cross-referencing between sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Documentation,,"Lines 1-400","Maintain the comprehensive approach while ensuring consistency in formatting across all sections. The detailed coverage and business alignment are exemplary. Consider standardizing bullet point formatting for enhanced readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Overall comparison","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency in documenting Snowflake SQL procedures. Agent2_Documentation provides superior depth and business context, making it more suitable for enterprise documentation standards. Agent1_Documentation offers good technical coverage but could benefit from enhanced business alignment and additional technical details. For production use, recommend combining Agent1's concise technical focus with Agent2's comprehensive business context."
