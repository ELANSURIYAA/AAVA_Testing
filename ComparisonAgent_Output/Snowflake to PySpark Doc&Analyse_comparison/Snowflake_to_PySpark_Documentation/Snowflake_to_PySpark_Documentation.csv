Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the Snowflake SQL stored procedure 'sp_Order_Detail'. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with both addressing the same business problem of analyzing customer order data over the past month. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with both following similar documentation frameworks, though with some organizational differences. Correctness scores are high for both agents (Snowflake_Documentation_Agent1: 95/100, Snowflake_Documentation_Agent2: 93/100) with minor formatting and reference inconsistencies. Overall assessment shows both outputs are of high quality with Agent1 having slight advantages in consistency and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Both outputs address the identical core purpose: documenting a Snowflake stored procedure that processes customer order data for the past month. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Same business problem identification - customer order analysis and insights, (2) Identical technical components - stored procedure, temporary tables, cursor iteration, (3) Same data flow logic - filter past month orders, aggregate by customer, print summaries, (4) Aligned business benefits - customer segmentation, trend analysis, decision support. Minor semantic differences: Agent2 uses more technical terminology ('ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting') and includes API cost details, while Agent1 focuses more on enterprise alignment aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs follow similar documentation frameworks with these structural alignments: (1) Overview section covering purpose and business alignment, (2) Code Structure and Design section, (3) Data Flow and Processing Logic section, (4) Performance Optimization section, (5) Technical Elements section, (6) Complexity Analysis section. Key structural differences: Agent1 uses more traditional headings and bullet points (lines 15-25), while Agent2 employs markdown formatting with numbered lists (lines 20-30). Agent2 includes additional subsections like 'API Cost Calculation' (line 180) not present in Agent1. Section ordering is mostly consistent but Agent2 reorganizes some technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Documentation_Agent1,95,"Lines 45, 78, 92","High correctness with minor issues: (1) Consistent internal references throughout document, (2) Proper section numbering and hierarchy, (3) Accurate technical terminology usage. Minor deductions: Line 45 - missing closing quote in complexity score explanation, Line 78 - inconsistent bullet point formatting in performance section, Line 92 - minor spacing issue in data mapping section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Documentation_Agent2,93,"Lines 52, 95, 165","High correctness with some formatting inconsistencies: (1) Proper markdown formatting throughout, (2) Consistent technical terminology, (3) Accurate cross-references. Minor deductions: Line 52 - inconsistent capitalization in section headers, Line 95 - missing period in complexity analysis, Line 165 - formatting inconsistency in error handling section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong internal consistency and proper documentation structure with only minor formatting and punctuation issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_Documentation_Agent1,,"Lines 45, 78, 92","Strengths: Excellent enterprise focus and business alignment discussion. Clear section organization and consistent formatting. Comprehensive coverage of all technical aspects. Improvements: Fix minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points (line 78), correct quote closure in complexity section (line 45), standardize spacing in data mapping (line 92)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_Documentation_Agent2,,"Lines 52, 95, 165","Strengths: Superior markdown formatting and technical depth. Excellent inclusion of API cost details and specific technical metrics. Strong performance optimization discussion. Improvements: Standardize section header capitalization (line 52), add missing punctuation in complexity analysis (line 95), fix formatting consistency in error handling section (line 165). Consider reducing technical jargon for broader audience accessibility."
