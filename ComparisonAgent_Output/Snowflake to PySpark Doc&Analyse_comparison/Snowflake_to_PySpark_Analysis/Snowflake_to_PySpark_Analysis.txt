# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Snowflake stored procedures with strong semantic alignment (85/100). **Snowflake_Analysis** focuses on business objectives and complexity metrics, while **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails** provides more detailed technical implementation analysis. Structural approaches differ significantly (65/100) with Snowflake_Analysis using tabular metrics and Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails using numbered sections. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and consistent internal references. **Overall assessment: 83/100** - Strong analytical coverage with complementary perspectives.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs analyze the same `sp_Order_Detail` stored procedure with aligned business objectives. **Snowflake_Analysis** emphasizes customer order behavior analysis and business insights (lines 4-5), while **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails** focuses on generating customer summaries over past month (lines 3-4). Core analytical intent is highly similar with 85% semantic overlap. Minor divergence in emphasis: Snowflake_Analysis prioritizes business metrics while Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails emphasizes technical implementation details.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Structural approaches differ significantly. **Snowflake_Analysis** uses tabular complexity metrics format (lines 8-15) followed by syntax analysis sections. **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails** employs numbered sections (1-8) with subsection headers. Both include complexity metrics, syntax analysis, and optimization recommendations but organize them differently. Snowflake_Analysis: 6 main sections, Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails: 8 numbered sections. Flow similarity is moderate at 65% due to different organizational paradigms.

### Correctness

**Snowflake_Analysis (Score: 100/100):** Output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, valid metric calculations (30 lines, 2 aggregate functions), and accurate Snowflake syntax references. All internal references are consistent and properly formatted. No syntax errors or broken references detected.

**Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails (Score: 100/100):** Output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, accurate complexity metrics (40 lines, 2 aggregate functions), and valid SQL code examples. All internal references are consistent, table formatting is proper, and code blocks are correctly formatted. No syntax errors detected.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100** - Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Snowflake_Analysis | Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails | Overall |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 65 | 65 | 65 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **83** | **83** | **83** |

## Recommendations

### For Snowflake_Analysis
- Strengthen structural organization by adopting numbered sections for better navigation
- Consider expanding technical implementation details to match depth of Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails analysis
- Add complete script content section for comprehensive reference

### For Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails
- Enhance business objective emphasis to match Snowflake_Analysis clarity
- Consider adding tabular complexity metrics for quick reference
- Improve optimization recommendations section with more specific performance strategies and cost considerations

### For Both Outputs
Both outputs would benefit from:
1. Standardized structural format combining numbered sections with tabular metrics
2. Balanced coverage of business objectives and technical implementation
3. Consistent complexity scoring methodology
4. Enhanced cross-referencing between sections for better navigation
