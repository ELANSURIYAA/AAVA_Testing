Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of a Snowflake stored procedure 'sp_Order_Detail' that processes monthly order data. Agent 1 presents a structured technical analysis with clear metrics and optimization recommendations. Agent 2 provides a more detailed session-based analysis with complete script content and enhanced procedural explanations. Both outputs cover similar analytical dimensions but with different organizational approaches and depth levels."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs analyze the same Snowflake stored procedure with identical business objectives: processing monthly order data and calculating customer summaries. Core concepts are aligned including temporary table usage, cursor iteration, aggregation functions, and optimization needs. Minor differences exist in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses more on metrics quantification while Agent 2 provides more procedural context and complete script reproduction."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs follow analytical report structure with overview, complexity metrics, syntax analysis, and optimization sections. Agent 1 uses a more compact tabular format for metrics (lines 5-12) while Agent 2 uses expanded descriptive format (lines 8-15). Agent 1 has 6 main sections while Agent 2 has 8 sections including session identifier and complete script content. Flow and logical progression are similar but organizational granularity differs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analysis,95,"Lines 5-12, 20-25","Syntax and structure are correct. Complexity metrics are accurate (30 lines, 1 table, 2 aggregates). Minor issue: states 'None' for joins and conditional logic but cursor loop represents conditional logic. Optimization recommendations are technically sound and appropriate for Snowflake environment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Session,98,"Lines 8-15, 35-75","Highly accurate analysis with correct complexity metrics (40 lines, 2 tables including temp table, 3 DML statements). Properly identifies JavaScript language usage and Snowflake-specific syntax patterns. Complete script content is syntactically valid. Minor inconsistency in line count estimation but overall technical accuracy is excellent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with proper identification of Snowflake features, complexity metrics, and optimization opportunities. Agent 2 shows slightly higher precision in technical details and script completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analysis,,"Lines 20-30","Strengthen conditional logic identification and provide more detailed script examples. Consider expanding optimization techniques section with specific Snowflake clustering and partitioning strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Session,,"Lines 25-35","Maintain current level of technical detail and script completeness. Consider adding more quantitative complexity scoring rationale and cross-referencing optimization techniques with specific code sections."
