Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-30 (Snowflake_Analysis), Lines 1-40 (Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails)","Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Snowflake stored procedures with strong semantic alignment (85/100). Snowflake_Analysis focuses on business objectives and complexity metrics, while Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails provides more detailed technical implementation analysis. Structural approaches differ significantly (65/100) with Snowflake_Analysis using tabular metrics and Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails using numbered sections. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and consistent internal references. Overall assessment: 83/100 - Strong analytical coverage with complementary perspectives."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-5 (both outputs)","Both outputs analyze the same sp_Order_Detail stored procedure with aligned business objectives. Snowflake_Analysis emphasizes customer order behavior analysis and business insights (lines 4-5), while Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails focuses on generating customer summaries over past month (lines 3-4). Core analytical intent is highly similar with 85% semantic overlap. Minor divergence in emphasis: Snowflake_Analysis prioritizes business metrics while Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails emphasizes technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 6-25 (Snowflake_Analysis), Lines 8-35 (Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails)","Structural approaches differ significantly. Snowflake_Analysis uses tabular complexity metrics format (lines 8-15) followed by syntax analysis sections. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails employs numbered sections (1-8) with subsection headers. Both include complexity metrics, syntax analysis, and optimization recommendations but organize them differently. Snowflake_Analysis: 6 main sections, Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails: 8 numbered sections. Flow similarity is moderate at 65% due to different organizational paradigms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Analysis,100,"Lines 1-30","Output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, valid metric calculations (30 lines, 2 aggregate functions), and accurate Snowflake syntax references. All internal references are consistent and properly formatted. No syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails,100,"Lines 1-40","Output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, accurate complexity metrics (40 lines, 2 aggregate functions), and valid SQL code examples. All internal references are consistent, table formatting is proper, and code blocks are correctly formatted. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"All lines","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and accurate technical details. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_Analysis,N/A,"Lines 20-25","Strengthen structural organization by adopting numbered sections for better navigation. Consider expanding technical implementation details to match depth of Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails analysis. Add complete script content section for comprehensive reference."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails,N/A,"Lines 15-30","Enhance business objective emphasis to match Snowflake_Analysis clarity. Consider adding tabular complexity metrics for quick reference. Improve optimization recommendations section with more specific performance strategies and cost considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized structural format combining numbered sections with tabular metrics, 2) Balanced coverage of business objectives and technical implementation, 3) Consistent complexity scoring methodology, 4) Enhanced cross-referencing between sections for better navigation."
