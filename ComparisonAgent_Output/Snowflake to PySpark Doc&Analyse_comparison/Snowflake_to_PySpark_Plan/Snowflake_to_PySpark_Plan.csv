Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. The input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not populated with actual agent outputs. A valid comparison requires the actual content from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meaning, intent, and purpose of both outputs to determine alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, organization, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent output content instead of template variables. 2. Ensure both agent outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Re-run the comparison analysis once valid inputs are available. 4. Verify that the agent outputs relate to Snowflake to PySpark migration planning as indicated by the file path."
