Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Input contains placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual agent outputs. Without the actual content from both agents, semantic, structural, and correctness analysis cannot be performed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no actual output provided, only placeholder {{agent 1_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no actual output provided, only placeholder {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure both agent outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Verify that the comparison task includes clear requirements and context. 4. Re-run the comparison once actual outputs are available."
