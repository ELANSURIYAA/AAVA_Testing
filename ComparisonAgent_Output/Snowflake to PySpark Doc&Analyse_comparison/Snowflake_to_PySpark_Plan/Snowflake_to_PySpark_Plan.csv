Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent_1_Output presents a more structured format with clear sections and bullet points, while Agent_2_Output provides more detailed technical explanations and includes complete code references. Both outputs address the same core requirements: PySpark runtime costs, code fixing effort, and API costs. Key differences include presentation style, level of technical detail, and cost calculation methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: cost estimation for PySpark runtime, effort estimation for code migration, and API cost calculation. Agent_1_Output estimates total cost at $96.80 while Agent_2_Output estimates $11.84, showing significant variance in cost calculation methodology. Both identify similar cost drivers (data volume, cluster size, runtime) and effort categories (syntax fixes, logic adjustments, validation). The semantic intent and purpose are highly aligned despite different calculation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Agent_1_Output uses a numbered list structure (1, 2, 3) with clear subsections and bullet points. Agent_2_Output uses a similar numbered structure but includes more detailed subsections with markdown formatting and code blocks. Both follow the same logical flow: Cost Estimation → Code Fixing Effort → API Cost. Agent_2_Output includes additional structural elements like complete code references and more granular breakdowns, making it more comprehensive but less concise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 1-25,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent bullet points, and clear numerical calculations. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in cost breakdowns and lack of detailed justification for some estimates. All mathematical calculations are internally consistent and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,Lines 1-50,"Agent_2_Output shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent code block syntax, and detailed technical explanations. All calculations are well-documented with clear justifications. The inclusion of complete code references and detailed technical specifications demonstrates high attention to syntactic accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_2_Output slightly edges out with more comprehensive documentation and detailed technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Consider providing more detailed justifications for cost calculations and effort estimates. Include more granular breakdowns of compute vs storage costs. Add technical specifications and code references to support estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider condensing some technical details for executive summary purposes. The detailed approach is valuable but could benefit from a more concise summary section for stakeholder communication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized cost calculation methodologies to ensure consistency. Consider establishing common baseline assumptions for cluster configurations and runtime estimates. Agent_2_Output's detailed approach could be combined with Agent_1_Output's concise presentation style for optimal results."
