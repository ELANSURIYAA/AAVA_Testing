Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent 2 demonstrates superior structural organization with clearer section delineation and more detailed technical breakdown. Both outputs are syntactically correct with minor formatting differences. Agent 2 provides more granular cost calculations and better justification for effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Snowflake to PySpark migration. They cover identical key areas: runtime costs, testing effort, and API costs. However, Agent 2 provides more detailed technical explanations and better cost breakdowns, while Agent 1 uses simpler calculations. The semantic intent is highly aligned with differences in depth and technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow a three-section structure (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost). Agent 2 uses clearer markdown formatting with better section separation and subsection organization. Agent 1 uses a more compact format with bullet points, while Agent 2 employs hierarchical structure with detailed subsections. The logical flow is similar but presentation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting. Minor issue: inconsistent use of currency formatting and some calculations could be more explicit (e.g., storage cost proration not clearly explained)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-100,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, clear section headers, and consistent formatting throughout. Very minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point alignment but otherwise exemplary structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper formatting and structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Improve structural organization by adding clearer section headers and subsection breakdowns. Enhance cost calculation transparency by showing intermediate steps and assumptions more explicitly."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Maintain current high-quality structure and detailed analysis approach. Consider adding executive summary section for quick reference. Minor formatting consistency improvements in bullet point alignment."
