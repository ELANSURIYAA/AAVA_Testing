Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent1), Lines 1-120 (Agent2)","Both outputs address Snowflake to PySpark migration cost estimation with similar three-section structure. Agent2 provides more comprehensive analysis with detailed technical explanations and code references, while Agent1 offers concise calculations. Key differences: Agent1 estimates $96.80 total cost vs Agent2's $11.84 compute cost; Agent1 estimates 22 hours effort vs Agent2's 13-15 hours. Both include API costs (~$0.002). Agent2 includes complete Snowflake procedure and PySpark environment details for better context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-25, Lines 16-35 vs 26-80, Lines 36-50 vs 81-120","Both outputs target the same migration analysis goal with identical three-section structure (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing Effort, API Cost). However, significant divergence in cost calculation methodology: Agent1 includes monthly storage costs ($92) in job cost while Agent2 focuses on compute-only costs. Agent1 uses simpler aggregated approach while Agent2 provides granular DBU calculations and technical justifications. Both identify same cost drivers (data volume, cluster size, runtime) but apply different calculation models."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-120","Nearly identical high-level structure with three main sections in same order. Both use numbered sections (1, 2, 3) with consistent subsection organization. Agent2 expands each section with additional technical detail and includes complete code references, but maintains the same logical flow. Minor structural differences: Agent2 uses markdown formatting and includes horizontal separators, while Agent1 uses plain text formatting. Both conclude with summary sections containing same key metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,88,"Lines 5-8, 12-14, 20-25","Syntax and internal consistency are good. Cost calculations are mathematically correct (4 nodes × $0.60/hour × 2 hours = $4.80). However, mixing monthly storage costs ($92) with hourly job costs creates logical inconsistency. Effort estimates are well-structured with clear breakdowns. Minor issue: API cost precision inconsistent with other figures (shows $0.0023 vs rounded dollars elsewhere)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-55, 85-95","Excellent syntax and internal consistency throughout. All calculations are mathematically sound with proper DBU cost breakdown (16 DBUs × $0.22 × 2 hours = $7.04). Consistent cost methodology focusing on compute costs. Well-formatted code blocks with proper syntax. Minor deduction for slight inconsistency in API cost ($0.0020 vs $0.002 in summary)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,"N/A","Average correctness score: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92. Both outputs demonstrate strong internal consistency with proper mathematical calculations and logical structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,"Lines 5-14","Clarify cost calculation methodology by separating one-time job costs from ongoing storage costs. Consider providing DBU-level breakdown for transparency. Align API cost precision with other financial figures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,"Lines 1-120","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding storage cost considerations for complete cost picture. Minor formatting consistency improvements for API cost representation across sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-120","Both outputs would benefit from standardized cost calculation methodology. Agent2's approach with detailed technical context and code references provides superior analytical depth. Consider combining Agent1's conciseness with Agent2's technical rigor for optimal output."
