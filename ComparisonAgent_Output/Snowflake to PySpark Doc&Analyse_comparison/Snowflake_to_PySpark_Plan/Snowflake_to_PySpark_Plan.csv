Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Output1 presents a more structured, concise approach with clear cost breakdowns, while Output2 offers more detailed technical context and justifications. Both address the same core requirements but with different levels of granularity and presentation styles."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical migration analysis requirements: cost estimation, effort calculation, and API costs. They share the same fundamental understanding of the task - analyzing PySpark runtime costs, code fixing effort, and validation requirements. Minor differences in emphasis and detail level but core semantic intent is highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-20, 25-40 (both outputs)","Both follow similar three-section structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost. Output1 uses numbered sections with bullet points, while Output2 uses headers with detailed subsections. Flow and logical decomposition are comparable but presentation formats differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,95,"Lines 5-15","Well-formed structure with clear cost calculations. Minor issue: storage cost calculation mixing monthly and job-duration costs without clear prorating methodology (line 8-9)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,92,"Lines 20-25, 45-50","Comprehensive technical details with proper calculations. Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost breakdown presentation (lines 20-25) and some redundant explanations in validation section (lines 45-50)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor presentation and calculation methodology issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Improve storage cost prorating methodology and clarify monthly vs. job-duration cost calculations for better accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Streamline redundant explanations and standardize cost breakdown formatting for improved clarity and conciseness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Consider combining Output1's concise structure with Output2's technical depth for optimal migration analysis documentation."
