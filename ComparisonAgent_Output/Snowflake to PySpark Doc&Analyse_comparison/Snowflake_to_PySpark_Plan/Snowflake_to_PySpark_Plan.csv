Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent_1 presents a more concise format with clear cost breakdowns ($96.80 total runtime cost, 22 hours effort), while Agent_2 provides more detailed technical explanations with slightly different calculations ($11.84 compute cost, 13-15 hours effort). Both outputs address the same core requirements but differ in depth of technical detail and cost calculation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address identical migration analysis requirements with similar intent and purpose. Agent_1 focuses on high-level cost summary while Agent_2 provides granular technical breakdown. Both cover PySpark runtime costs, code fixing effort, and API costs. Semantic alignment is strong despite different presentation styles and calculation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar three-section structure: (1) Cost Estimation, (2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort, (3) API Cost Calculation. Agent_1 uses numbered sections with bullet points, while Agent_2 uses markdown headers with detailed subsections. Agent_2 includes additional technical context and complete code references that Agent_1 omits. Overall flow is comparable but presentation depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8-9,"Agent_1 output is syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting and clear numerical calculations. Minor issue: Storage cost calculation methodology could be clearer regarding prorated monthly costs for job duration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,N/A,"Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, and comprehensive code examples. All calculations are clearly explained with step-by-step breakdowns. No significant syntax or formatting issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs maintain high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and clear presentation. Agent_2 slightly superior due to more comprehensive technical documentation and clearer calculation methodologies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-20,"Consider expanding technical detail and providing step-by-step calculation breakdowns similar to Agent_2. Include complete code context and more granular cost factor analysis to improve comprehensiveness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider condensing some technical details for executive summary purposes while maintaining the thorough technical documentation for implementation teams."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Standardized cost calculation methodology, (2) Consistent effort estimation units and ranges, (3) Cross-validation of numerical results to ensure accuracy alignment."
