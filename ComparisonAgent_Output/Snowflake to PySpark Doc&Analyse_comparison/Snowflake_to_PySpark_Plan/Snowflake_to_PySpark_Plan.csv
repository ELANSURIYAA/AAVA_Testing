Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent_2 delivers more detailed technical breakdown with specific DBU calculations and structured approach, while Agent_1 provides concise estimates. Key differences include cost calculations ($96.80 vs $11.84), effort estimates (22 vs 13-15 hours), and level of technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,All,"Both outputs address the same core requirements: cost estimation, code fixing effort, and API costs. Agent_1 focuses on storage costs prominently ($92 monthly), while Agent_2 emphasizes compute costs with detailed DBU breakdowns. Both recognize syntax translation challenges and validation needs, but with different emphasis on procedural vs set-based operations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs follow identical three-section structure: 1) Cost Estimation, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation, 3) API Cost Calculation. Agent_2 provides more granular subsections and detailed technical breakdowns within each section, while Agent_1 maintains simpler organization with clear cost summaries."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-35,"Syntactically correct with proper formatting and calculations. Minor issue: storage cost calculation assumes full monthly cost ($92) rather than prorated for job duration, though this is acknowledged in the text."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-89,"Highly accurate with detailed technical specifications, proper cost calculations, and comprehensive code examples. Includes complete Snowflake procedure and PySpark environment details for reference."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct with proper formatting. Agent_2 provides more technical accuracy and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider providing more detailed DBU calculations and breaking down compute vs storage costs more clearly. The $92 storage cost assumption needs clarification on prorating."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent technical depth and accuracy. Consider adding executive summary section for quick reference. The detailed code examples are valuable for implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from risk assessment section and contingency planning. Consider adding performance optimization recommendations and cost monitoring strategies."
