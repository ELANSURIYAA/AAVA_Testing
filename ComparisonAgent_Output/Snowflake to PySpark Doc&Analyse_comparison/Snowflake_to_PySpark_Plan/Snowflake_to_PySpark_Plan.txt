# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent 2 demonstrates superior structural organization with clearer section delineation and more detailed technical breakdown. Both outputs are syntactically correct with minor formatting differences. Agent 2 provides more granular cost calculations and better justification for effort estimates.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Snowflake to PySpark migration. They cover identical key areas: runtime costs, testing effort, and API costs. However, Agent 2 provides more detailed technical explanations and better cost breakdowns (lines 10-30), while Agent 1 uses simpler calculations (lines 5-15). The semantic intent is highly aligned with differences in depth and technical detail.

Key similarities:
- Both estimate ~$96.80 vs $11.84 for runtime costs (different calculation approaches)
- Both provide effort estimates: 22 hours vs 13-15 hours
- Both include API costs: $0.0023 vs $0.0020
- Both address the same technical challenges in migration

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs follow a three-section structure (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost). Agent 2 uses clearer markdown formatting with better section separation and subsection organization (lines 1-20). Agent 1 uses a more compact format with bullet points (lines 1-10), while Agent 2 employs hierarchical structure with detailed subsections. The logical flow is similar but presentation differs significantly.

Structural differences:
- Agent 2 uses proper markdown headers and formatting
- Agent 1 uses numbered sections with bullet points
- Agent 2 includes more detailed subsections and explanations
- Both maintain logical progression through the analysis

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**: Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting. Minor issue: inconsistent use of currency formatting and some calculations could be more explicit (lines 15-20), such as storage cost proration not clearly explained.

**Agent 2 (Score: 98/100)**: Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, clear section headers, and consistent formatting throughout. Very minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point alignment but otherwise exemplary structure.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **86** | **86** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1**: Improve structural organization by adding clearer section headers and subsection breakdowns (lines 1-25). Enhance cost calculation transparency by showing intermediate steps and assumptions more explicitly.

**For Agent 2**: Maintain current high-quality structure and detailed analysis approach. Consider adding executive summary section for quick reference. Minor formatting consistency improvements in bullet point alignment.
