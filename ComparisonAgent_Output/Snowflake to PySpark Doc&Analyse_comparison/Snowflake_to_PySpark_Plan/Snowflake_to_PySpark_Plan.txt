# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Snowflake to PySpark migration. Agent_2 delivers more detailed technical breakdown with specific DBU calculations and structured approach, while Agent_1 provides concise estimates. Key differences include cost calculations ($96.80 vs $11.84), effort estimates (22 vs 13-15 hours), and level of technical detail.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 82/100)

Both outputs address the same core requirements: cost estimation, code fixing effort, and API costs. Agent_1 focuses on storage costs prominently ($92 monthly), while Agent_2 emphasizes compute costs with detailed DBU breakdowns. Both recognize syntax translation challenges and validation needs, but with different emphasis on procedural vs set-based operations.

**Key Semantic Differences:**
- Agent_1 emphasizes storage costs as a major component ($92 monthly)
- Agent_2 focuses on compute costs with detailed DBU calculations ($11.84 total)
- Different approaches to effort estimation methodology
- Varying levels of technical detail in transformation analysis

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow identical three-section structure:
1. Cost Estimation
2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation  
3. API Cost Calculation

Agent_2 provides more granular subsections and detailed technical breakdowns within each section, while Agent_1 maintains simpler organization with clear cost summaries.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Identical high-level organization
- Both include cost-driving factors analysis
- Similar effort breakdown approaches
- Consistent API cost reporting format

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 95/100):**
Syntactically correct with proper formatting and calculations. Minor issue: storage cost calculation assumes full monthly cost ($92) rather than prorated for job duration, though this is acknowledged in the text.

**Agent_2 (Score: 98/100):**
Highly accurate with detailed technical specifications, proper cost calculations, and comprehensive code examples. Includes complete Snowflake procedure and PySpark environment details for reference.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 82 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 88 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **87** | **89** | **88** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:**
Consider providing more detailed DBU calculations and breaking down compute vs storage costs more clearly. The $92 storage cost assumption needs clarification on prorating.

**For Agent_2:**
Excellent technical depth and accuracy. Consider adding executive summary section for quick reference. The detailed code examples are valuable for implementation.

**For Both:**
Both outputs would benefit from risk assessment section and contingency planning. Consider adding performance optimization recommendations and cost monitoring strategies.
