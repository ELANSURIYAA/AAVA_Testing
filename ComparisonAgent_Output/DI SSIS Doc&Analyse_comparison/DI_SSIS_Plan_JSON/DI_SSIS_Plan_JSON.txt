# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs address SSIS to Spark migration cost and effort estimation but with significant differences in specificity and accuracy. Output 1 provides generic estimates while Output 2 offers detailed, context-specific calculations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating PySpark runtime costs and code fixing efforts for SSIS migration. However, Output 2 provides more specific context with actual table names (LossBodyParts, DimClaim) and realistic cost calculations, while Output 1 uses generic placeholders and inflated estimates.

**Key Differences:**
- Output 1: Generic "$2000 per month for medium-sized cluster"
- Output 2: Calculated "8 executors * 2.5 hours * $0.27 = $5.40"
- Output 1: Total effort 160 hours vs Output 2: 60 hours
- Output 2 includes specific business context with table names

### Structural Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Nearly identical JSON structure with same sections: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation, and API Cost. Both follow the same hierarchical organization and field naming conventions.

**Structure Analysis:**
- Identical top-level sections (1, 2, 3)
- Same nested hierarchy for cluster configuration
- Consistent field naming patterns
- Minor differences only in content specificity

### Correctness

**Output 1 (Score: 85/100)**
- Valid JSON syntax but contains unrealistic estimates
- Generic placeholders reduce practical value
- Time estimates appear inflated (6 hours total vs 3.5 hours in Output 2)

**Output 2 (Score: 98/100)**
- Valid JSON syntax with realistic, calculated estimates
- Specific context with actual table names
- Proper cost calculation methodology
- Minor issue: Unicode characters in data volume field

**Overall Correctness: 92/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Output1 | Output2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 95 |
| Correctness | 85 | 98 | 92 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For Output 1:**
- Replace generic estimates with calculated values based on actual cluster configurations and data volumes
- Provide specific context and realistic time estimates

**For Output 2:**
- Fix Unicode character encoding in data volume fields
- Consider adding more detailed breakdown of cost components for better transparency

**For Both:**
- Standardize cost calculation methodology and ensure all estimates are based on realistic scenarios rather than generic placeholders
