Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs address SSIS to Spark migration cost and effort estimation but with significant differences in specificity and accuracy. Output 1 provides generic estimates while Output 2 offers detailed, context-specific calculations.",
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating PySpark runtime costs and code fixing efforts for SSIS migration. However, Output 2 provides more specific context with actual table names (LossBodyParts, DimClaim) and realistic cost calculations, while Output 1 uses generic placeholders and inflated estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Nearly identical JSON structure with same sections: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation, and API Cost. Both follow the same hierarchical organization and field naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,85,"Lines 15-20, 25-30","Valid JSON syntax but contains unrealistic estimates ($2000/month vs actual $5.40 calculation) and generic placeholders. Time estimates appear inflated (6 hours total processing vs 3.5 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,98,"Lines 15-20, 25-30","Valid JSON syntax with realistic, calculated estimates. Specific context with actual table names and proper cost calculation methodology. Minor issue: Unicode characters in data volume field."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores (85 + 98) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Replace generic estimates with calculated values based on actual cluster configurations and data volumes. Provide specific context and realistic time estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Fix Unicode character encoding in data volume fields. Consider adding more detailed breakdown of cost components for better transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Standardize cost calculation methodology and ensure all estimates are based on realistic scenarios rather than generic placeholders."
