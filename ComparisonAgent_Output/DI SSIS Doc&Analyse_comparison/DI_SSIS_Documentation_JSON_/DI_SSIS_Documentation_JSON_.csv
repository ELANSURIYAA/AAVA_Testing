Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation of the EDW_CC_Load_LossBodyParts SSIS package with identical structural organization across 8 sections. Output_1 offers concise documentation with basic data mapping coverage, while Output_2 delivers extensive detail with comprehensive data mapping (10 vs 3 mappings) and broader dataset coverage (11 vs 3 datasets). Both maintain high technical accuracy and business context alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-10; 25-35; 45-55,"Both outputs address the same SSIS package documentation goal with aligned business purposes and technical understanding. Minor divergence in emphasis: Output_1 focuses on modularity and reusability, while Output_2 emphasizes traceability and incremental processing. Core semantic intent remains consistent across all sections."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-150,"Nearly identical structural organization with matching 8-section framework. Both follow consistent JSON schema with identical key naming conventions. Minor structural differences in data mapping array length (3 vs 10 entries) and complexity analysis details, but overall flow and decomposition approach are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,Lines 80-90,"Syntactically valid JSON with proper structure and consistent internal references. Minor issue: Limited data mapping coverage may not fully represent the actual SSIS package complexity, but no syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,Lines 1-150,"Fully valid JSON syntax with comprehensive and internally consistent data mappings. All field references, data types, and transformation logic are properly structured and aligned with SSIS best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average correctness score reflecting high syntactic validity across both outputs with comprehensive coverage in Output_2 compensating for Output_1's limited scope."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,Lines 45-65,"Expand data mapping section to include all 10+ field mappings present in the actual SSIS package for complete documentation coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 1-150,"Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adding performance metrics or execution time estimates to enhance operational value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 70-85,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical documentation capabilities. Output_2 provides superior completeness for production use, while Output_1 offers good foundational structure that could be enhanced with additional detail."
