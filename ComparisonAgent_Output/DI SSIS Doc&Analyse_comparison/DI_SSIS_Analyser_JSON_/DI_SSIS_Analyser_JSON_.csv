Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SSIS to PySpark migration analysis with nearly identical structure and content. The Generic_Analysis provides a template-like overview while EDW_CC_Load_LossBodyParts delivers specific package analysis. Key differences include data volume estimates, cost calculations, and effort estimations, but both maintain consistent analytical frameworks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical migration goals with same analytical framework. Minor differences in specific values (complexity scores 80 vs 72, effort hours 160 vs 60) and cost models ($2000/month vs $5.40 per run) reflect different scoping approaches but maintain semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Nearly identical 8-section structure with consistent subsection organization. Both follow same JSON schema with matching key hierarchies. Only structural difference is EDW_CC_Load_LossBodyParts includes specific package name wrapper while Generic_Analysis is direct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Generic_Analysis,98,"Lines 15, 45","Valid JSON syntax throughout. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity score notation (0–100 vs 0\u2013100) but structurally sound with proper nesting and data types."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,EDW_CC_Load_LossBodyParts,97,"Lines 20, 50, 120","Valid JSON with proper escaping. Unicode characters (\u2013, \u2014) used for dashes are correctly formatted. All brackets and braces properly matched."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper JSON formatting and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Generic_Analysis,,"Consider adding specific package identification and more granular cost breakdowns to match enterprise analysis standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,EDW_CC_Load_LossBodyParts,,"Excellent detailed analysis. Consider standardizing unicode character usage for consistency across different systems."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for SSIS migration planning. Recommend establishing standard templates to ensure consistency in complexity scoring and effort estimation methodologies."
