# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Comparison of two BigQuery unit testing outputs reveals significant disparity in quality and completeness. **Agent_1_Output** provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation framework. **Agent_2_Output** offers only a brief summary claiming 17 test cases but lacks actual content and implementation details, containing broken references to non-existent content.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 25/100)

Both outputs address BigQuery SQL unit testing concepts, but the semantic alignment is poor due to vastly different levels of detail and substance. Agent_1_Output provides specific test case descriptions (lines 1-10), expected outcomes, and clear testing objectives for scenarios like total spending calculation, customer tier assignment, and RFM scoring. Agent_2_Output mentions testing concepts but lacks concrete details and references non-existent comprehensive content ("See above for full details" on line 3), making semantic comparison difficult.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 15/100)

The structural approaches are fundamentally different. Agent_1_Output follows a well-organized format with:
- Numbered test cases (TC001-TC010) with consistent structure
- Detailed descriptions and expected outcomes
- Complete pytest script implementation (lines 15-80)

Agent_2_Output uses a brief summary format with minimal organization and incomplete references. The claimed "comprehensive test case list (TC01-TC17)" and "pytest script" are not actually provided, only referenced.

### Correctness

**Agent_1_Output: 95/100**
- Syntactically correct pytest code with proper imports (line 15-17)
- Proper BigQuery client initialization (line 20)
- Well-structured test functions with appropriate assertions
- Minor deduction for placeholder SQL comments that would need actual query implementation

**Agent_2_Output: 20/100**
- Contains broken references to non-existent content (line 3)
- Claims comprehensive test coverage but provides no verifiable implementation
- Incomplete and misleading content structure

**Overall Correctness: 58/100** (Average of individual scores)

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1_Output | Agent_2_Output | Overall |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 25 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Correctness | 95 | 20 | 58 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **33** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1_Output:**
- Excellent foundation with comprehensive test cases and proper pytest structure
- Complete SQL query implementations in placeholder comments (lines 22, 29, 36, etc.)
- Add data setup/teardown methods for more robust testing
- Consider adding integration test scenarios

**For Agent_2_Output:**
- Requires complete reconstruction from ground up
- Must provide actual test case implementations instead of summary claims
- Remove broken references to non-existent content
- Develop concrete pytest code with proper BigQuery integration
- Follow the structural pattern demonstrated in Agent_1_Output

The comparison reveals Agent_1_Output as significantly superior in all evaluation dimensions, providing a usable foundation for BigQuery unit testing while Agent_2_Output requires fundamental rework to be functional.
