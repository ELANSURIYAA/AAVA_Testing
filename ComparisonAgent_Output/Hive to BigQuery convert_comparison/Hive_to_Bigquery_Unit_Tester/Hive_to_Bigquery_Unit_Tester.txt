# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent 1 provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 detailed test cases (TC001-TC010) and complete pytest implementation. Agent 2 provides only a brief summary claiming 17 test cases but lacks detailed implementation. There is a significant disparity in completeness and implementation quality between the two outputs.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both outputs target BigQuery SQL testing and test case generation, maintaining similar intent. However, Agent 1 focuses on detailed test case specifications while Agent 2 claims broader coverage (17 vs 10 test cases) but provides minimal detail. The core semantic goal of test case generation is shared, but execution approaches differ significantly.

**Line References:** Lines 1-10 (Agent 1 test cases), Line 1 (Agent 2 summary)

### Structural Similarity (Score: 35/100)

Fundamentally different structural approaches. Agent 1 follows detailed documentation structure with explicit test case IDs, descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest implementation. Agent 2 uses summary format with minimal structural elements. Agent 1 has clear logical flow from test cases to implementation, while Agent 2 lacks implementable structure.

**Line References:** Lines 1-85 (Agent 1 structure), Lines 1-4 (Agent 2 structure)

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 90/100):** Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper imports, client initialization, and test function definitions. Minor issue: SQL query placeholders require actual implementation (lines 33, 40, 47, etc.). All Python syntax is valid, BigQuery client usage is appropriate, and test assertions are properly structured.

**Agent 2 (Score: 25/100):** Minimal content with no implementable code. Claims existence of comprehensive test cases and pytest script but provides no actual implementation. The summary format is syntactically valid as text but lacks any executable or verifiable components.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 58/100):** Average of Agent 1 (90) and Agent 2 (25) correctness scores.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 65 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 35 |
| Correctness | 90 | 25 | 58 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **53** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:** Complete the SQL query implementations in pytest functions (Lines 30-85). Replace placeholder comments with actual BigQuery SQL queries for each test case. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage.

**For Agent 2:** Provide the complete implementation claimed in the summary (Lines 1-4). Expand from summary format to detailed test case specifications and full pytest implementation. Include the 17 test cases mentioned and provide actual executable code rather than just claims.
