Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two distinct approaches to BigQuery unit testing were compared. Detailed_Test_Cases_Agent provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 specific test cases and complete pytest implementation, while Summary_Overview_Agent offers a high-level summary mentioning 17 test cases with setup/teardown methodology. The outputs show moderate semantic alignment (72/100) as both address database testing, but significant structural differences (45/100) due to different levels of detail and organization. Correctness scores are high for the detailed agent (95/100) and moderate for the summary agent (78/100) due to incomplete implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-10","Both outputs address unit testing for BigQuery/database operations with similar core concepts: test case validation, data handling, and query testing. However, Detailed_Test_Cases_Agent focuses on specific customer analytics scenarios (spending, tiers, RFM scoring) while Summary_Overview_Agent provides only high-level mentions of testing scope. The semantic intent aligns around database testing but diverges in specificity and domain focus."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-25 vs Lines 1-5","Significant structural differences exist. Detailed_Test_Cases_Agent follows a detailed specification format with numbered test cases, descriptions, expected outcomes, followed by complete pytest implementation. Summary_Overview_Agent uses a brief summary format with bullet points and incomplete code snippets. The logical flow differs substantially - one provides implementation-ready structure while the other offers conceptual overview."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Test_Cases_Agent,95,"Lines 26-50","The pytest script demonstrates proper BigQuery client initialization, query execution patterns, and assertion logic. Minor issues include placeholder comments for actual SQL queries and potential missing error handling for BigQuery connection failures. The test structure follows pytest conventions correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Summary_Overview_Agent,78,"Lines 6-10","The summary mentions key testing concepts correctly but lacks implementation details for validation. The API cost mention ($0.005) appears arbitrary without context. The reference to 17 test cases (TC01-TC17) is inconsistent with the detailed agent's 10 test cases (TC001-TC010), suggesting potential scope misalignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,87,,"Average correctness score reflecting the detailed implementation strength of one agent balanced against the incomplete but conceptually sound summary of the other."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Test_Cases_Agent,,"Enhance the pytest implementation by replacing placeholder SQL comments with actual query snippets. Add comprehensive error handling for BigQuery connection issues and query failures. Consider adding data setup and teardown methods for more robust testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Summary_Overview_Agent,,"Expand the summary to include specific test case details and complete implementation examples. Provide context for the API cost calculation and ensure test case numbering consistency. Add concrete pytest code examples to match the claimed setup/teardown methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Establish consistent test case identification schemes (TC001-TC010 vs TC01-TC17). Consider combining the detailed specification approach with the setup/teardown methodology mentioned in the summary. Align on the actual scope of test coverage to ensure both approaches address the same testing requirements."
