Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 (Agent 1), Lines 1-4 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 detailed test cases (TC001-TC010) and complete pytest implementation. Agent 2 provides only a brief summary claiming 17 test cases but lacks detailed implementation. Significant disparity in completeness and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-10 (Agent 1 test cases), Line 1 (Agent 2 summary)","Both outputs target BigQuery SQL testing and test case generation, maintaining similar intent. However, Agent 1 focuses on detailed test case specifications while Agent 2 claims broader coverage (17 vs 10 test cases) but provides minimal detail. The core semantic goal of test case generation is shared, but execution approaches differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,35,"Lines 1-85 (Agent 1 structure), Lines 1-4 (Agent 2 structure)","Fundamentally different structural approaches. Agent 1 follows detailed documentation structure with explicit test case IDs, descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest implementation. Agent 2 uses summary format with minimal structural elements. Agent 1 has clear logical flow from test cases to implementation, while Agent 2 lacks implementable structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,90,"Lines 30-85 (pytest code)","Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper imports, client initialization, and test function definitions. Minor issue: SQL query placeholders require actual implementation (lines 33, 40, 47, etc.). All Python syntax is valid, BigQuery client usage is appropriate, and test assertions are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,25,"Lines 1-4 (entire output)","Minimal content with no implementable code. Claims existence of comprehensive test cases and pytest script but provides no actual implementation. The summary format is syntactically valid as text but lacks any executable or verifiable components. No syntax errors in the brief text provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,58,,"Average of Agent 1 (90) and Agent 2 (25) correctness scores. Significant disparity due to Agent 1's complete implementation versus Agent 2's summary-only approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 30-85","Complete the SQL query implementations in pytest functions. Replace placeholder comments with actual BigQuery SQL queries for each test case. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 1-4","Provide the complete implementation claimed in the summary. Expand from summary format to detailed test case specifications and full pytest implementation. Include the 17 test cases mentioned and provide actual executable code rather than just claims."
