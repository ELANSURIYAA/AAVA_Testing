Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two BigQuery unit testing outputs. Agent_1_Output provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation. Agent_2_Output offers only a brief summary claiming 17 test cases but lacks actual content and implementation details. Significant disparity in completeness and usability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-3","Both outputs address BigQuery SQL unit testing but with vastly different levels of detail. Agent_1_Output provides specific test case descriptions, expected outcomes, and implementation guidance. Agent_2_Output mentions testing concepts but lacks concrete details and references non-existent content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Full structure vs Summary format","Agent_1_Output follows a structured format with numbered test cases, detailed descriptions, and complete code implementation. Agent_2_Output uses a brief summary format with minimal organization and incomplete references to detailed content that doesn't exist."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,"Lines 15-80","Syntactically correct pytest code with proper imports, BigQuery client initialization, and well-structured test functions. Minor deduction for placeholder SQL comments that would need actual query implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,20,"Lines 2-3","Contains broken references to non-existent content ('See above for full details'). Claims comprehensive test coverage but provides no actual implementation or verifiable content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,58,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 20) / 2 = 57.5, rounded to 58"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,N/A,"Excellent foundation with comprehensive test cases and proper pytest structure. Recommend completing SQL query implementations in placeholder comments and adding data setup/teardown methods."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,N/A,"Requires complete reconstruction. Must provide actual test case implementations, remove broken references, and develop concrete pytest code instead of summary claims."
