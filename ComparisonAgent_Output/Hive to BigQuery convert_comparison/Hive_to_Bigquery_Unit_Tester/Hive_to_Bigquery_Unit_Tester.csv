Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 vs Lines 1-4","Agent_1 provides comprehensive test case documentation with 10 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation. Agent_2 provides only a brief summary claiming 17 test cases but lacks actual implementation details. Significant gap in completeness and usability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-2","Both outputs target BigQuery SQL testing but Agent_1 provides specific test case descriptions while Agent_2 only mentions test case existence. Same domain but different levels of detail and actionability."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-85 vs Lines 1-4","Agent_1 follows structured format with numbered test cases and complete pytest script. Agent_2 lacks proper structure with only summary text. Fundamental difference in organization and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 11-85","Pytest script has proper imports and function structure but contains placeholder comments instead of actual SQL queries. Missing query implementations reduce practical usability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,25,"Lines 1-4","Output lacks actual implementation details, contains only summary text. No executable code or detailed test specifications provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,55,,"Average of Agent_1 (85) and Agent_2 (25). Significant disparity in implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 11-85","Replace placeholder comments with actual SQL query implementations. Add proper test data setup and teardown methods. Include parameterized tests for better coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 1-4","Provide complete test case implementations instead of summary. Add detailed test descriptions, expected outcomes, and executable pytest code to match claimed functionality."
