Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 and Agent 2 both provide test case documentation for Hive to BigQuery conversion validation, but with significantly different approaches and comprehensiveness. Agent 1 delivers 10 focused test cases with basic pytest implementation, while Agent 2 provides 17 comprehensive test cases with advanced pytest fixtures and broader coverage including performance, schema validation, and edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-17","Both outputs address Hive to BigQuery conversion testing with overlapping core objectives. Agent 1 focuses on specific query validation scenarios (TC001-TC010) while Agent 2 provides broader coverage including performance testing, schema validation, and manual intervention checks (TC01-TC17). The semantic intent is aligned but Agent 2 demonstrates more comprehensive understanding of conversion testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-80","Agent 1 uses simple numbered test case format with basic descriptions, while Agent 2 employs a structured tabular format with columns for Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, and Pass/Fail Status. The pytest implementations also differ significantly - Agent 1 provides basic test functions while Agent 2 includes sophisticated fixtures and setup/teardown logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,85,"Lines 25-50","Test case structure is valid with proper TC001-TC010 numbering. Pytest script has correct syntax but lacks proper fixtures and setup. Some test functions are incomplete with placeholder comments for SQL queries. No syntax errors but implementation is basic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 30-80","Comprehensive tabular test case format is well-structured and complete. Pytest script demonstrates advanced implementation with proper fixtures, client setup, dataset management, and teardown logic. Minor deduction for placeholder comments in some test implementations, but overall syntax and structure are excellent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores. Both outputs are syntactically correct with Agent 2 showing superior implementation completeness and best practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance test case documentation with tabular format including preconditions, test steps, and expected results. Improve pytest implementation with proper fixtures, client setup, and dataset management. Add more comprehensive coverage including performance, schema validation, and edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding more specific BigQuery syntax validation test cases similar to Agent 1's focused approach. Ensure all placeholder SQL queries are completed for full implementation readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Combine Agent 1's focused BigQuery-specific validation with Agent 2's comprehensive testing framework approach for optimal coverage. Both outputs would benefit from actual SQL query implementations rather than placeholder comments."
