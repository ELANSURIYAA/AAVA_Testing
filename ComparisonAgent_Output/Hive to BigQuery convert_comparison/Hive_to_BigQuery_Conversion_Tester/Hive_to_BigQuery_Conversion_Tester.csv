Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two comprehensive test case documents for Hive to BigQuery conversion validation were compared. Agent_2_Output provides more extensive coverage with 17 test cases (TC01-TC17) including performance, schema validation, and manual intervention testing, while Agent_1_Output focuses on 10 core functional test cases (TC001-TC010). Both outputs include pytest implementations but differ in structure and comprehensiveness. Agent_2_Output demonstrates superior technical depth and enterprise-grade testing approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1_Output), Lines 1-80 (Agent_2_Output)","Both outputs address the same core objective of validating Hive to BigQuery conversion through comprehensive test cases. However, Agent_2_Output expands the scope significantly with additional test cases covering performance (TC12), schema equivalence (TC02), partitioning recommendations (TC11), and manual interventions (TC13). Agent_1_Output focuses more narrowly on functional validation of specific query components like RFM scoring, seasonal patterns, and customer segmentation. The semantic alignment is strong but Agent_2_Output provides broader enterprise testing coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-100 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow a similar high-level structure: test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. However, Agent_1_Output uses a more narrative format with numbered test cases and detailed descriptions, while Agent_2_Output employs a structured table format with standardized columns (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, etc.). Agent_2_Output includes additional structural elements like fixtures for dataset management and more sophisticated test organization. The pytest implementations differ significantly in complexity and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,85,"Lines 45-100","The pytest script contains well-structured test functions with appropriate assertions. However, there are incomplete query placeholders (lines 52, 60, 68, etc.) marked with '-- Add the SQL query snippet for TC00X here' which would cause runtime failures. The test logic is sound where implemented, with proper BigQuery client initialization and result validation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,92,"Lines 60-150","The pytest implementation is more comprehensive with proper fixture management, dataset setup/teardown, and modular query execution. Contains some placeholder comments for actual data loading (line 95) but the overall structure is production-ready. Includes sophisticated test patterns like performance testing and schema validation that demonstrate advanced testing practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Agent_2_Output shows superior technical implementation while Agent_1_Output has structural completeness issues with placeholder queries."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"1. Complete the placeholder SQL queries in the pytest script to make tests executable. 2. Add more comprehensive test cases covering edge cases and performance scenarios. 3. Implement proper dataset fixtures for test isolation. 4. Consider adding schema validation and data type conversion tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"1. Fill in the actual data loading implementation in the load_test_data fixture. 2. Complete the placeholder test implementations marked with '...' 3. Add more specific assertions for complex business logic validation. 4. Consider adding integration tests for end-to-end validation workflows."
