Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive test case documents for BigQuery validation with pytest implementations. Agent_1 focuses on customer analytics validation with 10 test cases while Agent_2 addresses Hive-to-BigQuery conversion testing with 17 test cases. The outputs show moderate semantic alignment as both target BigQuery testing but with different scopes. Structural similarity is high due to consistent test case formatting and pytest structure. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-50 Agent_1 Lines 1-80 Agent_2","Both outputs address BigQuery testing but with different primary focuses. Agent_1 concentrates on customer analytics validation including RFM scoring customer tiers and seasonal patterns. Agent_2 focuses on Hive-to-BigQuery conversion validation including schema equivalence aggregate logic and performance testing. While both share common BigQuery testing concepts the semantic intent differs significantly - customer analytics vs migration validation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10 both agents","Both outputs follow highly similar structural patterns: numbered test cases with ID Description Preconditions Test Steps Expected Results and pytest script implementations. Agent_2 uses a more organized table format for test cases and includes additional sections like performance testing and manual intervention validation. The pytest structure is nearly identical with similar imports fixtures and test function patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 45-120","Agent_1 pytest script has proper Python syntax correct BigQuery client initialization and valid test function structure. Minor issue: placeholder comments for SQL queries need actual implementation. All imports are correct and test assertions are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 85-180","Agent_2 pytest script demonstrates correct Python syntax and comprehensive test structure. Includes proper fixture setup for dataset management and more detailed test implementations. Minor issues: some placeholder comments for actual SQL queries and mock data loading implementation needed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper Python and documentation formatting. Minor deductions for incomplete SQL query implementations in pytest scripts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Complete SQL query implementations in pytest test functions. Add more comprehensive error handling and edge case validation. Consider adding performance benchmarks similar to Agent_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Implement actual mock data loading in fixtures. Complete placeholder SQL queries in test functions. Consider adding more specific customer analytics test cases from Agent_1 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents should integrate their complementary approaches - Agent_1 customer analytics focus with Agent_2 comprehensive conversion testing methodology. Standardize on table format for better readability. Implement complete end-to-end test data setup and teardown procedures."
