Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Test_Case_Document provides 10 focused test cases (TC001-TC010) with clear structure and pytest implementation. Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document delivers 17 comprehensive test cases (TC01-TC17) with enhanced coverage including performance, partitioning, and error handling. Both outputs are well-structured test case documents for BigQuery validation with functional pytest scripts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-80","Both outputs address Hive-to-BigQuery conversion testing with similar core objectives. Agent Test_Case_Document covers essential validation areas (calculations, exclusions, tiers, nulls, categories, patterns, RFM, limits) while Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document expands coverage to include schema validation, performance testing, partitioning recommendations, and error handling. The semantic intent is highly aligned but Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document provides broader scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30 vs 1-40","Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with numbered test cases and pytest implementations. Agent Test_Case_Document uses a narrative format with clear sections (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result). Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document uses a more structured table format with identical column headers. Both include pytest scripts with similar helper functions and test structure, though Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document includes additional fixtures and setup/teardown logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Case_Document,95,"Lines 45-120","Test case document is well-formed with consistent ID numbering (TC001-TC010), clear descriptions, and valid pytest syntax. Minor issue: some test functions have placeholder comments '-- Add the SQL query snippet' instead of actual queries, but this is acceptable for a template."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document,98,"Lines 50-150","Comprehensive test case document shows excellent structure with proper table formatting, consistent ID numbering (TC01-TC17), and more complete pytest implementation including fixtures, setup/teardown, and detailed assertions. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with valid test case structures and functional pytest code. Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document shows slightly better implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Case_Document,,"Expand test coverage to include performance testing, schema validation, and partitioning scenarios. Add actual SQL queries to pytest functions instead of placeholder comments. Consider adding setup/teardown fixtures for better test isolation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document,,"Improve table formatting consistency for better readability. Consider adding more specific assertions in pytest functions. The comprehensive approach is excellent - maintain this level of detail for future test case documents."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for BigQuery testing. Consider combining the focused approach of Test_Case_Document with the comprehensive coverage of Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document for optimal results. Implement actual SQL queries in pytest functions for complete test automation."
