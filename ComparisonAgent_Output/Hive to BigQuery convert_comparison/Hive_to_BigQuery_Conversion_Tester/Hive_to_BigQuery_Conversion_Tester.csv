Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both agents produced comprehensive test case documents for Hive to BigQuery conversion testing with accompanying Pytest scripts. Agent_1 focused on 10 specific test cases (TC001-TC010) targeting core functionality validation, while Agent_2 provided 17 test cases (TC01-TC17) with broader coverage including performance and manual intervention testing. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of BigQuery testing requirements with well-structured test documentation and automated testing frameworks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-150,"Both outputs address the same core goal of validating Hive to BigQuery conversion through comprehensive test cases. Agent_1 emphasizes specific business logic validation (customer analytics, RFM scoring, seasonal patterns) while Agent_2 takes a more technical approach covering schema validation, performance testing, and conversion-specific concerns. The semantic intent aligns well with minor differences in emphasis and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-150,"Agent_1 uses a numbered list format (1-10) with consistent structure per test case, while Agent_2 employs a tabular format with 17 test cases. Both include Pytest scripts but with different organizational approaches. Agent_1 has more detailed test case descriptions while Agent_2 uses a more concise tabular presentation. The overall flow and decomposition show good alignment despite format differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-75,"Agent_1 demonstrates excellent syntax and structure. Test cases are well-formed with proper ID numbering (TC001-TC010), clear descriptions, preconditions, test steps, and expected results. The Pytest script shows correct Python syntax with proper imports, function definitions, and assertion logic. Minor issue: some SQL query placeholders are incomplete (line 45-50 in Pytest section)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,76-150,"Agent_2 shows strong structural correctness with proper table formatting and consistent test case organization (TC01-TC17). The Pytest script demonstrates good Python practices with fixtures and comprehensive test structure. Minor issues include some placeholder comments that need completion (lines 95-100) and the test execution report template is incomplete (lines 140-145)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with well-formed test documentation and valid Python code structures. Minor placeholder completions needed in both outputs but overall quality is excellent."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,45-50,"Complete the SQL query placeholders in the Pytest script functions to enable full test execution. Consider adding performance and schema validation test cases to match the comprehensive coverage of Agent_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,95-100,"Fill in the placeholder comments in the Pytest script with actual implementation details. Complete the test execution report template with proper formatting and structure to match the quality of the test case documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Integration of Agent_1's detailed business logic focus with Agent_2's technical validation approach, 2) Standardization of test case numbering format, 3) Addition of data setup/teardown procedures, 4) Inclusion of negative test scenarios for edge cases."
