# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent Test_Case_Document provides 10 focused test cases (TC001-TC010) with clear structure and pytest implementation. Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document delivers 17 comprehensive test cases (TC01-TC17) with enhanced coverage including performance, partitioning, and error handling. Both outputs are well-structured test case documents for BigQuery validation with functional pytest scripts.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address Hive-to-BigQuery conversion testing with similar core objectives. Agent Test_Case_Document covers essential validation areas (calculations, exclusions, tiers, nulls, categories, patterns, RFM, limits) while Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document expands coverage to include schema validation, performance testing, partitioning recommendations, and error handling. The semantic intent is highly aligned but Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document provides broader scope.

**Line References**: Lines 1-50 vs 1-80

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with numbered test cases and pytest implementations. Agent Test_Case_Document uses a narrative format with clear sections (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result). Agent Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document uses a more structured table format with identical column headers. Both include pytest scripts with similar helper functions and test structure, though Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document includes additional fixtures and setup/teardown logic.

**Line References**: Lines 1-30 vs 1-40

### Correctness

**Test_Case_Document (Score: 95/100)**
Test case document is well-formed with consistent ID numbering (TC001-TC010), clear descriptions, and valid pytest syntax. Minor issue: some test functions have placeholder comments '-- Add the SQL query snippet' instead of actual queries, but this is acceptable for a template.
**Line References**: Lines 45-120

**Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document (Score: 98/100)**
Comprehensive test case document shows excellent structure with proper table formatting, consistent ID numbering (TC01-TC17), and more complete pytest implementation including fixtures, setup/teardown, and detailed assertions. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in table alignment.
**Line References**: Lines 50-150

**Overall Correctness**: 97/100

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Test_Case_Document | Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document | Overall |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **86** | **87** | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For Test_Case_Document:**
- Expand test coverage to include performance testing, schema validation, and partitioning scenarios
- Add actual SQL queries to pytest functions instead of placeholder comments
- Consider adding setup/teardown fixtures for better test isolation

**For Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document:**
- Improve table formatting consistency for better readability
- Consider adding more specific assertions in pytest functions
- The comprehensive approach is excellent - maintain this level of detail for future test case documents

**For Both:**
Both outputs provide solid foundations for BigQuery testing. Consider combining the focused approach of Test_Case_Document with the comprehensive coverage of Comprehensive_Test_Case_Document for optimal results. Implement actual SQL queries in pytest functions for complete test automation.
