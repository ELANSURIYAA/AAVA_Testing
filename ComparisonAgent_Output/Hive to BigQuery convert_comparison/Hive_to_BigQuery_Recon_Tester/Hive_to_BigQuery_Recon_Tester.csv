Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two Python scripts for Hive to BigQuery migration validation were compared. Agent 2 provides a significantly more comprehensive solution with 95% semantic alignment, 75% structural similarity, and higher correctness scores. Agent 1 offers a basic framework while Agent 2 delivers production-ready functionality with extensive error handling, logging, progress tracking, and robust comparison logic."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-400 (Agent 2)","Both scripts address Hive to BigQuery migration validation with data export, GCS upload, external table creation, and result comparison. Agent 2 provides significantly more comprehensive functionality including SQL parsing, CTE analysis, integrity checks, detailed comparison reports, and production-grade error handling. Minor semantic differences in approach to schema handling and comparison methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 20-45 (Agent 1), Lines 50-100 (Agent 2)","Both follow similar high-level flow: connect to Hive, execute queries, export to Parquet, upload to GCS, create BigQuery external tables, compare results. Agent 2 has more modular structure with additional utility functions, comprehensive logging setup, and detailed comparison logic. Agent 1 uses simpler linear approach while Agent 2 implements more sophisticated error handling and progress tracking."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,85,"Lines 15, 25, 35, 50, 75","Syntax is valid Python with proper imports and function definitions. Minor issues: missing error handling in several functions, basic comparison logic that may not handle edge cases, limited validation of data types and null values. Connection handling is adequate but lacks robust error recovery."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 20, 45, 80, 120, 200, 350","Excellent syntax with comprehensive imports, proper exception handling, and robust function definitions. Minor issues: some placeholder comments for SQL content, but overall structure is production-ready with extensive error handling, logging, and data validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both scripts are syntactically correct with Agent 2 demonstrating superior error handling and robustness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance error handling throughout the script, add comprehensive logging and progress tracking, implement more robust data comparison logic with detailed mismatch reporting, add SQL parsing capabilities for automatic table detection, include integrity checks for file transfers, and add configuration validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Replace placeholder SQL content with actual queries, add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios, consider adding parallel processing for large datasets, implement data sampling for very large tables, and add configuration file support for easier deployment across environments."
