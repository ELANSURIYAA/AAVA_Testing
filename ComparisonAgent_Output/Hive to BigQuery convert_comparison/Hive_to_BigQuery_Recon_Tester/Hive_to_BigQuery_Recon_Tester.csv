Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents deliver Python scripts for Hive to BigQuery migration validation with strong semantic alignment (92/100) and similar structural approaches (85/100). Agent 2 provides significantly more comprehensive implementation with better error handling, logging, and documentation. Both scripts are syntactically correct (100/100 each). Agent 2 is recommended for production use due to superior robustness and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both scripts address identical core objectives: connecting to Hive, executing queries, exporting data to Parquet, uploading to GCS, creating BigQuery external tables, and comparing results. Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality while Agent 2 adds comprehensive logging, error handling, progress tracking, and detailed comparison logic. Minor semantic differences in comparison methodology (Agent 1 uses simple DataFrame comparison, Agent 2 implements column-wise analysis with mismatch sampling)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both scripts follow similar high-level structure: imports, configuration, utility functions, Hive operations, GCS operations, BigQuery operations, comparison logic, and main execution flow. Agent 2 provides more granular function decomposition with dedicated sections for logging setup, progress tracking, and detailed reporting. Agent 1 uses more compact structure while Agent 2 emphasizes modularity and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic,100,N/A,"Script is syntactically correct with proper imports, function definitions, variable usage, and control flow. All referenced variables are defined, function calls are valid, and Python syntax is accurate throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive,100,N/A,"Script is syntactically correct with comprehensive imports, proper function definitions, consistent variable usage, and valid Python syntax. All dependencies are properly imported and used correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both scripts demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with no syntax errors, undefined variables, or structural issues detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Consider adding comprehensive logging and error handling mechanisms similar to Agent 2. Implement progress tracking for long-running operations. Add detailed comparison reporting with column-wise analysis and mismatch sampling. Include configuration validation and environment variable checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 1-300,"Excellent comprehensive implementation. Consider adding unit tests for individual functions. Add configuration file support for better deployment flexibility. Consider implementing parallel processing for large dataset handling. Add data quality checks and validation rules."
