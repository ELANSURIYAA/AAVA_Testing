Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two Python scripts for Hive to BigQuery migration validation with significant differences in implementation depth. Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic provides core functionality while Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive offers enterprise-grade features with enhanced error handling, logging, and robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both scripts address identical core objectives: connecting to Hive, executing queries, exporting data to Parquet, uploading to GCS, creating BigQuery external tables, and comparing results. The fundamental business logic and data flow are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in variable naming (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt vs table_ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrts) and function organization don't affect core meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,,"Both follow similar high-level workflow but differ significantly in structural organization. Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic uses a more linear main() function approach, while Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive employs modular design with dedicated utility functions, comprehensive logging setup, and better separation of concerns. Function decomposition and error handling patterns differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic,88,"Lines 1,8,45,78,92","Syntax is valid with proper imports and function definitions. Minor issues: missing error handling in main() function, potential undefined variable 'comparison_ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' usage in logging statement (line 92), and inconsistent variable naming with ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt suffix."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive,95,"Lines 45,67,89,156,234","Excellent syntax with comprehensive imports, proper exception handling, and consistent variable naming. Minor issues: potential import conflicts with 'from google.cloud import storage' and 'from google.cloud import bigquery' on separate lines (lines 15-16), and hardcoded placeholder string in bq_sql variable (line 234)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92. Both scripts are syntactically sound with Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive showing superior code quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Basic,,"Enhance error handling in main() function, add comprehensive logging, fix variable naming inconsistency with ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt suffix, and implement progress tracking for better production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Comprehensive,,"Replace hardcoded placeholder SQL string with actual implementation, consolidate Google Cloud imports for cleaner code organization, and consider adding configuration validation for environment variables."
