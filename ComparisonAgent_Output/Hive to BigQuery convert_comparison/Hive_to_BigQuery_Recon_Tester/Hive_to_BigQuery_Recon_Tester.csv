Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide Python scripts for Hive to BigQuery migration validation with similar core functionality. Agent_2 demonstrates significantly superior implementation with comprehensive logging, error handling, progress reporting, and robust comparison logic. Agent_1 provides basic functionality but lacks enterprise-grade features and has some structural issues."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both scripts address the same core objective of Hive to BigQuery migration validation. They follow similar workflows: connect to Hive, execute queries, export to Parquet, upload to GCS, create BigQuery external tables, and compare results. Agent_2 provides more comprehensive semantic coverage with additional features like progress reporting, detailed logging, and robust error handling that align with enterprise migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both scripts follow similar high-level structure with main() function and supporting utilities. However, Agent_2 demonstrates superior organization with clear configuration sections, comprehensive logging setup, utility functions, and modular design. Agent_1 has a more basic structure with functions defined in sequence. Agent_2 includes additional structural elements like progress reporting, detailed comparison logic, and comprehensive error handling that Agent_1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,82,"Lines 8, 45, 78, 104","Agent_1 has several syntax and structural issues: Line 8 uses non-standard import format, Line 45 has undefined variable reference in compare_dataframes function, Line 78 contains placeholder SQL comments instead of actual queries, Line 104 has inconsistent variable naming with 'comparison_ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' containing special characters that may cause issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,94,"Lines 156, 203","Agent_2 demonstrates high correctness with proper imports, consistent variable naming, and robust error handling. Minor issues include: Line 156 uses deprecated hive.Connection constructor parameter 'auth="CUSTOM"' which may not be supported in all versions, Line 203 has placeholder SQL comment that needs replacement with actual BigQuery SQL."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Agent_2 significantly outperforms Agent_1 in syntax correctness and code quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Agent_1 requires significant improvements: Fix import statements and variable naming conventions, Replace placeholder SQL with actual queries, Implement proper error handling and logging, Add progress reporting for long-running operations, Improve comparison logic to handle data type mismatches and provide detailed mismatch analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Agent_2 is production-ready with minor improvements needed: Replace placeholder BigQuery SQL with actual converted queries, Verify hive.Connection parameters for compatibility with target Hive version, Consider adding configuration validation at startup, Add unit tests for comparison logic functions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents would benefit from: Adding comprehensive unit tests, Implementing configuration validation, Adding support for incremental data validation, Including performance metrics and timing information, Adding support for different file formats beyond Parquet."
