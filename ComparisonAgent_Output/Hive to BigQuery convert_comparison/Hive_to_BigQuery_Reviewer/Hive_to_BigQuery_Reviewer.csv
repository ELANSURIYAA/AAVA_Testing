Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive evaluations of Hive to BigQuery SQL conversion accuracy. Agent 2 delivers significantly more detailed analysis with actual code examples, comprehensive test cases, and automation scripts, while Agent 1 provides a more concise but complete assessment. Both reach similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-7 (both agents)","Both outputs address the same core objective of evaluating Hive to BigQuery conversion accuracy. They follow identical structural organization with 7 main sections and reach consistent conclusions about conversion quality. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more implementation detail and practical examples, while Agent 1 focuses on high-level assessment. The semantic intent and business conclusions are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-7 (both agents)","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost. The logical flow and section decomposition are virtually identical, with Agent 2 expanding each section with more detailed content while maintaining the same organizational framework."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 1-7","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor deduction for less comprehensive coverage compared to expected depth for this type of analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-200+","Agent 2 output is syntactically perfect with proper SQL formatting, valid code examples, comprehensive test case structure, and accurate technical documentation. All references and examples are internally consistent and technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99"
