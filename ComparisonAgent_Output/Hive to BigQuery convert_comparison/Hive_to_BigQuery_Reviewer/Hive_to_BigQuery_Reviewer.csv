Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of Hive to BigQuery SQL conversion with similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and completeness. Agent 1 focuses on high-level assessment while Agent 2 provides more detailed technical analysis with actual code examples."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 15-25","Both outputs address the same core goal of analyzing Hive to BigQuery conversion accuracy. They share similar intent in evaluating conversion correctness, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more technical depth with actual SQL code examples while Agent 1 remains at a higher conceptual level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs follow similar logical structure with Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. However, Agent 2 includes additional sections like full SQL code examples and detailed test cases that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 1-25","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with well-structured sections, consistent terminology, and proper formatting. Minor issue with API cost formatting consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 1-200","Agent 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive structure, valid SQL syntax in code examples, proper markdown formatting, and consistent section organization. Very minor formatting variations in some sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
