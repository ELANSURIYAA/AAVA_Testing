Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-7 (Agent 1), Lines 1-7 (Agent 2)","Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of Hive to BigQuery SQL conversion accuracy. Agent 1 delivers a structured 7-section analysis focusing on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization recommendations with API cost of $0.015. Agent 2 provides the same analytical framework but includes extensive additional content: full original and converted SQL code examples, comprehensive test case suite (TC01-TC17), and automated validation Python script, with lower API cost of $0.005. Both maintain identical semantic intent and structural organization while Agent 2 offers significantly more implementation detail and validation resources."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-7 (Agent 1), Lines 1-7 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing Hive to BigQuery conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. The semantic intent, business logic coverage, and analytical conclusions are highly aligned. Both cover conversion accuracy, data type handling, control flow logic, SQL operations, partitioning considerations, NULL handling, date functions, window functions, edge cases, and optimization strategies. Minor semantic differences exist in depth of technical detail and implementation examples, but the fundamental understanding and approach are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-7 (Agent 1), Lines 1-7 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow identical 7-section structural organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost. The logical flow, section decomposition, and hierarchical organization are nearly identical. Agent 2 extends the structure with additional implementation artifacts (SQL code, test cases, Python script) but maintains the same core analytical framework. The structural similarity is exceptional with only minor differences in content depth within each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,"Lines 1-7","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, no broken links, and well-formed section structure. All technical terminology is used correctly, numerical values are properly formatted, and the API cost reference is valid. No syntax errors, undefined references, or structural inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,"Lines 1-7, SQL code blocks, Python script","Agent 2 output is syntactically correct across all components: main analysis text, SQL code blocks, test case specifications, and Python validation script. All SQL syntax is valid for both Hive and BigQuery dialects, Python code follows proper syntax conventions, and all internal references are consistent. No syntax errors, broken code examples, or structural inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both agents produce syntactically correct, well-formed outputs with no structural or formatting errors. All technical content is properly formatted and internally consistent."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 4-6","Agent 1 provides solid foundational analysis and recommendations. To enhance value: (1) Include concrete implementation examples like SQL code snippets, (2) Provide validation methodologies and test cases, (3) Add automation scripts for regression testing, (4) Consider cost-benefit analysis of optimization suggestions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 1-7, additional content sections","Agent 2 delivers exceptional comprehensive analysis with implementation-ready artifacts. Strengths include full SQL examples, extensive test suite, and automation scripts. Minor enhancement opportunities: (1) Add performance benchmarking results, (2) Include migration timeline estimates, (3) Provide cost comparison analysis between optimization approaches, (4) Add troubleshooting guide for common conversion issues."
