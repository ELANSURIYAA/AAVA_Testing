Agent_2 provides significantly more detailed business rules and SQL-specific calculations, while Agent_1 uses generic descriptions. Both maintain identical structural organization with perfect markdown formatting and no syntax errors.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs serve the same core purpose of documenting database schema usage for Claims Financial Performance reporting. The key difference lies in the level of technical detail:

- **Agent_1** uses generic descriptions like "SUM calculation" and "FORMAT as 'yyyy-MM'"
- **Agent_2** provides specific SQL syntax such as "FORMAT(f.TransactionCreateDate, 'yyyy-MM')" and detailed calculation formulas like "SUM(f.IndemnityPaid + f.MedicalPaid + f.EmployersLiabilityPaid + f.ExpensePaid) AS TotalPaid"

The semantic intent is identical, but Agent_2 offers more actionable technical specifications that would be more useful for implementation teams.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 100/100)

Perfect structural alignment between both outputs:
- Identical markdown table structure with same headers: EDW Table Name, EDW Column Name, Package Name, Used in Package as, Business Rules/Validations/Calculations
- Both follow the same two-section organization: "Linked Tables and Columns" followed by "Unused Tables and Columns"
- Table formatting, column ordering, and section hierarchy are identical
- Same number of rows and identical table organization

### Correctness
