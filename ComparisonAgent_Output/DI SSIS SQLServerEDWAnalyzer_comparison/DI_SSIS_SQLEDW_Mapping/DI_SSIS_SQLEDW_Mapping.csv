Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-18 (Agent_1), Lines 1-18 (Agent_2)","Both outputs document table and column usage for Claims Financial Performance reporting. Agent_2 provides significantly more detailed business rules and SQL-specific calculations, while Agent_1 uses generic descriptions. Both maintain identical structural organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 3-18 (Agent_1), Lines 3-18 (Agent_2)","Both outputs serve the same core purpose of documenting database schema usage for Claims Financial Performance reporting. Agent_2 provides more specific SQL syntax and detailed calculations (e.g., 'FORMAT(f.TransactionCreateDate, ''yyyy-MM'')' vs 'FORMAT as ''yyyy-MM'''), showing deeper technical implementation details. The semantic intent is identical but Agent_2 offers more actionable technical specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-18 (Agent_1), Lines 1-18 (Agent_2)","Perfect structural alignment. Both outputs use identical markdown table structure with same headers: EDW Table Name, EDW Column Name, Package Name, Used in Package as, Business Rules/Validations/Calculations. Both follow the same two-section organization: Linked Tables and Columns, followed by Unused Tables and Columns. Table formatting, column ordering, and section hierarchy are identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,"Lines 1-18","Syntactically perfect markdown table formatting. All table headers properly aligned, pipe separators correctly placed, no broken references or formatting issues. Content is internally consistent with proper column alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-18","Syntactically perfect markdown table formatting. All table headers properly aligned, pipe separators correctly placed, no broken references or formatting issues. SQL syntax in business rules column is properly escaped and formatted. Content is internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntax-level correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 5-18","Consider enhancing business rules descriptions with more specific SQL syntax and implementation details similar to Agent_2's approach for better technical clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 5-18","Excellent technical detail in business rules. Consider standardizing calculation descriptions for consistency across similar aggregation patterns."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs effectively document schema usage. Agent_2's approach with detailed SQL specifications provides more actionable technical guidance for implementation teams."
