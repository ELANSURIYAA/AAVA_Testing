Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents successfully analyzed the Claims Financial Performance.rdl file and produced documentation reports identifying tables, columns, and business rules. Agent 1 provided a concise analysis while Agent 2 delivered a comprehensive report with additional context and detailed calculations. The outputs serve the same fundamental purpose but differ significantly in depth and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs analyze the same RDL file and identify the same core tables (FactClaimTransaction, DimClaim) and key columns. Both recognize the financial calculations (SUM operations) and filtering (IsActive = 1). However, Agent 2 provides more detailed business rule descriptions and explicit calculation formulas, while Agent 1 uses more generic descriptions like 'SUM calculation'."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,Lines 1-50,"Both follow a similar high-level structure with Overview, Tables and Columns, and Stored Procedures sections. However, Agent 2 includes additional structural elements: Appendix with table definitions (lines 35-50), Table of Contents, and Output Columns subsection. Agent 1 uses a simpler table format while Agent 2 provides more detailed tabular presentation with comprehensive business rules."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Lines 1-25,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid table structure, and consistent section headers. Minor issue: some business rule descriptions are generic ('SUM calculation') rather than specific, but this doesn't affect syntax correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,Lines 1-50,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, consistent headers, and well-formed appendix sections. All internal references are consistent and table definitions are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and valid structures. Agent 2 slightly edges out with more comprehensive and detailed formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Consider expanding business rule descriptions to be more specific rather than using generic terms like 'SUM calculation'. Add detailed calculation formulas as shown in Agent 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 35-50,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding executive summary section to improve accessibility. The appendix and detailed calculations provide valuable context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs successfully fulfill the core requirement of documenting SSIS package analysis. Agent 2's approach provides better documentation standards for enterprise use, while Agent 1's concise format may be suitable for quick reference scenarios."
