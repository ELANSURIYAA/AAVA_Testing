Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two JSON outputs containing SSIS design pattern classifications for 10 ETL packages. Agent 1 provides comprehensive but potentially over-inclusive pattern assignments with generic explanations. Agent 2 offers more precise pattern classifications with specific, contextual explanations that better distinguish between different package types (orchestrators vs. standard ETL vs. DDL)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All lines,"Both outputs address the same core task of classifying SSIS design patterns for identical file sets. However, they differ significantly in classification granularity and reasoning depth. Agent 1 applies broad pattern coverage (10-13 patterns per file) with generic explanations, while Agent 2 uses targeted pattern selection (4-9 patterns) with specific contextual reasoning. The semantic intent aligns but the interpretation of pattern applicability diverges substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs maintain identical JSON structure with consistent key-value pairs (design_pattern arrays and oo_reason strings). File ordering, naming conventions, and overall schema are perfectly aligned. The only structural difference is in array lengths within design_pattern fields, but the fundamental organization remains consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,90,Lines 2-4,"Valid JSON syntax throughout. All design_pattern arrays contain valid pattern codes. Minor issue: some oo_reason explanations are generic and could be more specific (e.g., lines 2-4 use similar 'custom transformations' phrasing across different package types)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,Lines 15-17,"Valid JSON syntax with no structural issues. Design_pattern arrays contain valid codes and oo_reason explanations are contextually appropriate and specific to each package type. Minor formatting inconsistency in spacing around brackets in lines 15-17."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic validity with minor presentation issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,Lines 2-50,"Improve specificity in oo_reason explanations. Avoid generic phrases like 'custom transformations' and provide more contextual detail about why specific patterns apply to each package type."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,Lines 15-17,"Address minor formatting inconsistencies in JSON structure. Consider providing slightly more detail in explanations while maintaining the current level of precision."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Establish clear criteria for pattern inclusion to ensure consistency. Agent 2's approach of distinguishing between orchestrator, standard ETL, and DDL patterns provides better classification accuracy and should be considered the preferred methodology."
