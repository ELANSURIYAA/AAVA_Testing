Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs address ECL to Java Springboot migration cost estimation for a Constants.ecl module. JSON_Output provides structured data with specific numeric values and categories, while Markdown_Output offers detailed explanations with cost justifications. Both conclude zero runtime costs due to constants-only nature of the module."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs correctly identify that the Constants.ecl module contains only static constants requiring no runtime processing. Both conclude zero runtime costs and minimal manual effort. JSON_Output quantifies effort at 1-2 hours total, while Markdown_Output estimates 0.75-1.25 hours. Both recognize no data processing requirements and similar cost justifications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"JSON_Output uses structured hierarchical format with nested categories (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing sections, API Cost). Markdown_Output follows sequential narrative structure with numbered sections. Both cover same core areas but organize information differently - JSON emphasizes data structure while Markdown emphasizes readability and explanation flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,JSON_Output,95,"Lines 8-9, 23-24","Well-formed JSON structure with consistent data types. Minor issues: Lines 8-9 show '0 GB' for memory allocation which should be 'N/A' for constants-only module. Lines 23-24 effort estimation could be more precise in decimal format rather than integers."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Markdown_Output,98,"Line 15","Excellent markdown formatting with proper headers, bullet points, and structure. Minor issue at Line 15: cost estimate shows '$0.00' but could specify 'negligible baseline service cost' for more precision."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper formatting and internal consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,JSON_Output,,"Lines 8-9, 23-24","Consider using 'N/A' instead of '0 GB' for memory fields when no processing occurs. Use decimal precision for effort estimates to improve accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Markdown_Output,,"Line 15","Consider adding brief mention of baseline service costs even when negligible to provide complete cost picture."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs could benefit from explicit version control considerations and deployment cost factors. Consider standardizing effort estimation methodology between structured and narrative formats."
