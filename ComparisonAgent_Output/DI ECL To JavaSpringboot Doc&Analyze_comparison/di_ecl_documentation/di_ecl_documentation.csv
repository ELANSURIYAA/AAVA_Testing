Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of the same ECL Constants module. JSON_Analysis delivers structured data in JSON format with quantitative metrics, while Markdown_Documentation provides formatted documentation with business context. Both correctly identify the module's purpose as defining reusable constants (NotFoundStatus and MaxJoinLimit) for ECL scripts. The outputs complement each other - JSON_Analysis focuses on technical structure while Markdown_Documentation emphasizes business value and integration context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All lines,"Both outputs analyze the same ECL Constants module with high semantic alignment. Both correctly identify: 1) Module exports NotFoundStatus='Not found' and MaxJoinLimit=2000, 2) Purpose as centralized configuration management, 3) No data processing or external dependencies. JSON_Analysis provides quantitative complexity metrics (5 lines, 0 datasets, complexity score 5), while Markdown_Documentation offers business context and integration guidance (complexity score 2/100). Minor divergence in complexity scoring methodology but same core understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,All sections,"Significant structural differences despite similar logical flow. JSON_Analysis uses numbered sections (1-8) with nested objects for data flow and complexity analysis. Markdown_Documentation uses hierarchical headers with tables for data mapping. Both follow similar sequence: Overview → Structure → Data Flow → Mapping → Complexity → Outputs. JSON_Analysis more granular with separate business purpose section, while Markdown_Documentation integrates business context throughout. Different organizational philosophies but comparable information architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,JSON_Analysis,95,Lines 1-50,"Valid JSON structure with proper nesting and syntax. All required fields present and correctly formatted. Minor issue: complexity analysis shows 'Number of Lines: 5' but actual ECL script likely has different line count. All other technical details syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Markdown_Documentation,98,Lines 1-80,"Excellent markdown formatting with proper headers, tables, and code blocks. All internal references consistent. Table formatting correct with proper alignment. Only minor issue: complexity score shows '2/100' which may be inconsistent with stated '5 lines' metric."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness. JSON_Analysis has valid JSON structure, Markdown_Documentation has proper markdown formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor inconsistencies in complexity metrics but otherwise excellent technical quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,JSON_Analysis,,Lines 20-30,"Standardize complexity scoring methodology to ensure consistency with actual code metrics. Consider adding business context sections to complement technical analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Markdown_Documentation,,Lines 40-50,"Align quantitative complexity metrics with technical specifications. Consider adding structured data elements for better machine readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs provide valuable but complementary perspectives. Consider hybrid approach combining JSON_Analysis structured data with Markdown_Documentation business context for optimal documentation coverage."
