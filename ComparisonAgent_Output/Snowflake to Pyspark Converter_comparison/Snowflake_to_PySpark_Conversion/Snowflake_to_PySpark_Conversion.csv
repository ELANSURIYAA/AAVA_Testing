Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents successfully convert Snowflake stored procedure logic to PySpark, processing orders from the past 30 days and calculating customer summaries. Agent_2 demonstrates superior PySpark practices with DataFrame aggregation, while Agent_1 uses less efficient iterative processing. Key differences include data filtering approaches, aggregation methods, and code efficiency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective: processing recent orders and generating customer summaries. Agent_1 uses datetime.now() for filtering (line 9), while Agent_2 uses expr('date_sub(current_timestamp(), 30)') (line 15-17). Both calculate TotalAmount and OrderCount, and both print customer summaries in identical format (lines 21-22 vs line 31-33). The semantic intent is highly aligned despite implementation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,All,"Both scripts follow similar initialization patterns with SparkSession creation (lines 1-6). Major structural difference: Agent_1 uses iterative processing with distinct().collect() and loops (lines 11-22), while Agent_2 uses DataFrame groupBy aggregation (lines 19-25). Agent_1 has explicit spark.stop() (line 25), Agent_2 comments it out (line 37). Both maintain logical flow: initialize -> filter -> process -> output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,75,"9,21","Syntax issues: Line 9 mixes datetime.now() with DataFrame operations incorrectly - should use PySpark date functions. Line 21 uses collect()[0] which is inefficient and risky for large datasets. The approach works but violates PySpark best practices by bringing data to driver unnecessarily."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,15-17,"Syntactically sound with proper PySpark functions. Uses expr('date_sub(current_timestamp(), 30)') for date filtering (lines 15-17) which is correct. Proper use of DataFrame operations throughout. Only minor issue: assumes 'orders_df' exists without explicit loading (line 11 comment)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,All,"Average correctness score. Agent_2 demonstrates significantly better PySpark practices with proper DataFrame operations and built-in functions. Agent_1 has functional but suboptimal code with datetime mixing and inefficient collect() usage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"9,11-22","Replace datetime.now() with PySpark date functions like current_timestamp() and date_sub(). Eliminate collect() loops by using DataFrame groupBy aggregation. This will improve performance and follow PySpark best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,11,"Add explicit DataFrame loading code or clear documentation about data source assumptions. Consider adding error handling for missing data sources."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both implementations would benefit from: 1) Explicit schema definition for better performance, 2) Error handling for missing files/data, 3) Configurable date ranges instead of hardcoded 30 days, 4) Logging instead of print statements for production use."
