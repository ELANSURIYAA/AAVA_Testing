Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform complete comparison due to missing or improperly formatted agent outputs. The input variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} appear to be placeholders that were not properly substituted with actual agent outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Both input variables appear to be empty or contain placeholder text."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. No code or documentation structure available for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness - no output available from Snowflake agent"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness - no output available from PySpark agent"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to missing agent outputs"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent outputs are properly provided as input variables. 2. Verify that the input substitution mechanism is working correctly. 3. Re-run the comparison once valid agent outputs are available. 4. Consider providing sample outputs for testing the comparison framework."
