Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"N/A","Unable to perform detailed comparison due to missing or improperly formatted agent outputs. Template structure provided for Snowflake to PySpark conversion comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,"N/A","Cannot assess semantic similarity without readable agent outputs. Would typically evaluate SQL to PySpark transformation logic, data type mappings, and functional equivalence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,"N/A","Cannot assess structural similarity without readable agent outputs. Would typically compare code organization, function decomposition, and transformation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Agent_1,0,"N/A","Cannot validate syntax without readable output. Would check PySpark syntax, DataFrame operations, and SQL translation accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Agent_2,0,"N/A","Cannot validate syntax without readable output. Would check PySpark syntax, DataFrame operations, and SQL translation accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,"N/A","Average correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent scores."
