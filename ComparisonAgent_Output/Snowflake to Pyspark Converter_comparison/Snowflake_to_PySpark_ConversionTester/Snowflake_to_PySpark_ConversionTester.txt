# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as the required agent outputs were not provided. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` but no actual content to analyze.

## Detailed Analysis

### Error Analysis
The comparison cannot be completed due to missing required inputs:
- Agent 1 output: Not provided (placeholder variable found)
- Agent 2 output: Not provided (placeholder variable found)

### Missing Components
- Semantic Similarity Analysis: Cannot be performed without agent outputs
- Structural Similarity Analysis: Cannot be performed without agent outputs  
- Correctness Evaluation: Cannot be performed without agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Score | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | Missing inputs |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | Missing inputs |
| Correctness | N/A | Missing inputs |
| Overall | N/A | Missing inputs |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace placeholder variables with actual agent outputs to enable comparison
2. **Verify Input Format**: Ensure agent outputs are properly formatted and complete
3. **Re-run Analysis**: Once inputs are provided, re-execute the comparison process
