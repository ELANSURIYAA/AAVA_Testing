# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent outputs show fundamental divergence: **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser** reports file access failure while **Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester** delivers comprehensive test suite. No semantic alignment exists between error reporting and test case implementation.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 5/100)

The outputs address completely different aspects of the task. **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser** focuses on a file access error (line 1), reporting that a specific file cannot be located in the directory. In contrast, **Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester** provides comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementation (lines 1-200), including 8 detailed test cases covering happy path, edge cases, and error handling scenarios. There is no shared intent or purpose alignment between these outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 10/100)

The structural approaches are fundamentally different. **Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser** uses a single-line error message format, while **Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester** employs a structured approach with:
- Test case documentation using ID/description/outcome format
- Multi-function pytest implementation with fixtures
- Comprehensive code organization with imports, helper functions, and test methods

### Correctness

**Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser (Score: 100/100)**
The error message is syntactically correct and properly formatted as a status report (line 1).

**Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester (Score: 95/100)**
The Python code is well-formed with proper imports, function definitions, and pytest structure. Minor issue identified: missing import for `count` function (around lines 85-90) - should import `count` from `pyspark.sql.functions` alongside the existing `_count` import.

**Overall Correctness: 98/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser | Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester | Overall |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 5 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 10 |
| Correctness | 100 | 95 | 98 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **38** |

## Recommendations

**For Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser:**
- Implement file existence validation and provide alternative file suggestions or directory listing to help users locate correct files
- Consider adding more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

**For Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester:**
- Add missing `count` import from `pyspark.sql.functions` to ensure all dependencies are properly declared
- Consider adding more edge cases for schema validation and performance testing scenarios
- Expand test coverage to include more complex data transformation scenarios
