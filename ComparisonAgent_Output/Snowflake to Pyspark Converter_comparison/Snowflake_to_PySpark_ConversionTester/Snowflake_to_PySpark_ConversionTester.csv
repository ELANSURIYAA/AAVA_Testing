Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent comparison reveals a critical disparity: Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser output is missing/unavailable (file not found error), while PySpark_Test_Cases provides a comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases covering happy path, edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions. The comparison is fundamentally asymmetric due to the missing first agent output."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,N/A,"Semantic alignment is severely compromised. Agent Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser provides only an error message indicating file unavailability, while PySpark_Test_Cases delivers comprehensive test coverage for order analysis functionality. The intended semantic purpose (order details analysis) can be inferred from naming, but actual implementation comparison is impossible due to missing content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,N/A,"Structural comparison is not feasible. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser lacks any structural content (error state), while PySpark_Test_Cases demonstrates well-organized structure with 8 distinct test cases, pytest fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive edge case coverage. No structural alignment can be assessed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,0,Line 1,"Complete failure - file not found error prevents any syntax or correctness evaluation. The output contains only an error message about missing file location."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Test_Cases,95,Lines 45-47,"High syntactic correctness with minor issues. The pytest script demonstrates proper Python syntax, correct PySpark DataFrame operations, appropriate use of fixtures and assertions. Minor concern: missing explicit import for 'count' function (line 45-47 uses _count but imports count as _count, potential naming conflict)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,47.5,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (0 + 95) / 2 = 47.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,N/A,N/A,"Critical: Locate and provide the missing Snowflake stored procedure file. Verify file path and naming conventions. Ensure proper file accessibility and content availability before comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Test_Cases,N/A,Lines 4-6,"Excellent test coverage and structure. Minor improvement: Add explicit schema validation tests and consider adding performance benchmarking test cases. Review import statement for count function to avoid potential conflicts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Re-run comparison once Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser content is available. Current comparison is incomplete and not representative of actual agent capabilities due to missing input."
