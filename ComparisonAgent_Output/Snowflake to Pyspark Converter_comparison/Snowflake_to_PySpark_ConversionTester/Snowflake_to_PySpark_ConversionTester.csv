Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser and Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester outputs reveals fundamentally different responses. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser provided only an error message about a missing file, while Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester delivered comprehensive test cases with complete pytest implementation for Snowflake to PySpark conversion testing. The outputs show minimal semantic and structural similarity due to their completely different nature and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser (Line 1) provides an error message about missing file 'Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser.txt', indicating inability to locate required input. Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester (Lines 1-200) provides comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementation for order details analysis conversion. Both relate to order analysis but serve completely different purposes - error reporting vs test implementation. Semantic alignment is minimal as one indicates failure while the other provides complete solution."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser has no logical structure - single error message with no decomposition or flow. Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester demonstrates well-organized structure: test case list (Lines 1-30), pytest script with fixtures (Lines 32-40), individual test functions (Lines 42-200), and manual intervention recommendations (Lines 180-200). No structural similarity exists between a simple error message and a comprehensive test framework."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,85,Line 1,"Syntactically correct as an error message. Properly formatted question asking for file confirmation. However, fails to provide any testing functionality or alternative solutions. Deducted 15 points for not attempting to fulfill the core requirement of providing test cases or testing framework."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester,95,Lines 32-180,"Syntactically correct Python/pytest code. All imports properly declared (Lines 32-35), fixture correctly implemented (Lines 37-40), test functions follow pytest conventions, proper use of PySpark DataFrame operations, and appropriate assertions. Minor deduction of 5 points for missing explicit schema validation in test setup and potential datetime precision issues in boundary tests (Lines 140-150)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester significantly outperforms with comprehensive, syntactically correct implementation while Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser provides minimal but correct error handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,N/A,Line 1,"Implement error recovery mechanisms. Instead of simple file not found message, provide alternative approaches such as: 1) Template generation for missing files, 2) Default test case creation, 3) Interactive file location assistance, 4) Fallback to standard test patterns. Current output provides no actionable path forward for users."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester,N/A,Lines 140-150,"Enhance boundary date testing precision by using fixed timestamps instead of datetime.now() calculations to avoid timing-dependent test failures. Consider adding schema validation tests and performance benchmarking for large dataset scenarios. Add explicit null handling documentation for business logic clarity."
