Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"This comparison evaluates outputs from a Snowflake to PySpark conversion system. FileLocator produced an error message indicating inability to locate the required input file, while TestCaseGenerator successfully created comprehensive test cases for order details analysis. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to handling the conversion task - one failed at the input stage while the other proceeded with test case generation despite missing source material."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"FileLocator output (line 1) focuses on file location error, while TestCaseGenerator output (lines 1-200) addresses comprehensive testing strategy for order aggregation logic. Both relate to the same underlying task domain (Snowflake to PySpark conversion) but approach it from completely different angles - error handling vs. proactive test development. The semantic overlap is minimal as one represents failure state while the other represents successful test planning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"FileLocator uses simple error message structure (single sentence), while TestCaseGenerator employs complex hierarchical structure with test case descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest implementation. No structural similarity exists between a plain text error message and a structured test suite with multiple sections, code blocks, and systematic organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileLocator,95,Line 1,"Error message is syntactically correct and properly formatted. Clear communication of the specific issue (missing file). Minor deduction for not providing alternative solutions or next steps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,TestCaseGenerator,98,Lines 1-200,"Pytest script is syntactically valid Python with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. All test cases follow consistent naming conventions and include appropriate assertions. Minor deduction for missing explicit schema validation in TC06 test case (line 150) - the exception handling could be more specific about which columns are missing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileLocator,N/A,Line 1,"Implement robust file discovery mechanisms with fallback options. Provide suggested file paths or directory listings when target files are not found. Add logging for debugging file location issues."
Recommendations,Recommendation,TestCaseGenerator,N/A,Lines 1-200,"Enhance error handling in TC06 to specify exact missing columns. Consider adding integration tests that validate end-to-end conversion from Snowflake SQL to PySpark. Add performance benchmarking test cases for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Establish better coordination between file location and test generation components. FileLocator should provide structured output that TestCaseGenerator can consume. Consider implementing a unified error handling strategy across both agents."
