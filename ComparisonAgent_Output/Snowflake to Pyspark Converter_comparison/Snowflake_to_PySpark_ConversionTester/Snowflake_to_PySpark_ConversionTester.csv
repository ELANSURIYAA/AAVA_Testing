Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent outputs represent fundamentally different responses to what appears to be a Snowflake to PySpark conversion task. First agent reports file not found error while second agent provides comprehensive test suite and conversion analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Outputs address completely different aspects of the task. First output is an error message about missing file, second output assumes successful file access and provides comprehensive testing framework. No semantic alignment in purpose or intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Completely different structural approaches. First output uses simple error message format, second output uses complex multi-section structure with test cases, code blocks, and detailed analysis sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,95,Line 1,"Syntactically correct error message format with proper grammar and clear communication of the issue."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Case_Generator,90,"Lines 15-200","Well-formed pytest code with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor deduction for potential issues with datetime handling and missing explicit schema validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5, rounded to 93."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,,Line 1,"Should provide alternative file locations or suggest directory listing to help locate the missing file."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Case_Generator,,"Lines 50-60","Consider adding explicit schema validation and more robust datetime handling for boundary conditions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Outputs suggest different agents may have received different inputs or contexts. Recommend verifying task specification and input consistency."
