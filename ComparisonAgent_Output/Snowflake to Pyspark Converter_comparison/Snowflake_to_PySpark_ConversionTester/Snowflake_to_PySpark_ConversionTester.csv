Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform complete comparison due to missing agent output content. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual agent outputs. This analysis framework is provided as a template for when actual content is available."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Both agents appear to be focused on Snowflake to PySpark conversion based on context, but specific implementation details are unavailable for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze code structure, function organization, and logical flow patterns in conversion implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content. Would typically check for valid PySpark syntax, proper DataFrame operations, and correct SQL-to-PySpark translations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content. Would typically check for valid PySpark syntax, proper DataFrame operations, and correct SQL-to-PySpark translations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent evaluations. Average of both agent scores would be computed here."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent output content is properly provided for meaningful comparison. 2. Verify placeholder variable substitution in the input processing pipeline. 3. When actual outputs are available, focus comparison on: SQL syntax translation accuracy, PySpark DataFrame API usage, performance optimization patterns, error handling approaches, and code maintainability. 4. Implement proper input validation to prevent empty comparisons."
