Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Agent outputs show fundamental divergence: Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser reports file access failure while Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester delivers comprehensive test suite. No semantic alignment exists between error reporting and test case implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,1-1 vs 1-200,"Outputs address completely different aspects: Agent 1 focuses on file access error (line 1) while Agent 2 provides comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementation (lines 1-200). No shared intent or purpose alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,1 vs 1-200,"Agent 1 uses single-line error message format while Agent 2 employs structured test case documentation with ID/description/outcome format plus multi-function pytest implementation. Fundamentally different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,100,1,"Error message is syntactically correct and properly formatted as a status report."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester,95,85-90,"Python code is well-formed with proper imports, function definitions, and pytest structure. Minor issue: missing import for count function (line 85-90 area) - should import count from pyspark.sql.functions."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,,,"Implement file existence validation and provide alternative file suggestions or directory listing to help users locate correct files."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_to_PySpark_ConversionTester,,,"Add missing count import from pyspark.sql.functions. Consider adding more edge cases for schema validation and performance testing scenarios."
