Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"This comparison evaluates two fundamentally different outputs from a Snowflake to PySpark conversion task. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser reports a file location error, while PySpark_TestCases provides comprehensive test cases and implementation. The outputs represent completely different stages of the conversion process - error handling versus functional testing - resulting in minimal semantic and structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Agent outputs address entirely different aspects of the conversion task. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser (Line 1) reports a missing file error, while PySpark_TestCases (Lines 1-200) provides complete test case specifications and pytest implementation for order detail analysis. Both relate to the same domain (order processing) but serve completely different purposes in the conversion workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser uses simple error message format, while PySpark_TestCases employs structured test case documentation followed by comprehensive pytest implementation with fixtures, test functions, and assertions. No common structural elements exist between the outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,95,Line 1,"Error message is syntactically correct and appropriately formatted. Clear communication of file location issue with professional tone and actionable request for clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_TestCases,98,Lines 1-200,"Python code is syntactically valid with proper pytest structure. Minor deduction for missing import statement 'count' function (Line 85 uses _count but import shows count as _count). All test cases are well-formed with appropriate fixtures and assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,,"Verify file path and naming conventions. Ensure proper directory structure and file accessibility before proceeding with conversion tasks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_TestCases,,"Excellent test coverage and implementation. Consider adding integration tests and performance benchmarks for large datasets. Verify import statements for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"These outputs represent different stages of the conversion process. Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser should resolve file access issues before PySpark_TestCases implementation can be validated against actual conversion results."
