Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser and PySpark_ConversionTester reveals a fundamental mismatch. Agent 1 reports a missing file error while Agent 2 provides comprehensive test cases for Snowflake to PySpark conversion. This represents a complete divergence in output type and functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser reports file not found error (line 1) while PySpark_ConversionTester provides comprehensive test suite (lines 1-200). Both relate to Snowflake/PySpark context but serve completely different purposes - error reporting vs test implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,Line 1 vs Lines 1-200,"Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser has single-line error message structure while PySpark_ConversionTester has multi-section structure with test cases, pytest scripts, and documentation. No structural overlap exists."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,100,Line 1,"Error message is syntactically correct and properly formatted. Clear indication of missing file with appropriate question for confirmation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_ConversionTester,95,Lines 45-47,"Pytest scripts are syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions. Minor issue: missing import for 'count' function (line 45-47) which should be 'from pyspark.sql.functions import count'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser,N/A,Line 1,"Verify file location and provide correct path for Snowflake_SP_OrderDetails_Analyser.txt to enable proper comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_ConversionTester,N/A,Lines 45-47,"Add missing import statement: 'from pyspark.sql.functions import count' to ensure all functions are properly imported."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"These outputs serve different purposes and cannot be meaningfully compared. Consider providing comparable outputs (both test suites or both error messages) for valid comparison."
