Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent 1 provides a simple error message indicating a missing file, while Agent 2 delivers comprehensive test cases with pytest implementation for Snowflake to PySpark conversion testing. The outputs serve completely different purposes with no semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent 1 addresses a file location issue while Agent 2 provides functional test cases for data processing. No shared intent, purpose, or domain overlap. Agent 1 focuses on file system navigation problems, Agent 2 focuses on comprehensive testing of data transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent 1 uses simple error message format while Agent 2 employs structured test case documentation with ID-description-outcome format plus complete pytest implementation. Fundamentally different organizational approaches with no structural commonalities."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Missing_File_Agent,100,Line 1,"Syntactically correct error message with proper grammar and clear communication of the issue."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Test_Agent,95,"Lines 15-20, 45-50, 85-90","Minor issues: missing import for 'count' function (should be 'from pyspark.sql.functions import count'), and potential datetime timezone considerations in boundary tests. Otherwise well-structured pytest code with proper fixtures and assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Missing_File_Agent,,Line 1,"Provide specific file path verification steps and suggest alternative file locations or naming conventions to resolve the missing file issue."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Test_Agent,,"Lines 15-20, 85-90","Add explicit import for 'count' function and consider timezone-aware datetime handling for more robust boundary condition testing."
