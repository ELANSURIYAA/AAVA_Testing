Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Summary and Agent_2_Detailed_Review provide comprehensive analyses of Snowflake to PySpark conversion accuracy. Agent_1_Summary offers a concise 7-point structured assessment, while Agent_2_Detailed_Review provides more granular analysis with detailed sections. Both identify key conversion elements, discrepancies, and optimization opportunities. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment in identifying core conversion issues like error handling, performance considerations, and business logic preservation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing Snowflake to PySpark conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Agent_1_Summary uses numbered sections (1-7) covering Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost. Agent_2_Detailed_Review uses descriptive headers covering Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, and Recommendations. Both identify the same key issues: error handling gaps, temporary table vs DataFrame differences, cursor iteration vs collect() performance concerns, and date calculation variations. The semantic intent and conclusions are nearly identical, with minor differences in emphasis and detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Section organization,"Both outputs follow similar logical progression: Summary → Conversion Accuracy → Discrepancies → Optimization → Assessment → Recommendations. Agent_1_Summary uses numbered list format (1-7) with concise bullet points under each section. Agent_2_Detailed_Review uses descriptive section headers with more detailed prose explanations. Both maintain consistent internal structure within sections, presenting issues systematically. Agent_1_Summary includes unique API Cost section (line 25-26), while Agent_2_Detailed_Review includes complete Snowflake procedure code reference (lines 47-67). The overall flow and decomposition approach are highly similar despite different formatting styles."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Summary,95,Lines 1-26,"Agent_1_Summary demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper numbered structure, consistent formatting, and clear section delineation. All internal references are accurate and well-formed. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point usage within sections, but no syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Detailed_Review,98,Lines 1-67,"Agent_2_Detailed_Review shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper Markdown-style headers, consistent formatting throughout, and well-structured content organization. All code references and technical terms are properly formatted. Complete Snowflake procedure code is syntactically valid. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 96. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Summary,N/A,Lines 20-24,"Strengthen error handling recommendations with specific implementation examples. Consider expanding performance optimization suggestions beyond basic caching and partitioning. Add more detailed testing strategies for large dataset validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Detailed_Review,N/A,Lines 34-46,"Excellent comprehensive recommendations covering performance, error handling, and production considerations. Consider adding specific code examples for suggested optimizations. Include estimated performance impact metrics for recommended changes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All sections,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Specific code examples demonstrating recommended optimizations, 2) Quantitative performance benchmarks for suggested improvements, 3) Prioritization framework for implementing recommendations based on impact and effort, 4) Integration testing strategies for validating conversion accuracy in production environments."
