Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Summary and Agent_2_Detailed provide comprehensive analyses of a Snowflake to PySpark conversion. Agent_1_Summary offers a concise structured approach with numbered sections, while Agent_2_Detailed provides more granular technical analysis with clear section headers. Both agents identify the same core conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address identical conversion analysis goals with highly aligned semantic intent. Both identify the same core functionality (filtering recent orders, customer aggregation, summary generation), same discrepancies (error handling, temporary table differences, performance considerations), and similar optimization recommendations. Minor differences in emphasis and detail level but fundamentally same understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Agent_1_Summary uses numbered sections (1-7) with subsections, while Agent_2_Detailed uses clear section headers with dashes. Both follow logical flow: Summary → Conversion Accuracy → Discrepancies → Optimizations → Assessment → Recommendations. Agent_2_Detailed includes additional sections (API Cost breakdown, complete code reference) and more granular subsections within main topics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Summary,95,Lines 15-16,"Minor technical imprecision: states 'past 30 days' filtering consistently but doesn't address the subtle difference between DATEADD(MONTH, -1) vs date_sub(30 days). Otherwise syntactically correct with proper technical terminology and accurate analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Detailed,98,Lines 25-27,"Highly accurate with explicit acknowledgment of date calculation differences ('last 30 days' vs 'last calendar month'). Provides complete code reference and precise technical details. Minor formatting inconsistency in section headers (some use dashes, others don't)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive analysis. Agent_2_Detailed slightly more precise in technical details and edge case identification."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Summary,N/A,Lines 20-24,"Strengthen technical precision by addressing subtle differences in date calculations. Consider expanding error handling discussion beyond basic try-except blocks to include schema validation and data quality checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Detailed,N/A,Lines 45-52,"Maintain the excellent level of technical detail and code references. Consider adding estimated performance impact quantification for optimization suggestions to help prioritize implementation efforts."
