Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs provide comprehensive analyses of a Snowflake to PySpark conversion, identifying similar strengths and improvement areas. Analysis_Output_1 focuses on structured numbered sections with API cost tracking, while Analysis_Output_2 provides more detailed technical analysis with complete source code inclusion."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 25-35 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: evaluating Snowflake to PySpark conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Minor differences in emphasis on performance vs completeness, but conclusions align on conversion success with improvement opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Nearly identical logical flow: Summary → Conversion Accuracy → Discrepancies → Optimizations → Assessment → Recommendations. Analysis_Output_1 uses numbered sections (1., 2., etc.), Analysis_Output_2 uses descriptive headers with dashes. Both maintain consistent section organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Analysis_Output_1,95,"Lines 1-50","Well-formed documentation structure with consistent formatting. Minor deduction for less detailed technical references and limited code examples compared to comprehensive analysis standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Analysis_Output_2,98,"Lines 1-100+","Highly comprehensive with complete source code inclusion, detailed technical analysis, and consistent formatting throughout. Minor deduction only for potential over-verbosity in some sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness and internal consistency as documentation artifacts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Analysis_Output_1,,"Lines 40-45","Enhance technical depth by including more specific code examples and detailed line-by-line comparisons. Consider adding more granular performance analysis metrics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Analysis_Output_2,,"Lines 80-100","Maintain comprehensive approach while considering more concise presentation of some technical details. The inclusion of complete source code is excellent for reference."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities. Future iterations could benefit from standardized formatting approaches and consistent depth of technical detail across all sections."
