Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of Snowflake to PySpark conversion. Snowflake_to_PySpark_Converter focuses on conversion accuracy and optimization with API cost tracking. Snowflake_to_PySpark_Reviewer provides deeper technical analysis with actual code comparison and detailed recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20 vs 1-30","Both outputs address the same core goal of analyzing Snowflake to PySpark conversion. They cover similar themes: conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. However, Snowflake_to_PySpark_Reviewer provides more technical depth with actual code examples while Snowflake_to_PySpark_Converter focuses more on high-level assessment and API cost tracking."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-200","Both follow similar analytical structure with summary, accuracy assessment, issues identification, and recommendations. However, Snowflake_to_PySpark_Reviewer has more detailed sections including complete code reference and more granular optimization suggestions. Snowflake_to_PySpark_Converter has a more concise structure with API cost tracking."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Converter,95,"Lines 1-50","Well-structured analysis with clear sections. Minor issue: lacks specific technical details about the actual conversion implementation. All statements are syntactically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_to_PySpark_Reviewer,98,"Lines 1-200","Comprehensive and technically accurate analysis. Includes actual code examples and detailed technical comparisons. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in section headers but overall excellent structure and accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
