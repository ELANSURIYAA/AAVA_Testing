Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive analyses of a Snowflake stored procedure to PySpark conversion. Agent_1 delivers a concise 7-section structured review focusing on conversion accuracy and optimization suggestions. Agent_2 provides a more detailed 8-section analysis with extensive technical depth, including complete source code reference and granular discrepancy identification. Both agents correctly identify the core conversion elements: date filtering, customer aggregation, and iterative processing. Key differences include Agent_2's superior technical depth, explicit schema considerations, and more comprehensive optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Both outputs address identical conversion validation goals with highly aligned semantic intent. Both identify the same core business logic preservation: 30-day order filtering, customer-wise aggregation, and summary generation. Agent_1 focuses on high-level conversion accuracy (lines 2-6) while Agent_2 provides granular technical mapping (lines 7-15). Minor semantic divergence in optimization emphasis: Agent_1 emphasizes performance bottlenecks (lines 15-18) while Agent_2 emphasizes production readiness considerations (lines 24-30). Both conclude with similar assessment of successful conversion with optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Section organization,"Both outputs follow similar 6-7 section analytical structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. Agent_1 uses numbered sections (1-7) with concise subsections. Agent_2 uses header-delimited sections with more granular subsection breakdowns. Key structural difference: Agent_2 includes complete source code reference (lines 45-70) and API cost tracking (lines 41-43), while Agent_1 provides API cost summary (line 25). Both maintain logical flow from accuracy assessment to optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 2-6 15-18,"Agent_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-structured numbered sections and consistent formatting. Minor issues: API cost reference (line 25) lacks context about cost units. All technical references are accurate including DataFrame operations, date filtering syntax, and performance considerations. Bullet point formatting is consistent throughout optimization suggestions (lines 15-18)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 7-15 45-70,"Agent_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section headers, and comprehensive technical accuracy. All code references are syntactically correct including Snowflake SQL syntax (lines 45-70) and PySpark DataFrame operations (lines 7-15). API cost tracking format is properly structured (lines 41-43). Minor formatting inconsistency in section delimiter lengths."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate technical references, and consistent internal structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting variations and context gaps in cost reporting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-18,"Enhance technical depth by adding explicit schema considerations and production deployment guidelines. Include complete source code references for better context. Expand optimization suggestions to cover logging and error handling best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 24-30,"Maintain excellent technical depth while improving structural consistency in section formatting. Consider adding quantitative performance metrics to optimization suggestions. Enhance API cost reporting with comparative analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All sections,"Both agents should standardize section formatting approaches and enhance cross-referencing between technical recommendations and business impact. Consider developing unified templates for conversion analysis reporting to improve consistency across similar tasks."
