Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Snowflake to PySpark conversion. Output_1 offers concise structured analysis with 7 sections including API cost tracking. Output_2 provides more detailed technical analysis with complete source code reference and enhanced error handling discussion. Both identify same core conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization needs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-30,"Both outputs address identical conversion analysis goals with same core findings: accurate business logic preservation, similar discrepancies (error handling, temporary tables, cursor iteration), and comparable optimization suggestions. Output_2 provides deeper technical detail and includes complete source code, while Output_1 focuses on structured summary format."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both follow similar analytical structure with Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. Output_2 includes additional API Cost Consumed section and complete source code appendix. Flow and logical decomposition are highly aligned with minor organizational differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 1-30,"Well-structured analysis with clear section headers, accurate technical assessment, proper identification of conversion issues. Minor deduction for less detailed error handling discussion and missing source code reference for complete validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,Lines 1-50,"Comprehensive analysis with detailed technical accuracy, complete source code inclusion for verification, thorough error handling discussion, and proper API cost tracking. Excellent internal consistency and reference completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical analysis, proper identification of conversion challenges, and valid optimization recommendations. Output_2 slightly superior due to completeness and source code inclusion."
