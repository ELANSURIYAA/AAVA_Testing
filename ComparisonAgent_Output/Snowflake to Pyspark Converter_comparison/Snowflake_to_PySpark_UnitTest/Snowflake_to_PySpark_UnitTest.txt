# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage and implementation quality compared to Agent 1. While both agents generate pytest scripts for PySpark order processing functionality, Agent 2 provides more comprehensive test scenarios (8 vs 6), better error handling, more realistic data generation, and superior code organization. Agent 2 includes critical edge cases like missing columns and boundary conditions that Agent 1 omits.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both agents address the same core objective of testing PySpark order processing with date filtering and customer aggregation. However, they differ in scope and approach. Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality testing with simpler scenarios, while Agent 2 provides comprehensive coverage including error handling and boundary conditions. The semantic intent overlaps significantly but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of testing requirements.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both agents use pytest framework with similar fixture patterns and test function structure. However, Agent 2 employs a more sophisticated approach with separate helper functions (create_orders_df, run_order_summary) and better separation of concerns. Agent 1 uses inline DataFrame creation and direct operations within each test. The overall flow is similar but implementation patterns differ significantly.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 85/100)**: Agent 1 has mostly correct syntax but contains logical issues: Line 15 uses hardcoded date comparison that may fail depending on execution time, Line 25 uses count(lit(1)) instead of standard count(*), Line 35 has potential issues with date filtering logic that could cause test failures.

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100)**: Agent 2 has excellent syntax and structure with minor issues: Line 20 uses count function without import alias which could cause confusion, Line 45 has proper exception handling but could be more specific about expected exception types.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 90/100)**: Average correctness score across both agents, with Agent 2 showing significantly better implementation practices and fewer potential runtime issues.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 65 |
| Correctness | 85 | 95 | 90 |
| **Overall** | **75** | **85** | **80** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1**: Improve date handling logic to use relative dates consistently, replace count(lit(1)) with standard count(*) for better readability, add more comprehensive edge cases including error handling scenarios, implement helper functions for better code organization.

**For Agent 2**: Add more specific exception type checking in error handling tests, consider adding performance-related test cases for large datasets, include more detailed assertions for complex scenarios, maintain the excellent structure and comprehensive coverage approach.

**Overall**: Agent 2 represents the superior implementation with better practices, comprehensive coverage, and more maintainable code structure. Organizations should adopt Agent 2's approach as the standard for PySpark testing implementations.
