# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. This analysis demonstrates the expected format structure for future comparisons.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The evaluation would typically analyze:
- Intent alignment between outputs
- Reasoning approach consistency  
- Outcome and conclusion alignment
- Task understanding convergence

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The evaluation would typically analyze:
- Logical flow and organization patterns
- Decomposition and modularization approach
- Control flow structures
- Component hierarchy and relationships

### Correctness
**Snowflake_Agent:** N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content
**PySpark_Agent:** N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content  
**Overall:** N/A/100 - Cannot calculate average without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Snowflake_Agent | PySpark_Agent | Overall |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Supply complete agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Include Complete Content**: Ensure agent outputs contain full code/documentation with proper syntax for validation.

3. **Add Structure Markers**: Include line numbers or clear structural markers for precise reference and annotation.

4. **Specify Quality Criteria**: Define expected output format and quality standards for targeted evaluation.
