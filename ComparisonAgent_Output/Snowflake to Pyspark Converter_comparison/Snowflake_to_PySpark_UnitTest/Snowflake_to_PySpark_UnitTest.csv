Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content. This analysis template demonstrates the expected CSV format structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze intent alignment, reasoning approaches, and outcome consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness average without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison analysis. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain complete code/documentation for syntax validation. 3. Include line numbers or clear structure markers for precise reference. 4. Specify expected output format and quality criteria for targeted evaluation."
