Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are comprehensive test suites for PySpark order processing functionality. Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1 provides 6 focused test cases with detailed descriptions and a well-structured pytest implementation. Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2 offers 8 test cases with broader coverage including error handling and boundary conditions. Both demonstrate strong understanding of testing principles but differ in scope and implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs target the same core functionality - testing PySpark order processing with date filtering and customer aggregation. Agent 1 focuses on core scenarios (filtering, distinct customers, aggregation, empty data, nulls, boundary values) while Agent 2 expands coverage to include error handling (TC06), exact boundary conditions (TC07), and duplicate handling (TC08). The semantic intent is highly aligned with 85% overlap in testing objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both follow similar pytest structure with fixtures and individual test functions. Agent 1 uses module-scope fixture (line 8) while Agent 2 uses function-scope (line 10). Agent 1 has more detailed test case documentation format with numbered IDs, descriptions, input/output specifications. Agent 2 uses a more concise documentation style but includes additional helper functions like create_orders_df (line 15) and run_order_summary (line 18). Structure differs in organization but follows same testing patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1,90,Lines 23-24,"Syntax is mostly correct with proper pytest structure and PySpark operations. Minor issue: line 23-24 uses datetime.now() without proper date comparison logic for 30-day filtering which may cause test instability. All other syntax elements including imports, fixtures, and assertions are properly formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2,95,N/A,"Excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, fixture setup, and PySpark operations. Uses expr('date_sub(current_timestamp(), 30)') for robust date filtering (line 21). All test functions are well-formed with appropriate assertions and error handling. Only minor consideration is the use of count('*') vs count(lit(1)) but both are valid approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score of 92. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with proper pytest and PySpark syntax. Agent 2 shows slightly better implementation practices with more robust date handling and comprehensive test coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1,N/A,Lines 23-24,"Improve date filtering logic to use more robust date comparison methods similar to Agent 2's approach. Consider expanding test coverage to include error handling scenarios and boundary conditions. Maintain the excellent documentation format which provides clear test specifications."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive coverage. Consider adopting Agent 1's detailed test case documentation format for better traceability. The current approach with helper functions and robust date handling represents best practices for PySpark testing."
