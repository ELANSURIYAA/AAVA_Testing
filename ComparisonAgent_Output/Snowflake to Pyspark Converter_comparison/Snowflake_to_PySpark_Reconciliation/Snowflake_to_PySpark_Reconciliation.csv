Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content. A proper comparison requires the actual outputs from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meaning, intent, and purpose of both outputs to determine alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure input preprocessing replaces all template variables with real content. 3. Verify data pipeline integrity before invoking comparison analysis. 4. Re-run analysis once valid agent outputs are available."
