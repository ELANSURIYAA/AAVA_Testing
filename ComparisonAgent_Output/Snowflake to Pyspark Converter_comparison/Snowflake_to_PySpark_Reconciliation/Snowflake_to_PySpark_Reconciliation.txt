# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs are comprehensive test suites for PySpark order processing functionality. **Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1** provides 6 focused test cases with detailed descriptions and a well-structured pytest implementation. **Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2** offers 8 test cases with broader coverage including error handling and boundary conditions. Both demonstrate strong understanding of testing principles but differ in scope and implementation approach.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs target the same core functionality - testing PySpark order processing with date filtering and customer aggregation. Agent 1 focuses on core scenarios (filtering, distinct customers, aggregation, empty data, nulls, boundary values) while Agent 2 expands coverage to include error handling (TC06), exact boundary conditions (TC07), and duplicate handling (TC08). The semantic intent is highly aligned with 85% overlap in testing objectives.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both follow similar pytest structure with fixtures and individual test functions. Agent 1 uses module-scope fixture (line 8) while Agent 2 uses function-scope (line 10). Agent 1 has more detailed test case documentation format with numbered IDs, descriptions, input/output specifications. Agent 2 uses a more concise documentation style but includes additional helper functions like `create_orders_df` (line 15) and `run_order_summary` (line 18). Structure differs in organization but follows same testing patterns.

### Correctness

**Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1 (Score: 90/100)**
Syntax is mostly correct with proper pytest structure and PySpark operations. Minor issue: lines 23-24 use `datetime.now()` without proper date comparison logic for 30-day filtering which may cause test instability. All other syntax elements including imports, fixtures, and assertions are properly formed.

**Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2 (Score: 95/100)**
Excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, fixture setup, and PySpark operations. Uses `expr('date_sub(current_timestamp(), 30)')` for robust date filtering (line 21). All test functions are well-formed with appropriate assertions and error handling. Only minor consideration is the use of `count('*')` vs `count(lit(1))` but both are valid approaches.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1 | Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 90 | 95 | 92 |
| **Overall** | **83** | **85** | **84** |

## Recommendations

**For Test_Cases_Document_Agent_1:**
- Improve date filtering logic (lines 23-24) to use more robust date comparison methods similar to Agent 2's approach
- Consider expanding test coverage to include error handling scenarios and boundary conditions
- Maintain the excellent documentation format which provides clear test specifications

**For Test_Cases_Document_Agent_2:**
- Excellent implementation with comprehensive coverage
- Consider adopting Agent 1's detailed test case documentation format for better traceability
- The current approach with helper functions and robust date handling represents best practices for PySpark testing
