# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Analysis Incomplete - Missing Agent Outputs

The comparison analysis could not be completed due to missing actual agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` that were not replaced with actual content. A proper comparison requires the actual outputs from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meaning, intent, and purpose of both outputs to determine alignment between the agents' understanding and execution of the task.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, decomposition approach, organizational patterns, and the overall architecture of the solutions provided by each agent.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1:** N/A - Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content
- **Agent 2:** N/A - Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content  
- **Overall:** N/A - Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs:** Replace placeholder variables with real content from both agents to enable meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Verify Input Preprocessing:** Ensure the data pipeline properly replaces all template variables with actual agent-generated content before invoking the comparison process.

3. **Check Data Pipeline Integrity:** Validate that the upstream processes are correctly passing agent outputs to the comparison system.

4. **Re-run Analysis:** Once valid agent outputs are available, re-execute this comparison to obtain proper semantic, structural, and correctness scores.
