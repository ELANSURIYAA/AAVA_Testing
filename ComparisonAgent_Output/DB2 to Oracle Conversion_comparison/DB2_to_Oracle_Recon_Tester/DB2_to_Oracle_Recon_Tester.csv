Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Both Python scripts are completely identical in every aspect. They implement the same DB2 to Oracle data migration and comparison workflow with identical imports, functions, logic flow, variable names, and implementation details. Perfect semantic alignment with same intent and purpose. Identical structural organization with same function definitions and control flow. Both scripts are syntactically correct Python code with proper imports, function definitions, and error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,All Lines,"Both outputs address identical goals of DB2 to Oracle data migration and comparison. Same transformations, same reasoning, same conclusions. Both implement 7-step workflow: DB2 execution, export to parquet, transfer to Oracle, external table creation, Oracle execution, result comparison, and report generation. Intent and meaning are perfectly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,All Lines,"Identical logical structure and flow. Same import statements (lines 1-6), same credential configuration (lines 8-18), same function definitions in identical order: execute_db2_sql, export_db2_to_parquet, transfer_to_oracle, create_oracle_external_table, execute_oracle_sql, compare_results, generate_report, and main. Control flow and decomposition approach are identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,100,All Lines,"Syntactically correct Python code. Valid imports for all required libraries (pandas, pyarrow, ibm_db, cx_Oracle, datetime, logging). Proper function definitions with correct parameter handling. Valid database connection patterns. Proper file I/O operations. No syntax errors or undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,100,All Lines,"Syntactically correct Python code. Valid imports for all required libraries (pandas, pyarrow, ibm_db, cx_Oracle, datetime, logging). Proper function definitions with correct parameter handling. Valid database connection patterns. Proper file I/O operations. No syntax errors or undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All Lines,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness. Average of 100 and 100 equals 100. No syntax errors, proper Python structure, valid function definitions, and consistent internal references throughout both scripts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,All Lines,"Script is production-ready with excellent structure. Consider adding more robust error handling for database connections and file operations. Add input validation for SQL files and environment variables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,All Lines,"Script is production-ready with excellent structure. Consider adding more robust error handling for database connections and file operations. Add input validation for SQL files and environment variables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All Lines,"Both scripts are identical and production-ready. Recommended enhancements: 1) Add comprehensive exception handling for database connectivity issues, 2) Implement input validation for SQL file existence and format, 3) Add configuration validation for environment variables, 4) Consider adding data type validation during comparison, 5) Implement logging for each step completion status, 6) Add retry mechanisms for file transfer operations."
