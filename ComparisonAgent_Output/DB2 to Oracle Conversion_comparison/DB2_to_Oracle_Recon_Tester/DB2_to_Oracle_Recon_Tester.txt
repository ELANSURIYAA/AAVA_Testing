# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both Python scripts are completely identical in every aspect. They implement the same DB2 to Oracle data migration and comparison workflow with identical imports, functions, logic flow, variable names, and implementation details. Perfect semantic alignment with same intent and purpose. Identical structural organization with same function definitions and control flow. Both scripts are syntactically correct Python code with proper imports, function definitions, and error handling patterns.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 100/100)

Both outputs address identical goals of DB2 to Oracle data migration and comparison. Same transformations, same reasoning, same conclusions. Both implement a 7-step workflow:
1. DB2 SQL execution
2. Export to parquet format
3. Transfer to Oracle Exadata
4. External table creation
5. Oracle SQL execution
6. Result comparison
7. Report generation

The intent and meaning are perfectly aligned across all lines of both scripts.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 100/100)

The logical structure and flow are identical:
- Same import statements (lines 1-6)
- Same credential configuration (lines 8-18)
- Same function definitions in identical order:
  - `execute_db2_sql`
  - `export_db2_to_parquet`
  - `transfer_to_oracle`
  - `create_oracle_external_table`
  - `execute_oracle_sql`
  - `compare_results`
  - `generate_report`
  - `main`

Control flow and decomposition approach are identical throughout.

### Correctness

**First Output: 100/100**
- Syntactically correct Python code
- Valid imports for all required libraries (pandas, pyarrow, ibm_db, cx_Oracle, datetime, logging)
- Proper function definitions with correct parameter handling
- Valid database connection patterns
- Proper file I/O operations
- No syntax errors or undefined variables

**Second Output: 100/100**
- Syntactically correct Python code
- Valid imports for all required libraries (pandas, pyarrow, ibm_db, cx_Oracle, datetime, logging)
- Proper function definitions with correct parameter handling
- Valid database connection patterns
- Proper file I/O operations
- No syntax errors or undefined variables

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | First Output | Second Output | Overall |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Structural Similarity | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **100** | **100** | **100** |

## Recommendations

### For Both Outputs
Since both scripts are identical and production-ready, the following enhancements are recommended:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add comprehensive exception handling for database connectivity issues and file operations
2. **Input Validation**: Implement validation for SQL file existence, format, and environment variables
3. **Configuration Validation**: Add checks for required environment variables before execution
4. **Data Type Validation**: Consider adding data type validation during the comparison phase
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Implement detailed logging for each step completion status
6. **Retry Mechanisms**: Add retry logic for file transfer operations to handle network issues
7. **Security Improvements**: Consider using more secure methods for credential management
8. **Performance Optimization**: Add options for batch processing of large datasets

Both scripts demonstrate excellent structure and are ready for production deployment with the suggested enhancements.
