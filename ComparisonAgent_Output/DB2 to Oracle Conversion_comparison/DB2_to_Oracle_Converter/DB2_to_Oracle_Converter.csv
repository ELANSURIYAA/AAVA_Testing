Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs are identical DB2 to Oracle Exadata Migration Analysis documents. They contain comprehensive migration strategies including executive summary, schema analysis, compatibility assessment, migration strategy, risk assessment, and appendices. The documents are well-structured technical analysis reports with proper formatting and complete coverage of migration considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,,"Both outputs have identical semantic meaning and intent. They address the same DB2 to Oracle migration goals with identical risk assessments (syntax differences, performance optimization, data integrity), same complexity rating (MEDIUM-HIGH), and identical mitigation strategies. All technical content, recommendations, and analysis conclusions are semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,,"Both outputs follow identical structural organization: Executive Summary -> Schema Analysis -> Compatibility Assessment -> Migration Strategy -> Risk Assessment -> Appendices. Section ordering, subsection hierarchy, bullet point structure, and table formatting are identical. Both use the same logical flow and decomposition approach throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_to_Oracle_Converter_Input1,100,,"Output 1 is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid table structure, and no broken links or formatting errors. All technical syntax examples are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_to_Oracle_Converter_Input2,100,,"Output 2 is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid table structure, and no broken links or formatting errors. All technical syntax examples are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Average correctness score is 100."
