Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of DB2 to Oracle Exadata conversion with high semantic alignment (92/100), identical structural organization (98/100), and excellent syntactic correctness (100/100 each). Key differences lie in optimization depth and specific technical recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-7 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical conversion analysis task with same core conclusions about accuracy and completeness. Minor semantic differences in optimization emphasis: Output 1 mentions specific hints like PARALLEL(8) and RESULT_CACHE, while Output 2 focuses on broader Oracle Exadata feature utilization. Both conclude conversion is accurate but could benefit from optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-7 (both outputs)","Nearly identical 7-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, Cost Consumed. Same numbering scheme and logical flow. Minor difference in section 3 where Output 1 states 'No discrepancies' while Output 2 mentions 'does not fully leverage Oracle Exadata's advanced features'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,100,,"Perfect syntax with proper formatting, consistent punctuation, complete sentences, and no broken references or undefined terms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,100,,"Perfect syntax with proper formatting, consistent punctuation, complete sentences, and no broken references or undefined terms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with no formatting issues, broken references, or structural problems."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,Lines 4-6,"Strengthen optimization recommendations by including specific Oracle Exadata features beyond parallel hints. Consider adding more detailed performance testing guidelines."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,Lines 3-4,"Enhance discrepancy analysis to be more specific about potential conversion risks. The statement about 'not fully leveraging Oracle Exadata features' could be more concrete with examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs would benefit from including specific performance metrics, detailed testing procedures, and more granular optimization strategies tailored to different data volumes and query patterns."
