Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-95 vs 1-80","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case lists and pytest scripts for database testing focused on customer segmentation and sales analysis. Output 1 includes 7 test cases while Output 2 has 6 test cases. Both use cx_Oracle connectivity and follow similar testing patterns with minor structural and implementation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30 vs 1-25","Both outputs address the same core testing objectives: customer age group segmentation, sales analysis calculations, NULL value handling, customer lifetime value segmentation, and performance testing. Output 1 includes an additional test case (TC007) for months_since_last_purchase calculation. The semantic intent and purpose are highly aligned with minor scope differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 31-95 vs 26-80","Both follow similar pytest structure with database connection fixtures and individual test functions. Output 1 uses a helper function execute_query() for code reuse (lines 38-43), while Output 2 implements cursor operations directly in each test. Output 1 has more modular structure but both maintain logical test organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,92,"Lines 44-95","Syntax is valid with proper pytest decorators, cx_Oracle usage, and Python structure. Minor issue: hardcoded expected values in assertions (line 50) may not match actual data. Connection string parameters are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,88,"Lines 27-80","Syntax is valid with correct pytest structure and cx_Oracle implementation. Issues include: incomplete assertion logic in TC002 (lines 40-44) with generic >= 0 checks instead of specific validations, and assumption in TC003 comment (line 49) that may not reflect actual requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores","Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper Python and pytest structure. Minor issues in assertion specificity and hardcoded values prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Lines 50, 95","Replace hardcoded expected values in assertions with parameterized or calculated expected results to improve test reliability and maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Lines 40-44, 49","Enhance TC002 assertions with specific expected value validations instead of generic >= 0 checks. Clarify TC003 NULL handling assumptions and implement appropriate validation logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 35-37 vs 30-32","Consider standardizing database connection parameters and implementing environment-specific configuration management for better deployment flexibility."
