Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents produced comprehensive test documentation and pytest scripts for database testing scenarios. Agent 1 provided 7 test cases in bullet format with detailed descriptions, while Agent 2 provided 6 test cases in tabular format. Both included functional pytest scripts with database connectivity and test assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of creating test cases and pytest automation for database testing scenarios including customer segmentation, sales analysis, NULL handling, performance testing, and customer ranking. Agent 1 includes an additional test case (TC007) for months_since_last_purchase calculation. The semantic intent and domain coverage are highly aligned with minor differences in scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Agent 1 uses bullet-point format for test case documentation while Agent 2 uses tabular format. Both follow similar pytest script structure with database fixtures, helper functions, and individual test methods. Agent 1 has more detailed test case descriptions and includes a helper function execute_query(), while Agent 2 embeds SQL execution directly in test methods. Overall flow and decomposition approach are similar but with different organizational constructs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45-47, 89-91","Minor syntax issues: Line 45-47 shows inconsistent indentation in the execute_query helper function. Line 89-91 has a potential issue with hardcoded expected results that may not match actual database state. Otherwise, Python syntax is valid, imports are correct, and SQL queries are well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,90,"Lines 35-37, 67-69, 85-87","Table format is properly structured. Python syntax is valid with correct imports. Minor issues: Line 35-37 shows potential logic flaw in NULL handling test expecting 0 results. Lines 67-69 and 85-87 have hardcoded segmentation thresholds that may not align with actual business logic. SQL syntax is correct throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic validity with minor issues in hardcoded expectations and test logic assumptions."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,,"Standardize indentation in helper functions. Replace hardcoded expected results with dynamic database queries or parameterized test data. Consider adding more descriptive test case documentation similar to Agent 2's tabular format."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,,"Review NULL handling test logic - expecting zero NULL values may not reflect realistic scenarios. Validate segmentation thresholds against actual business requirements. Consider adding the months_since_last_purchase test case present in Agent 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both agents should implement database state setup/teardown procedures. Add data-driven test approaches to reduce hardcoded expectations. Include edge case testing for boundary conditions in age groups and revenue thresholds. Consider adding integration test scenarios that validate end-to-end data flow."
