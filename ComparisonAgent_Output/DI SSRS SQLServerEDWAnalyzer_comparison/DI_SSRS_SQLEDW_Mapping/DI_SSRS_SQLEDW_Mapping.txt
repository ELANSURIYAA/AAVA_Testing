# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs are EDW and SSRS analysis summaries with nearly identical structure and content. The primary difference lies in how they handle the absence of SSRS references - Output 1 uses '*None*' placeholders while Output 2 explicitly states '*No SSRS RDL files provided*'. Both conclude that all EDW tables and columns are unreferenced by SSRS reports and provide similar optimization recommendations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs convey the same core analytical message about unreferenced EDW objects. Output 1 (lines 4-8) uses generic '*None*' entries while Output 2 (lines 4-8) provides more explicit explanation '*No SSRS RDL files provided*'. The insights sections (lines 200-220) are semantically equivalent with minor wording variations. Both reach identical conclusions about optimization opportunities.

**Key Similarities:**
- Both identify all EDW tables as unreferenced by SSRS reports
- Identical recommendations for optimization and next steps
- Same analytical framework and approach

**Minor Differences:**
- Output 1: Uses "*None*" placeholders in referenced tables section
- Output 2: Uses "*No SSRS RDL files provided*" for clearer explanation

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Nearly identical markdown structure with same section headers, table formats, and logical flow. Both use identical table schemas for 'Referenced Tables and Columns' and 'Unreferenced Tables and Columns'. The unreferenced tables list (lines 10-190) is byte-for-byte identical. Only difference is content within the referenced tables section (lines 4-8).

**Structural Elements:**
- Identical markdown headers and formatting
- Same table structures and column layouts
- Consistent bullet point formatting in recommendations
- Identical ordering of sections and content flow

### Correctness

**Output 1: 100/100**
- Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting
- Consistent header structure and valid bullet points
- All internal references are consistent with no formatting errors

**Output 2: 100/100**
- Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting  
- Consistent header structure and valid bullet points
- All internal references are consistent with no formatting errors

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Output_1 | Output_2 | Overall |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **97** | **97** | **97** |

## Recommendations

**For Output 1 (lines 4-8):** Consider using more descriptive messaging instead of '*None*' placeholders to improve clarity for stakeholders reviewing the analysis.

**For Output 2 (lines 4-8):** The explicit explanation '*No SSRS RDL files provided*' is more informative and should be maintained as it clearly communicates the reason for no references.

**For Both (lines 200-220):** Both outputs provide valuable optimization recommendations. Consider standardizing the messaging approach across similar analyses to ensure consistency in enterprise reporting.
