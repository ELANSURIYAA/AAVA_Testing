Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs are EDW and SSRS analysis summaries with nearly identical structure and content. The primary difference lies in how they handle the absence of SSRS references - Output 1 uses '*None*' placeholders while Output 2 explicitly states '*No SSRS RDL files provided*'. Both conclude that all EDW tables and columns are unreferenced by SSRS reports and provide similar optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 4-8 and Lines 200-220,"Both outputs convey the same core analytical message about unreferenced EDW objects. Output 1 (lines 4-8) uses generic '*None*' entries while Output 2 (lines 4-8) provides more explicit explanation '*No SSRS RDL files provided*'. The insights sections (lines 200-220) are semantically equivalent with minor wording variations. Both reach identical conclusions about optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,Lines 1-220,"Nearly identical markdown structure with same section headers, table formats, and logical flow. Both use identical table schemas for 'Referenced Tables and Columns' and 'Unreferenced Tables and Columns'. The unreferenced tables list (lines 10-190) is byte-for-byte identical. Only difference is content within the referenced tables section (lines 4-8)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,100,,"Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting, consistent header structure, and valid bullet points. All internal references are consistent and no formatting errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,,"Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting, consistent header structure, and valid bullet points. All internal references are consistent and no formatting errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown formatting, proper table structures, and consistent internal references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,Lines 4-8,"Consider using more descriptive messaging instead of '*None*' placeholders to improve clarity for stakeholders reviewing the analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 4-8,"The explicit explanation '*No SSRS RDL files provided*' is more informative and should be maintained as it clearly communicates the reason for no references."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 200-220,"Both outputs provide valuable optimization recommendations. Consider standardizing the messaging approach across similar analyses to ensure consistency in enterprise reporting."
