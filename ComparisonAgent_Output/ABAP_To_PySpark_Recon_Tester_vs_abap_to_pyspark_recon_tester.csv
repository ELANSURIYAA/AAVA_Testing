Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,96,,"Both ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester and abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester outputs address the same core objective—automated validation and reconciliation for ABAP to PySpark migration. Semantic similarity is high (95/100), with both scripts covering all validation stages and robust error handling. Structural similarity is strong (92/100); both use modular functions/classes and sequence, but abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester emphasizes config-driven execution and environment integration, while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester is more monolithic. Syntax correctness is nearly perfect for both (100/100 and 98/100); abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester contains a minor issue in local file transfer logic (see lines 137–141). Overall score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs implement a comprehensive migration validation process, including parsing, simulated/actual ABAP execution, Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark execution, reconciliation, error handling, and reporting. Minor differences: abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester supports real SAP RFC and S3/HDFS, while ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester simulates these. Both provide test coverage (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester via pytest, abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester via in-script checks)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"1-222 (ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester), 1-209 (abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester)","Both outputs follow a staged pipeline—parse, execute, convert, transfer, load, transform, compare, report. ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester uses a class-based OOP structure, while abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester organizes via functions and a procedural main. abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester provides a more explicit configuration and environment abstraction (see lines 24–74, 109–119)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester,100,,"Script is syntactically valid Python with correct imports, class/method definitions, and no undefined variables. Pytest script is well-formed and runnable. No syntax or reference errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester,98,"137-141","Minor issue: use of os.rename in transfer_to_storage (lines 137–141) may fail if source/dest are on different filesystems. os.replace or shutil.move is safer for cross-device transfers. Otherwise, code is syntactically valid with proper error handling and logging."
