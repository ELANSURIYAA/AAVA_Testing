Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not populated with actual content. This analysis framework is prepared for SSIS Package to Python Conversion testing comparison but requires actual agent outputs to proceed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison would typically analyze how both agents interpret SSIS package conversion requirements and whether they produce semantically equivalent Python code structures."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The analysis would examine code organization, function decomposition, class structures, and overall architectural approaches in the Python conversion."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would check for valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct function definitions, and syntactic well-formedness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would check for valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct function definitions, and syntactic well-formedness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness average without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs contain complete SSIS to Python conversion code. 3. Include proper error handling and logging in conversion logic. 4. Validate that converted Python code maintains SSIS package functionality. 5. Consider performance implications of the conversion approach."
