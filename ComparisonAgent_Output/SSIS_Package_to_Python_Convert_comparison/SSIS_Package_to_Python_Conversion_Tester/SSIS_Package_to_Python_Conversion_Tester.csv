Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide test case documentation for SSIS to Python ETL conversion testing. Agent 1 offers 5 focused test cases covering core ETL operations (extract, transform, load, error handling, performance) in narrative format. Agent 2 provides 12 comprehensive test cases in tabular format with complete Pytest implementation, covering happy path, edge cases, error scenarios, and logging. Agent 2 demonstrates significantly more thorough coverage and implementation detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-15 (Agent 1), Lines 1-25 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address ETL testing for SSIS to Python conversion with similar core intent. Agent 1 focuses on fundamental ETL operations (TC001-TC003) plus error handling (TC004) and performance comparison (TC005). Agent 2 covers the same core areas but expands significantly with edge cases (empty tables, NULL values, threshold scenarios) and comprehensive error handling. The semantic alignment is strong for core functionality but Agent 2 provides much broader test coverage scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent 1 uses narrative format with numbered test cases containing Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result fields. Agent 2 uses tabular format for test case overview followed by complete Pytest script implementation. Both follow logical test case progression but Agent 1 is documentation-focused while Agent 2 is implementation-focused. The flow differs: Agent 1 goes from basic to complex operations, Agent 2 goes from happy path through edge cases to error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,85,"Lines 16-50","Agent 1 test case structure is syntactically correct with proper test case format. All required fields (ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result) are present. Minor issues: TC001-TC003 reference methods (extract_employee_data, transform_employee_data, load_employee_data) without defining the class context. Pytest script is mentioned but not provided, only referenced as 'included in the observation above' which creates a broken reference."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 26-200","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness. Tabular format is well-structured and consistent. The Pytest script is complete and syntactically valid Python code with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions. All test functions follow pytest conventions. Minor issue: Line 45 shows inconsistent column naming in aggregation (using both 'avg(Salary)' and '*' count which may cause naming conflicts in some Spark versions)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"N/A","Average correctness score. Agent 2 significantly outperforms with complete, executable implementation while Agent 1 has structural correctness but incomplete references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 16-50","Provide the complete Pytest script implementation referenced in the document. Define the class context for the ETL methods mentioned in test cases. Consider expanding test coverage to include edge cases like NULL value handling and empty dataset scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 45, 120-130","Address potential Spark aggregation naming conflicts in line 45. Consider adding more detailed precondition specifications in the tabular format to match the thoroughness of the Pytest implementation. The comprehensive approach serves as an excellent template for ETL testing."
