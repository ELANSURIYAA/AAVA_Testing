Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two test case documents for SSIS to Python ETL conversion. Agent_1_Output provides 5 basic test cases with simple structure, while Agent_2_Output delivers 12 comprehensive test cases in tabular format plus complete pytest implementation. Agent_2_Output demonstrates superior completeness, structure, and implementation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-25 vs Lines 1-50","Both outputs address ETL testing requirements but with different scope and depth. Agent_1_Output covers core ETL operations (extract, transform, load, error handling, performance) while Agent_2_Output expands to include edge cases, comprehensive error scenarios, and logging validation. Both share common intent for data validation and error handling but Agent_2_Output provides more thorough coverage of testing scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-25 vs Lines 1-200","Agent_1_Output uses numbered list format with consistent structure (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status). Agent_2_Output uses professional table format for test cases followed by complete pytest script implementation. While both follow logical test case structure, the presentation formats and completeness levels differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,85,"Lines 1-25","Well-formed test case structure with proper fields. Minor issues: TC005 lacks specific technical details for performance measurement methodology. All test cases follow consistent format and contain required elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,"Lines 1-200","Excellent technical implementation with proper pytest syntax, comprehensive fixtures, and complete test coverage. Minor syntax consideration: some test assertions could be more specific. The pytest script demonstrates professional testing practices with proper mocking and edge case handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"All lines","Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with Agent_2_Output showing superior technical implementation depth."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,"Lines 20-25","Enhance TC005 with specific performance metrics and measurement criteria. Add more edge cases and error scenarios. Consider implementing actual pytest code for automated execution."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,"Lines 150-200","Excellent comprehensive approach. Minor enhancement: add more specific assertions in some test methods. Consider adding integration test cases that combine multiple ETL steps."
