Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive ETL testing documentation with different approaches. Agent 1 provided 5 focused test cases with basic structure, while Agent 2 delivered 12 detailed test cases in tabular format with complete Pytest implementation. Agent 2 demonstrates superior coverage and implementation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-30 (Agent 1), Lines 1-50 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address ETL process testing with similar core objectives: data extraction, transformation, loading, and error handling. Agent 1 focuses on basic ETL validation (TC001-TC003) and error handling (TC004), plus performance comparison (TC005). Agent 2 covers similar ground but expands significantly with edge cases, comprehensive error scenarios, and logging validation. The semantic intent aligns well but Agent 2 provides broader coverage of testing scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-15 (Agent 1), Lines 1-25 (Agent 2)","Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent 1 uses numbered list format with standard test case fields (ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status). Agent 2 employs tabular format with similar fields but more systematic organization. Agent 1 mentions Pytest script but doesn't provide implementation, while Agent 2 includes complete 200+ line Pytest implementation with fixtures, mocks, and comprehensive test functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,85,"Lines 1-30","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper test case structure. Minor issues: TC005 description is somewhat vague about 'comparable or better' performance criteria. Test case format is consistent and follows standard conventions. Pytest script reference exists but implementation is not provided, making it incomplete for actual execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 1-300","Agent 2 output demonstrates high syntactic correctness. Test case table format is well-structured and consistent. The Pytest implementation is comprehensive with proper imports, fixtures, schema definitions, and test functions. Minor issues: Some test functions could benefit from more specific assertions (lines 180-190), and mock usage could be more explicit in some edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both outputs being syntactically sound with Agent 2 showing superior implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,"Lines 20-25","Enhance test case coverage by adding edge cases and error scenarios similar to Agent 2's approach. Provide complete Pytest implementation rather than just mentioning it. Add more specific performance criteria for TC005."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,"Lines 150-200","Strengthen assertion specificity in some test functions. Consider adding more explicit mock configurations for error simulation scenarios. Add integration test cases that combine multiple ETL steps."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized test case format alignment, 2) Performance benchmarking criteria definition, 3) Data quality validation test cases, 4) Continuous integration pipeline integration considerations."
