Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two ETL testing approaches: Agent_1 provides basic test case structure with 5 test cases focusing on core ETL operations, while Agent_2 delivers comprehensive testing framework with 12 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation. Agent_2 demonstrates superior coverage, structure, and implementation completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs address ETL testing requirements but with different semantic approaches. Agent_1 focuses on basic ETL operations (lines 1-25) covering extract, transform, load, error handling, and performance testing. Agent_2 provides comprehensive ETL testing coverage (lines 1-12 table, lines 14-200+ pytest script) including happy path, edge cases, null handling, error scenarios, and logging. Both understand the core ETL testing intent but Agent_2 demonstrates deeper semantic understanding of comprehensive testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,N/A,"Significant structural differences between outputs. Agent_1 uses simple numbered list format (lines 1-25) with basic test case structure including ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status. Agent_2 employs structured tabular format (lines 1-12) followed by comprehensive pytest implementation (lines 14-200+) with fixtures, helper functions, and detailed test methods. Agent_2 shows professional testing framework structure while Agent_1 uses basic documentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,Lines 1-25,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper test case documentation format. All test cases (TC001-TC005) follow consistent structure with required fields. Minor issues: lacks detailed implementation specifics and pytest script is only mentioned but not provided in detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 1-200+,"Agent_2 output demonstrates high syntactic correctness. Table format is properly structured (lines 1-12), pytest script shows correct Python syntax, proper imports, fixtures, and test methods (lines 14-200+). Minor deduction for some mock implementations that could be more robust, but overall excellent code quality and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both outputs being syntactically sound with Agent_2 showing superior implementation completeness and Agent_1 providing adequate basic structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Agent_1 should enhance test coverage by adding edge cases, error scenarios, and null handling tests. Implement detailed pytest script with fixtures and helper functions. Consider adopting tabular format for better readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-200+,"Agent_2 demonstrates excellent comprehensive approach. Minor improvements could include adding performance benchmarking tests and more detailed error message validation. Consider adding integration test scenarios and data quality validation tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from standardizing on Agent_2's comprehensive approach while incorporating Agent_1's performance testing focus. Recommend adopting Agent_2's structured format and detailed pytest implementation as the standard for ETL testing documentation and implementation."
