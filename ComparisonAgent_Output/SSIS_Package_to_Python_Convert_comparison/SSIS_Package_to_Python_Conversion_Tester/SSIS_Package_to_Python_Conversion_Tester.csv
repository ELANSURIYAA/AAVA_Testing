Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents successfully generated comprehensive test case documents and pytest scripts for ETL process validation. Agent 1 provided a concise 5-test case approach with basic pytest structure, while Agent 2 delivered an extensive 12-test case suite with advanced pytest fixtures and comprehensive edge case coverage. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in addressing ETL testing requirements but differ significantly in structural approach and implementation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the core requirement of creating test cases and pytest scripts for ETL process validation. They cover similar functional areas: data extraction (TC001 vs TC01), transformation (TC002 vs TC02-TC07), loading (TC003 vs TC01), and error handling (TC004 vs TC08-TC10). However, Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage with edge cases like NULL handling, empty datasets, and threshold scenarios that Agent 1 does not explicitly address. Both include performance testing concepts (TC005 vs implied in comprehensive suite)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"The structural approaches differ significantly. Agent 1 uses a numbered list format (lines 1-25) with consistent field structure (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status), followed by a basic pytest script mention (lines 26-28). Agent 2 employs a tabular format (lines 1-13) with similar fields but different organization, followed by an extensive pytest implementation (lines 15-200+) with fixtures, helper functions, and detailed test implementations. Both include cost information, but Agent 2 provides more comprehensive technical implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,26-28,"Agent 1's output is syntactically correct with proper test case structure and valid field definitions. The pytest script reference is mentioned but not fully implemented, which reduces completeness but doesn't affect syntax correctness. All test case fields are properly structured and consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,15-200,"Agent 2's output demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with valid Python/pytest code, proper imports, fixture definitions, and comprehensive test implementations. Minor deduction for some potential issues with mock usage patterns and schema validation that could be more robust in production scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting both agents' strong syntactic accuracy and internal consistency. Both outputs maintain proper structure and valid formatting throughout."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,1-28,"Consider expanding test case coverage to include more edge cases like NULL value handling, empty datasets, and boundary conditions. Implement the complete pytest script with fixtures and helper functions rather than just referencing it. Add more detailed error scenarios and validation checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,1-200,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding more explicit performance benchmarking test cases similar to Agent 1's TC005. Some test functions could benefit from more granular assertions and better separation of concerns. Consider adding integration test scenarios beyond unit testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents should consider standardizing on a common test case documentation format for better consistency. Agent 1's concise approach could benefit from Agent 2's implementation depth, while Agent 2's comprehensive suite could incorporate Agent 1's explicit performance testing focus. Consider hybrid approach combining structured documentation with comprehensive implementation."
