Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two SSIS to Python ETL conversion test outputs. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent1 provides 5 basic test cases with minimal structure, while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent2 delivers 12 comprehensive test cases with detailed pytest implementation. Both address ETL testing but with significantly different scope and depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-50","Both outputs address SSIS to Python ETL conversion testing with focus on employee data processing. Agent1 covers basic ETL operations (extract, transform, load) and error handling. Agent2 expands this with comprehensive edge cases, error scenarios, and performance testing. Core semantic intent aligns but Agent2 provides broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-200","Agent1 uses simple numbered list format for 5 test cases. Agent2 employs structured table format for 12 test cases plus complete pytest implementation. Both follow test case structure (ID, Description, Steps, Expected Results) but Agent2 adds preconditions and uses more systematic organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent1,85,"Lines 1-30","Test case structure is valid with proper ID, Description, Steps, and Expected Results. Minor issues: incomplete pytest script reference (line 30), some test steps lack specificity (lines 8, 15, 22)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent2,95,"Lines 1-200","Comprehensive test structure with valid table format and complete pytest implementation. Minor syntax issue in pytest fixture scope (line 45), but overall excellent structure and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Agent2 demonstrates superior technical implementation while Agent1 provides adequate basic structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent1,N/A,"Lines 8, 15, 22, 30","Enhance test step specificity, complete pytest script implementation, add edge cases and error scenarios, include performance testing considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Conversion_Tester_Agent2,N/A,"Line 45","Minor fix needed for pytest fixture scope declaration. Consider adding more integration test scenarios and data validation test cases."
