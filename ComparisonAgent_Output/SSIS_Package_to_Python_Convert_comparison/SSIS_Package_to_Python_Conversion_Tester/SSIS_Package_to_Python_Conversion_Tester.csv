Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide test case documentation for ETL processes, with Agent 2 delivering significantly more comprehensive coverage including executable Pytest code. Agent 1 provides basic test case structure while Agent 2 offers production-ready testing framework with 12 detailed test cases covering edge cases and error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-50","Both outputs address ETL testing requirements but with different scope and depth. Agent 1 focuses on high-level test case documentation (5 cases) while Agent 2 provides comprehensive testing framework (12 cases plus executable code). Core intent aligns around validating extract, transform, load operations and error handling, but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of testing requirements including edge cases like NULL handling, empty datasets, and performance validation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-200","Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent 1 uses simple numbered list format with basic test case fields (ID, Description, Preconditions, Steps, Expected Result). Agent 2 employs tabular structure for test cases plus complete Pytest implementation with fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive test methods. Both follow logical test case progression but Agent 2 demonstrates superior organization with separation of concerns between documentation and executable code."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 1-30","Test case structure is syntactically correct with proper field definitions. Minor issues include incomplete actual result and pass/fail status fields (marked as 'To be filled during execution'). Test case descriptions are clear and preconditions are well-defined. No syntax errors in documentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-200","Excellent syntactic correctness with valid Python code structure, proper Pytest fixtures, and correct PySpark syntax. Table format is well-structured and consistent. Minor deduction for potential import path assumptions in line 15 that may need adjustment based on actual module structure. All test methods follow proper naming conventions and assertion patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 20-25","Complete the actual result and pass/fail status fields for production use. Consider adding more edge cases and error scenarios similar to Agent 2's approach. Add executable test code to complement documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 15, 180-190","Verify import paths in line 15 match actual module structure. Consider adding more detailed test case documentation in tabular format to complement the excellent code implementation. Add performance benchmarking assertions in TC05 equivalent test."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent 2 provides superior testing framework suitable for production use. Agent 1's documentation approach could be integrated with Agent 2's implementation for complete test suite. Consider combining Agent 1's clear documentation style with Agent 2's comprehensive code coverage."
