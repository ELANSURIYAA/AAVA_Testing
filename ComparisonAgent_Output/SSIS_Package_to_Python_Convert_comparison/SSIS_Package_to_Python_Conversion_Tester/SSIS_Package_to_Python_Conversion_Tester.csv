Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent_1 and Agent_2 both deliver test case documentation for ETL process validation, but with significant differences in scope and implementation quality. Agent_1 provides 5 basic test cases with minimal implementation details, while Agent_2 delivers 12 comprehensive test cases with complete Pytest implementation. Both outputs are syntactically correct but vary substantially in coverage and depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-50","Both outputs address ETL testing requirements but with different interpretations. Agent_1 focuses on basic ETL operations (extract, transform, load, error handling, performance), while Agent_2 provides comprehensive edge case coverage including NULL handling, empty datasets, and error scenarios. Core intent aligns but scope differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-30 vs Lines 1-200","Agent_1 uses simple numbered list format for test cases, while Agent_2 employs structured table format followed by complete Pytest implementation. Both follow test case documentation standards but with different organizational approaches and levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 1-30","Test case structure is valid with proper ID, description, preconditions, steps, and expected results. Minor issues: lacks specific data validation criteria and incomplete Pytest reference (line 28-30)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-200","Comprehensive test documentation with valid table structure and complete Pytest implementation. Minor syntax issue: missing import statement organization in lines 45-50, but overall implementation is syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Expand test coverage to include edge cases and error scenarios. Implement complete Pytest framework with fixtures and proper test structure. Add data validation criteria and specific assertion logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Organize import statements more systematically (lines 45-50). Consider adding performance benchmarking tests. Excellent comprehensive coverage - maintain this standard for future implementations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Agent_2 demonstrates superior implementation with comprehensive coverage and complete code. Agent_1 should adopt similar structured approach and expand test scope significantly."
