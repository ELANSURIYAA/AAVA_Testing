# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not populated with actual content. This analysis framework is prepared for SSIS Package to Python Conversion testing comparison but requires actual agent outputs to proceed.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison would typically analyze how both agents interpret SSIS package conversion requirements and whether they produce semantically equivalent Python code structures.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The analysis would examine code organization, function decomposition, class structures, and overall architectural approaches in the Python conversion.

### Correctness
- **SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would check for valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct function definitions, and syntactic well-formedness.
- **SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would check for valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct function definitions, and syntactic well-formedness.
- **Overall**: N/A/100 - Cannot compute overall correctness average without individual agent scores.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1 | SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide actual agent outputs** for meaningful comparison
2. **Ensure agent outputs contain complete SSIS to Python conversion code** with proper structure
3. **Include proper error handling and logging** in conversion logic
4. **Validate that converted Python code maintains SSIS package functionality**
5. **Consider performance implications** of the conversion approach
