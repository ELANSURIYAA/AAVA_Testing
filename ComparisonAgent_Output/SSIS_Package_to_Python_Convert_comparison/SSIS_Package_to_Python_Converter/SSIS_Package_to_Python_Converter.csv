Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent PySpark_Delta_Lake provides a comprehensive PySpark implementation converting SSIS ETL workflow to Delta Lake operations with proper error handling, logging, and optimization. Agent Empty_Content delivers no functional output, containing only malformed HTML-like tags with no substantive content. The comparison reveals a complete disparity in output quality and functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-3000+,"Agent PySpark_Delta_Lake demonstrates clear understanding of ETL conversion requirements, implementing data warehouse operations, lookups, aggregations, and conditional splits. Agent Empty_Content shows no semantic understanding, providing only repetitive empty HTML tags without any ETL logic or business context. Semantic alignment is minimal as only one agent addresses the task."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-3000+,"Agent PySpark_Delta_Lake follows logical ETL structure: imports, configuration, data reading, transformations, aggregations, and output writing. Agent Empty_Content has no discernible structure beyond repetitive HTML-like tag patterns. The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible with minimal overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Delta_Lake,95,Lines 15-20: Missing import validation,"PySpark code demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, function calls, DataFrame operations, and Delta Lake integration. Minor deduction for potential missing import validation and error handling edge cases in lines 15-20."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Empty_Content,0,Lines 1-3000+: Malformed syntax throughout,"Content consists entirely of malformed HTML-like tags with no valid syntax in any programming language. No functional code elements, proper structure, or executable content present."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,48,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 0) / 2 = 47.5, rounded to 48."

Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Delta_Lake,,"Enhance error handling robustness, add input validation for configuration parameters, implement data quality checks, and consider adding unit tests for transformation logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Empty_Content,,"Complete rewrite required. Agent must provide functional ETL code addressing SSIS to PySpark conversion requirements with proper syntax, structure, and business logic implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Significant disparity in output quality requires investigation of Empty_Content agent's processing capabilities. Consider implementing output validation checks to prevent submission of non-functional content."
