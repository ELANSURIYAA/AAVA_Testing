Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,N/A,"Analysis limited due to incomplete input data. Only one agent output (PySpark Delta Lake code) was clearly identifiable in the provided input. The second agent output appears to be missing or obscured by placeholder text, preventing a comprehensive comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as only one agent output is available for comparison. The provided PySpark code demonstrates clear intent to convert SSIS package functionality to Delta Lake operations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity as only one agent output is available for comparison. The available code shows well-structured ETL workflow with proper separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Delta_Lake_Code,85,"Lines 15-20, 45-50, 70-75","Code demonstrates good Python/PySpark syntax with proper imports and Delta Lake operations. Minor issues: missing error handling for file path validation, hardcoded threshold value could be parameterized, and some variable naming could be more descriptive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Unknown_Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness as the second agent output is not clearly provided in the input data."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,43,N/A,"Average of available scores: (85 + 0) / 2 = 42.5, rounded to 43. Limited by missing second agent output."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Delta_Lake_Code,,Lines 1-10,"Add comprehensive input validation for file paths and configuration parameters before processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Delta_Lake_Code,,Lines 60-65,"Consider parameterizing the HIGH_SALARY_THRESHOLD value through configuration or environment variables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,N/A,"Provide complete agent outputs for meaningful comparison. Current analysis is severely limited by missing data."
