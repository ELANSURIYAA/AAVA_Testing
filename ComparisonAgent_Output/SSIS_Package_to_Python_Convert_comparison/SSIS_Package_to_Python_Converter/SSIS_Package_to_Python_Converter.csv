Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Agent outputs not provided - received placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content. Cannot evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, or correctness without source material."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Received placeholder variables instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Received placeholder variables instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness of Agent 1 output. No content provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness of Agent 2 output. No content provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs are properly formatted and complete. 3. Verify that content variables are correctly substituted before analysis. 4. Re-run comparison once valid inputs are available."
