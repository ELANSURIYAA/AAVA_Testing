Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 output contains malformed content with excessive repeated characters and no meaningful SSIS to Python conversion code. Agent 2 provides a comprehensive PySpark Delta Lake implementation that successfully converts SSIS package functionality to Python with proper ETL workflow, error handling, logging, and Delta Lake optimization. The outputs show fundamental differences in quality and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,,"Agent 1 fails to address the SSIS to Python conversion task with meaningful content (lines 1-3000+ contain repeated characters). Agent 2 successfully interprets and implements the conversion requirement with comprehensive PySpark code including data sources, transformations, lookups, conditional splits, aggregations, and Delta Lake destinations (lines 1-95). The semantic alignment is minimal due to Agent 1's lack of substantive content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,,"Agent 1 lacks any recognizable structure related to SSIS conversion (lines 1-3000+). Agent 2 follows a logical ETL structure: configuration setup (lines 8-15), logging setup (lines 17-28), Spark session initialization (lines 30-36), data reading (lines 42-45), transformations and lookups (lines 47-58), conditional splits (lines 60-63), aggregations (lines 65-77), Delta Lake writes (lines 79-82), and optimization (lines 84-88). No structural similarity exists between the outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,5,"Lines 1-3000+","Agent 1 output consists entirely of malformed content with repeated characters and HTML-like tags, containing no valid Python syntax, imports, or logical code structure. This represents a complete failure to produce syntactically correct output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 3, 31, 65-77","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent Python syntax with proper imports, Spark session configuration, DataFrame operations, and Delta Lake integration. Minor issues: line 3 has a redundant import that could be optimized, line 31 could benefit from additional configuration parameters, and aggregation syntax in lines 65-77 could use more explicit column naming for better readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,50,,"Average correctness score: (5 + 95) / 2 = 50. The significant disparity reflects one completely malformed output versus one highly functional implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Complete reimplementation required. Agent 1 output is entirely unusable and must be rebuilt from scratch with proper Python syntax, PySpark imports, and SSIS conversion logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Minor enhancements recommended: optimize imports (line 3), add more Spark configuration parameters (line 31), improve aggregation column naming (lines 65-77), and consider adding data quality checks and more comprehensive error handling for production deployment."
