Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Analysis limited due to incomplete input data. Only one agent output (PySpark Delta Lake conversion) was clearly identifiable in the provided input. The available output demonstrates a comprehensive SSIS-to-PySpark conversion with proper ETL workflow, error handling, and Delta Lake optimization. Unable to perform comparative analysis between two distinct agent outputs as required."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as only one complete agent output is available. The provided PySpark script shows clear understanding of SSIS package conversion requirements with proper data flow implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity between two outputs as only one complete output is identifiable. The available output follows logical ETL structure with proper session setup, data processing, and cleanup phases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Converter,85,"Lines 1-5, 15-20, 45-50, 80-85","Syntax is mostly correct with proper PySpark and Delta Lake usage. Minor issues: missing import validation, hardcoded threshold values, and potential path validation concerns. Error handling implementation is robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Unknown_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Second agent output not clearly identifiable in provided input data."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,N/A,"Overall correctness limited by availability of only one complete output for evaluation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Converter,N/A,"Lines 15-20, 45","Add input validation for Delta table paths and schema validation. Consider parameterizing hardcoded values like HIGH_SALARY_THRESHOLD. Implement more granular error handling for different failure scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Unknown_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Unable to provide recommendations due to incomplete input data."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Future comparisons require complete outputs from both agents to enable meaningful analysis. Ensure input data contains clearly separated and labeled agent outputs."
