Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Analysis reveals a critical issue: Agent 1 output consists entirely of malformed JSON with thousands of empty braces and no meaningful content, while Agent 2 provides a comprehensive PySpark Delta Lake implementation for SSIS package conversion. This represents a complete failure of Agent 1 to deliver any usable output versus a well-structured, production-ready solution from Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,"Agent 1: Lines 1-3000+, Agent 2: Lines 1-120","Zero semantic similarity as Agent 1 provides no meaningful content - only malformed JSON structure with repetitive empty braces. Agent 2 delivers complete ETL workflow with proper data transformations, lookups, aggregations, and error handling that directly addresses SSIS package conversion requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,"Agent 1: Lines 1-3000+, Agent 2: Lines 1-120","No structural similarity possible. Agent 1 lacks any recognizable structure beyond malformed JSON syntax. Agent 2 follows proper PySpark ETL structure with clear sections: configuration, logging, data processing, transformations, and Delta Lake operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,"Lines 1-3000+","Complete syntax failure. Malformed JSON with unclosed braces, no meaningful content, and no executable code. Represents total failure to meet basic output requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 15, 45, 67","Syntactically correct PySpark code with proper imports, session configuration, and Delta operations. Minor deduction for hardcoded threshold value (line 67) and missing some error handling edge cases (line 45). Overall excellent implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,47.5,,"Average of Agent 1 (0) and Agent 2 (95) scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Complete rework required. Agent 1 failed to produce any meaningful output. Must implement proper SSIS to Python conversion logic with actual code generation capabilities."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent foundation with minor improvements needed: parameterize hardcoded values (line 67), add more comprehensive error handling, and include data validation steps. Consider adding configuration file support for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Agent 2 clearly superior for production use. Agent 1 requires fundamental redesign. For future comparisons, ensure both agents produce valid outputs before evaluation."
