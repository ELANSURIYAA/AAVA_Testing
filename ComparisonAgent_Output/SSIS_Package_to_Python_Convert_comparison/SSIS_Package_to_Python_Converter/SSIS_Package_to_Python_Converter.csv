Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Analysis of SSIS Package to Python conversion outputs. Only one clear agent output (PySpark_Delta_Lake_Agent) was identifiable in the provided input. The second agent output appears to be corrupted or malformed with extensive repetitive characters. This significantly limits the comparison analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot perform semantic similarity analysis due to missing or corrupted second agent output. Only PySpark_Delta_Lake_Agent output is clearly readable."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot perform structural similarity analysis due to missing or corrupted second agent output. Only PySpark_Delta_Lake_Agent output is clearly readable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Delta_Lake_Agent,85,"Lines 1-15: Import statements are syntactically correct. Lines 20-30: Configuration variables properly defined. Lines 45-55: Spark session configuration is valid. Lines 60-80: DataFrame operations use correct PySpark syntax. Lines 85-95: Join operations are properly structured.","PySpark code is syntactically correct with proper imports, Spark session configuration, and DataFrame operations. Minor issues: some hardcoded values that should be parameterized, and error handling could be more granular."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Unknown_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness of second agent output due to corrupted or missing content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,43,,"Average of available scores: (85 + 0) / 2 = 42.5, rounded to 43"

Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Delta_Lake_Agent,,"The PySpark code demonstrates good understanding of Delta Lake operations and ETL patterns. Recommendations: 1) Add more granular error handling for individual operations, 2) Parameterize hardcoded threshold values, 3) Add data quality validation steps, 4) Include more comprehensive logging for debugging."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Unknown_Agent,,"Cannot provide recommendations for the second agent output due to corrupted or missing content. Recommend re-submitting with properly formatted input."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Future comparisons require both agent outputs to be clearly readable and properly formatted. Consider implementing input validation to ensure both outputs are present and parseable before analysis."
