Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs analyze the conversion of an SSIS Employee_Data_Warehouse package to Python. Agent_Summary_Style provides a concise executive summary format, while Agent_Detailed_Style offers a comprehensive numbered analysis. Both conclude the conversion is accurate and well-optimized, with similar recommendations for performance testing and logging enhancements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical goals: analyzing SSIS to Python conversion accuracy. Agent_Summary_Style uses executive summary format while Agent_Detailed_Style uses numbered sections, but core semantic content is highly aligned. Both identify same conversion elements (control flow, data flow, variables, error handling) and reach similar conclusions about accuracy and optimization needs. Minor differences in emphasis on specific technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Agent_Summary_Style uses traditional executive summary structure (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations). Agent_Detailed_Style uses numbered sections (1-7) with subsections and detailed breakdowns. Both follow logical flow from overview to detailed analysis to recommendations, but structural presentation differs significantly. Agent_Detailed_Style includes more granular subsections and tabular complexity metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Summary_Style,95,Lines 1-25,"Well-formed executive summary structure with consistent formatting. All sections properly organized. Minor issue: 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a formatting artifact (lines 8, 23) that should likely be 'report'. Otherwise syntactically sound with proper section headers and coherent content flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Detailed_Style,98,Lines 1-150,"Excellent structural organization with clear numbered sections and consistent formatting. Includes detailed complexity metrics table, comprehensive analysis sections, and proper markdown formatting. All internal references are consistent. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points but overall highly polished and syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_Detailed_Style slightly more polished with better formatting consistency. Both maintain coherent structure throughout their respective formats."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Summary_Style,,"Consider adopting more detailed section breakdowns similar to Agent_Detailed_Style for enhanced readability. Fix formatting artifacts ('ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' should be 'report'). Maintain concise executive summary approach while adding more specific technical details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Detailed_Style,,"Excellent comprehensive analysis structure. Consider adding executive summary section at the beginning for quick overview. Minor formatting consistency improvements needed in bullet point sections. The numbered approach with detailed subsections is highly effective for technical documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable SSIS to Python conversion analysis. Combining Agent_Summary_Style's concise executive approach with Agent_Detailed_Style's comprehensive technical depth would create optimal documentation. Both correctly identify key conversion challenges and optimization opportunities."
