Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS to Python conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) covering identical core topics: conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. Structural approaches differ significantly (65/100) with Summary_Analyzer using descriptive sections versus Detailed_Analyzer's numbered format. Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness (100/100) with no formatting or reference errors. Overall assessment: 83/100 indicates strong alignment with room for structural standardization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Summary_Analyzer), Lines 1-120 (Detailed_Analyzer)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing SSIS package conversion to Python with focus on ETL operations, data warehouse functionality, and employee data processing. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both identify the package as 'Employee_Data_Warehouse' ETL pipeline, (2) Both assess conversion accuracy across control flow tasks, data flow components, and script tasks, (3) Both highlight similar discrepancies (error handling granularity, logging mechanisms, performance considerations), (4) Both provide optimization suggestions (parallel processing, memory management, enhanced logging), (5) Both conclude with positive overall assessment and similar recommendations. Minor semantic differences: Summary_Analyzer emphasizes 'well-optimized conversion' while Detailed_Analyzer focuses on 'completeness and accuracy'. Scoring rationale: High alignment on intent and conclusions with minor emphasis variations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-25 (Summary_Analyzer), Lines 1-60 (Detailed_Analyzer)","Significant structural differences identified: Summary_Analyzer uses descriptive section headers (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations) in flowing narrative format. Detailed_Analyzer employs numbered sections (1. Summary, 2. Conversion Accuracy, etc.) with detailed subsections and bullet points. Flow similarities: Both follow logical progression from overview to detailed analysis to recommendations. Structural differences: (1) Summary_Analyzer uses paragraph format throughout, (2) Detailed_Analyzer includes tabular complexity metrics (lines 25-35), (3) Detailed_Analyzer provides more granular subsections within each major section, (4) Summary_Analyzer integrates cost information inline, Detailed_Analyzer separates it as distinct section. Scoring rationale: Same logical flow but fundamentally different presentation structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Summary_Analyzer,100,,"Complete syntax validation passed. No formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies detected. All sections properly formatted with consistent markdown-style headers. Internal references maintain consistency throughout. Cost information properly integrated. No syntax violations identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Analyzer,100,,"Complete syntax validation passed. Numbered section format properly implemented with consistent hierarchy. Tabular data correctly formatted. All subsections properly nested. Internal cross-references maintain consistency. No markdown formatting errors. API cost section properly separated. No syntax violations identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Summary_Analyzer,,"Enhance structural consistency by adopting standardized section formatting. Consider incorporating detailed complexity metrics similar to Detailed_Analyzer's tabular approach. Maintain current semantic depth while improving structural clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Analyzer,,"Maintain current detailed structural approach while ensuring semantic emphasis aligns with Summary_Analyzer's optimization focus. Consider condensing some subsections for improved readability without losing analytical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Establish common structural template for future SSIS conversion analyses. Both agents demonstrate strong analytical capabilities but would benefit from standardized presentation format. Consider hybrid approach combining Summary_Analyzer's narrative flow with Detailed_Analyzer's detailed subsections."
