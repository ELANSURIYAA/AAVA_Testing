Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS to Python conversion for Employee_Data_Warehouse package. Agent_1 delivers a concise summary-style report covering key conversion aspects, while Agent_2 provides an extensively detailed, structured analysis with granular technical mappings. Both identify similar core issues and optimization opportunities, though with different levels of depth and specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Agent_1: Lines 1-50, Agent_2: Lines 1-200","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing SSIS to Python conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Agent_1 focuses on high-level conversion assessment with business impact, while Agent_2 provides granular technical mappings of SSIS components to Python equivalents. Both reach similar conclusions about conversion feasibility and optimization needs, with Agent_2 offering more specific technical details and comprehensive coverage of edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Agent_1: Lines 1-50, Agent_2: Lines 1-200","Agent_1 uses summary-style organization with basic sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations). Agent_2 employs numbered hierarchical structure (7 main sections with detailed subsections). Both follow logical ETL analysis flow but with significantly different organizational approaches. Agent_2's structure is more systematic and comprehensive, while Agent_1's is more executive-summary oriented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Generally well-formed documentation with minor formatting inconsistencies. Some bullet points lack consistent indentation (lines 15-20). Technical terminology is accurate throughout. Cost reporting format is consistent (line 50)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-200","Highly structured and consistently formatted documentation. Maintains consistent numbering scheme, proper section headers, and systematic organization throughout. Technical details are accurate and well-referenced. Minor issue with table formatting in complexity metrics section (lines 25-35)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness as documentation artifacts. Agent_2 shows superior structural consistency and formatting, while Agent_1 has minor formatting inconsistencies but remains highly readable and technically accurate."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance structural organization with consistent formatting and hierarchical numbering. Expand technical detail sections to provide more granular component mappings. Add specific line references for technical claims."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain excellent structural organization and technical depth. Consider adding executive summary section for stakeholder consumption. Ensure table formatting consistency across all sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable SSIS to Python conversion analysis. Agent_2's comprehensive approach is better suited for technical implementation teams, while Agent_1's concise format serves executive reporting needs. Consider combining approaches for complete stakeholder coverage."
