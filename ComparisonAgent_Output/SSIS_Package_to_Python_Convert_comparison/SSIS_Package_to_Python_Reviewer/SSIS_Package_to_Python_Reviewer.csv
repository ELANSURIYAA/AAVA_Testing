Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs analyze the conversion of an SSIS package 'Employee_Data_Warehouse' to Python implementation. Agent_1 provides a concise 6-section analysis focusing on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization suggestions with an overall positive assessment. Agent_2 delivers a more comprehensive 7-section analysis with detailed component mapping, structured recommendations, and extensive technical details. Both conclude the conversion is successful with similar optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1), Lines 1-150 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing SSIS to Python conversion. They share identical conclusions about conversion success, similar optimization suggestions (parallel processing, memory management, logging enhancements), and comparable cost assessments (0.02 USD). However, Agent_2 provides significantly more granular analysis with detailed component mapping, specific test coverage mentions, and structured business problem identification that Agent_1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1), Lines 1-150 (Agent_2)","Agent_1 uses a simple 6-section structure (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations) while Agent_2 employs a more detailed 7-section numbered approach with subsections and tables. Both follow logical ETL analysis flow but Agent_2 includes additional structural elements like complexity metrics tables, detailed component breakdowns, and comprehensive validation content that Agent_1 omits."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper section headers, coherent paragraphs, and valid technical terminology. Minor issues include less specific technical details and some generalized statements without line-by-line component mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 20-25, 80-90, 140-150","Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent syntax with proper numbered sections, well-formatted tables, detailed technical specifications, and comprehensive component mapping. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points but overall highly structured and technically precise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of Agent_1 (95) and Agent_2 (98). Both outputs maintain high syntactic correctness with Agent_2 showing slightly superior technical precision and structural formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Agent_1 provides solid foundational analysis but could benefit from more detailed component mapping, specific test coverage documentation, and structured technical specifications to match enterprise-grade analysis standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Agent_2 delivers comprehensive analysis meeting enterprise standards. Minor improvements could include more concise executive summary and clearer separation between technical analysis and business recommendations for different stakeholder audiences."
