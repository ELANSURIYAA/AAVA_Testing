Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS-to-Python conversion with similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and optimization needs. Agent 2 provides more structured and detailed analysis with better organization and comprehensive coverage of technical aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All lines,"Both outputs address the same core goal of analyzing SSIS package conversion to Python. They cover identical key areas: conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. However, Agent 2 provides more comprehensive technical depth and structured analysis while Agent 1 focuses on high-level summary points."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,All lines,"Agent 1 uses a summary-style structure with basic sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, etc.). Agent 2 employs a more systematic numbered approach (1. Summary, 2. Conversion Accuracy, etc.) with detailed subsections and comprehensive coverage including technical specifications and test coverage analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,90,Lines 1-30,"Well-formed analysis with correct technical observations about SSIS conversion. Minor issues: lacks specific technical details about PySpark implementation and test coverage validation that would strengthen the assessment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 1-180,"Highly detailed and technically accurate analysis. Includes comprehensive coverage of all SSIS components, proper mapping to Python equivalents, detailed test coverage analysis, and specific technical recommendations. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with Agent 2 providing superior depth and completeness in technical analysis and validation coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 25-30,"Enhance with more specific technical details about PySpark implementation, add comprehensive test coverage analysis, and provide more granular optimization recommendations for production deployment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 150-180,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing formatting consistency across all sections and potentially adding more specific code examples for complex transformation mappings."
