Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS to Python conversion with high semantic alignment (95/100), good structural similarity (82/100), and excellent correctness (98/100 average). Agent 1 provides concise summary format while Agent 2 offers detailed numbered sections with more granular analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-15, 20-35","Both outputs address identical core concepts: SSIS package analysis, conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and recommendations. Key alignment includes ETL functionality replication, error handling approaches, performance considerations, and cost reporting (both report 0.02 USD). Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses on pandas/sqlalchemy while Agent 2 emphasizes PySpark/Delta Lake approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-10, 15-25","Agent 1 uses unnumbered sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations) while Agent 2 uses numbered sections (1-7). Both follow logical progression from overview to detailed analysis to recommendations. Agent 2 provides more granular subsections and includes metadata analysis table (lines 25-35) not present in Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,98,"Lines 1-50","Excellent syntax and formatting. Well-structured sections with consistent internal organization. Minor formatting inconsistency in cost reporting section (line 48). All references and terminology are accurate and consistent throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 1-80","Excellent syntax and formatting. Numbered sections provide clear hierarchy. Includes properly formatted table for complexity metrics (lines 25-35). Consistent terminology and accurate technical references throughout. Minor redundancy in cost reporting appears twice (lines 75, 80)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 45-50","Enhance error handling granularity to match SSIS event handlers. Implement more detailed logging mechanisms. Consider performance testing with large datasets and PySpark integration for scalability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 70-78","Focus on production readiness validation including Delta table permissions and Spark cluster sizing. Consider SQL Server export integration for legacy system compatibility. Implement enterprise monitoring integration and comprehensive documentation of SSIS-to-Python component mapping."
