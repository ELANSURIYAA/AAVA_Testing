Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS to Python conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) and moderate structural differences (72/100). Agent_Summary offers concise executive-style reporting while Agent_Detailed provides systematic numbered sections. Both demonstrate strong technical correctness (Agent_Summary: 92/100, Agent_Detailed: 95/100) with proper syntax and comprehensive coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing SSIS package conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, providing optimization suggestions, and delivering recommendations. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both recognize successful conversion of control flow tasks to Python functions (lines 6-7 in Agent_Summary, lines 15-16 in Agent_Detailed), (2) Both identify data flow component replication using pandas/PySpark operations (lines 8-9 in Agent_Summary, lines 17-18 in Agent_Detailed), (3) Both highlight error handling differences between SSIS event handlers and Python try-except blocks (lines 12-13 in Agent_Summary, lines 25-26 in Agent_Detailed), (4) Both recommend performance optimization through parallel processing (lines 18-19 in Agent_Summary, lines 35-36 in Agent_Detailed). Minor semantic divergence occurs in emphasis: Agent_Summary focuses on business logic preservation while Agent_Detailed emphasizes technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,All Lines,"Structural analysis reveals moderate alignment with key differences in organization approach. Agent_Summary uses executive summary format with sections: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations (lines 1-28). Agent_Detailed employs systematic numbered structure: 1. Summary, 2. Conversion Accuracy, 3. Discrepancies and Issues, 4. Optimization Suggestions, 5. Overall Assessment, 6. Recommendations, 7. API Cost (lines 1-85). Both follow logical ETL analysis flow but differ in presentation style. Agent_Summary provides 6 main sections while Agent_Detailed provides 7 numbered sections with more granular subsections. Control flow mapping is structurally similar in both (lines 6-7 vs lines 15-16), but Agent_Detailed includes additional technical depth with bullet points and detailed component mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Summary,92,Lines 12-13,"Agent_Summary demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with minor issues: (1) Proper section headers and formatting throughout, (2) Accurate technical terminology usage, (3) Consistent reference to SSIS components and Python equivalents, (4) Minor formatting inconsistency in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears twice (lines 12, 27) which seems to be a rendering artifact rather than content error, (5) All technical claims are internally consistent and well-supported, (6) Cost reporting format is consistent (line 28)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Detailed,95,Lines 20-22,"Agent_Detailed exhibits excellent syntactic correctness with minimal issues: (1) Consistent numbered section formatting throughout, (2) Proper bullet point structure and indentation, (3) Accurate technical terminology and component references, (4) Comprehensive coverage with no missing elements, (5) Minor inconsistency in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears in multiple locations (lines 20, 22, 75) suggesting systematic rendering issue, (6) All cross-references and technical details are accurate and complete, (7) Cost reporting is properly formatted (line 85)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor rendering artifacts affecting specific terms. Technical accuracy and internal consistency are excellent in both cases."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Summary,N/A,Lines 22-28,"Enhance structural organization by adopting numbered sections for improved readability and navigation. Consider expanding technical depth in areas like specific component mapping and detailed implementation guidance. Maintain the concise executive summary style while adding more granular technical details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Detailed,N/A,Lines 35-85,"Maintain the excellent systematic structure and comprehensive technical coverage. Consider adding executive summary section at the beginning for stakeholder accessibility. The detailed technical analysis is exemplary and should be preserved. Minor formatting cleanup needed for rendering artifacts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Standardized formatting to eliminate rendering artifacts, (2) Cross-referencing between sections for better navigation, (3) Addition of visual elements like diagrams or flowcharts for complex technical concepts, (4) Consistent terminology glossary, (5) Integration of both executive summary style and detailed technical analysis approaches for comprehensive stakeholder coverage."
