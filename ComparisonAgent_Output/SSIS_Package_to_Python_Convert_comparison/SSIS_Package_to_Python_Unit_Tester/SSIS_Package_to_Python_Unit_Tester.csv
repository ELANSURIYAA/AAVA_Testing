Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"The two agent outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to SSIS-to-Python conversion. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert provides a high-level conversion strategy (1 paragraph), while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester delivers comprehensive test cases and implementation code (300+ lines). Semantic similarity is low (25/100) due to different focus areas - conversion vs testing. Structural similarity is minimal (15/100) as one is narrative text and the other is structured code with test cases. Correctness varies significantly - the conversion output lacks technical depth (60/100) while the testing output demonstrates solid Python/Pytest syntax and structure (95/100), averaging 77.5/100 overall."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,1-300,"Both outputs relate to SSIS-to-Python conversion but address completely different aspects. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert focuses on conversion methodology and acknowledges the need for Python code before testing (lines 1-4). SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester assumes conversion is complete and provides comprehensive testing framework (lines 1-300+). The semantic gap is substantial - one is planning/strategy, the other is implementation/validation. Limited conceptual overlap exists only in the shared domain of SSIS-to-Python transformation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,1-300,"Structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert uses simple narrative prose structure (single paragraph, lines 1-4). SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester employs complex hierarchical structure: test case table (lines 1-25), fixture definitions (lines 30-60), helper functions (lines 65-85), and 12 distinct test functions (lines 90-300+). No common organizational patterns, flow sequences, or decomposition strategies. The outputs represent entirely different document types with no structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,60,1-4,"Syntactically correct prose but lacks technical specificity and actionable detail. The statement is grammatically sound and internally consistent. However, it provides no concrete implementation guidance, specific conversion steps, or technical depth. The acknowledgment of missing Python code is accurate but doesn't advance the conversion process. Content is more of a project status update than a technical solution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,95,1-300,"Demonstrates excellent Python/Pytest syntax and structure. Proper import statements (lines 1-10), well-defined fixtures with correct decorators (lines 30-60), valid PySpark DataFrame operations (lines 90-120), appropriate exception handling with pytest.raises (lines 200-220), and comprehensive test coverage patterns. Minor deduction for some hardcoded values and potential mock setup complexity, but overall shows strong technical competence and testing best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,77.5,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (60 + 95) / 2 = 77.5. Significant variance between outputs reflects different levels of technical depth and implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,N/A,1-4,"Expand output to include specific conversion steps, code examples, and technical implementation details. Current output is too high-level for practical use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,N/A,1-300,"Excellent testing framework. Consider adding integration tests and performance benchmarks. Some test cases could benefit from more edge case scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"These outputs should be combined - use SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert for conversion planning and SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester for validation. Consider creating a unified workflow that includes both conversion methodology and comprehensive testing strategy."
