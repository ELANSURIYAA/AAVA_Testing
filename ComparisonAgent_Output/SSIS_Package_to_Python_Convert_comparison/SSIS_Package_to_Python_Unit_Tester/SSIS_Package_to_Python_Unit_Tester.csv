Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert and SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester outputs reveals significant differences in approach and completeness. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert provides high-level conversion strategy while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester delivers comprehensive test implementation. Semantic similarity is moderate (45/100) as both address Python/SQL testing but from different angles. Structural similarity is low (25/100) due to prose vs. structured code format. Correctness varies significantly with SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert scoring 85/100 for valid prose and SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester scoring 92/100 for well-formed Python code."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,45,1-12,"Both outputs relate to Python SQL testing but address fundamentally different aspects. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert focuses on conversion strategy and mentions unit testing as a future step (line 1). SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester provides actual test implementation with 12 comprehensive test cases covering happy path edge cases and error scenarios (lines 1-12 in test case table). While both understand the need for testing Python SQL code the semantic alignment is partial due to different execution levels."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,25,1-200+,"Structural approaches are fundamentally different. SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert uses unstructured prose format in a single paragraph (line 1). SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester employs highly structured format with numbered test case table (lines 1-12) followed by organized Python code with proper imports fixtures and test functions (lines 13-200+). The structural gap is significant with one being narrative and the other being executable code."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,85,1,"Output is syntactically correct prose with proper grammar and logical flow. However it lacks concrete implementation details and remains at conceptual level. The statement is internally consistent but provides no actionable code or specific test cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,92,13-200+,"Python code demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper imports (lines 13-16) well-structured fixtures (lines 18-45) and comprehensive test functions (lines 47-200+). Minor deductions for some potential issues: mock patching approach could be more robust (lines 150-160) and some test assertions could be more specific (lines 80-90). Overall code follows Pytest best practices and PySpark conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,N/A,"Average correctness score of 88.5 rounded to 89. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats but SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester provides significantly more implementation value."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,N/A,1,"Convert high-level strategy into concrete implementation steps. Provide specific code examples for SSIS to Python conversion. Include actual test case definitions and Pytest structure. Add error handling and logging implementation details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,N/A,150-160,"Enhance mock patching robustness in error test cases. Add more specific assertions for edge cases. Include integration test scenarios. Consider adding performance test cases for large datasets. Improve error message validation in test cases."
