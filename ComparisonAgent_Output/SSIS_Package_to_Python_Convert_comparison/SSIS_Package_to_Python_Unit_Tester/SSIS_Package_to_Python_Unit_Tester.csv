Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Agent 1 provides a brief assessment stating no Python SQL code is available and recommends SSIS package conversion, while Agent 2 delivers comprehensive test cases and Pytest implementation for ETL testing. Semantic similarity is very low (15/100) due to completely different purposes. Structural similarity is minimal (10/100) with entirely different formats. Correctness varies significantly - Agent 1 shows basic correctness (85/100) while Agent 2 demonstrates high technical accuracy (95/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,1-2 vs 1-400+,"Agent 1 focuses on identifying the absence of testable code and recommending conversion approach, while Agent 2 assumes converted code exists and provides comprehensive testing framework. The outputs address completely different stages of the development lifecycle - assessment vs implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,1-2 vs 1-400+,"Agent 1 uses simple prose format in curly braces, while Agent 2 employs structured markdown with tables, code blocks, and systematic organization. No structural overlap exists between a brief assessment and detailed technical implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,1-2,"Minor issues: Uses double curly braces unnecessarily, could be more specific about next steps. Content is logically sound but presentation could be cleaner."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,1-400+,"Highly accurate Python/Pytest code with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor deduction for some test cases that could have more robust assertions and error handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,,"Provide more specific guidance on conversion approach, include timeline estimates, and suggest intermediate deliverables for better project planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,,"Add more comprehensive error handling in test cases, include performance testing scenarios, and consider adding integration tests alongside unit tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"These outputs serve different project phases and should be sequenced appropriately - use Agent 1's assessment to guide conversion, then apply Agent 2's testing framework to the converted code."
