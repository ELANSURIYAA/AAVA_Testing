Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between SSIS_Converter and Unit_Tester outputs reveals fundamentally different approaches to the same task domain. SSIS_Converter provides a brief acknowledgment of missing prerequisites with conversion guidance, while Unit_Tester delivers comprehensive test case documentation and implementation. The outputs address different phases of the development lifecycle - conversion planning versus testing implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-2 vs Lines 1-150","Both outputs relate to SSIS-to-Python conversion context but serve completely different purposes. SSIS_Converter focuses on prerequisite analysis and conversion planning, while Unit_Tester provides comprehensive testing framework for post-conversion validation. Semantic alignment is minimal as they address different workflow stages."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-2 vs Lines 1-150","Structural approaches are fundamentally different. SSIS_Converter uses narrative explanation format, while Unit_Tester employs structured documentation with tabular test cases and executable code blocks. No shared organizational patterns or logical flow alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Converter,95,"Lines 1-2","Syntactically correct prose with proper grammar and logical flow. Minor deduction for lack of structured formatting that would enhance readability and actionability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Unit_Tester,92,"Lines 15-150","Well-structured Python code with proper syntax, imports, and pytest conventions. Minor issues include potential import path assumptions and some test cases that could benefit from more robust error simulation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"N/A","Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 92) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94"

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Converter,N/A,"Lines 1-2","Enhance output with structured action items, timeline estimates, and specific technical requirements for SSIS-to-Python conversion. Consider providing preliminary code structure or conversion templates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Unit_Tester,N/A,"Lines 1-150","Strengthen error simulation in test cases TC08-TC10 with more realistic failure scenarios. Add integration tests for end-to-end ETL pipeline validation. Consider parameterizing test data for broader coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"N/A","These outputs appear to address different phases of the same project. Consider integrating them into a cohesive workflow where SSIS_Converter output informs the conversion process, followed by Unit_Tester validation framework application."
