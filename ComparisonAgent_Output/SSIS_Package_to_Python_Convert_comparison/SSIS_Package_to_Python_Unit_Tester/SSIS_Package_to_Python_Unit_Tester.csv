Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-2 vs Lines 1-300+","Agent 1 provides a brief acknowledgment that no Python SQL code exists and recommends converting SSIS to Python first. Agent 2 delivers comprehensive test cases and Pytest implementation assuming the conversion is complete. Fundamental mismatch in approach and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-2 vs Lines 1-50","Both agents address testing Python SQL code, but Agent 1 identifies a prerequisite (SSIS conversion) while Agent 2 assumes completion and provides full test implementation. Partial intent overlap but different task understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-2 vs Lines 1-300+","Agent 1 uses simple narrative structure (2 lines). Agent 2 uses structured test documentation with tables, code blocks, fixtures, and systematic test organization. Fundamentally different structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 1-2","Syntactically correct prose with proper grammar and logical flow. Minor deduction for brevity without detailed justification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,"Lines 51-300+","Python code is syntactically valid with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor issues: some mock patches may need adjustment (lines 180-190), and DataFrame creation with invalid data types should use proper error handling (line 220)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 92) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-2","Expand analysis to include specific conversion requirements, timeline, and dependencies for SSIS-to-Python conversion before test development."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 180-220","Enhance error handling in mock scenarios, add integration test cases for Delta Lake operations, and include performance benchmarks for ETL pipeline validation."
