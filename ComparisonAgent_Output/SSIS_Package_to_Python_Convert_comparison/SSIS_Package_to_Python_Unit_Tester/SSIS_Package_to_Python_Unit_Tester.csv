Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,N/A,"Two fundamentally different outputs: SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert provides a brief status explanation (1 paragraph), while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester delivers comprehensive test cases and Pytest implementation (400+ lines). Semantic similarity is low (25/100) due to different purposes, structural similarity is minimal (15/100) due to vastly different formats, and correctness varies significantly between agents (95/100 vs 88/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,1-400,"SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert addresses the absence of Python SQL code and suggests conversion approach, while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester assumes converted code exists and provides comprehensive testing framework. Both relate to SSIS-to-Python conversion but serve different phases of the process."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,1-400,"Completely different structures: SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert uses narrative prose format, while SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester uses structured markdown with tables, code blocks, and systematic test organization. No common structural elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,95,1,"Well-formed prose with clear logical flow. Minor deduction for double braces formatting inconsistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,88,Multiple,"Generally well-structured with valid Python syntax and comprehensive test coverage. Issues include: inconsistent import organization (lines 10-15), potential schema mismatch in aggregation functions (lines 45-50), missing error handling in some test cases (lines 200-250), and incomplete mocking patterns (lines 300-350)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 88) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,,N/A,"Consider providing more detailed conversion roadmap with specific technical steps and timeline estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,,Multiple,"Improve import organization, add comprehensive error handling patterns, ensure schema consistency in test data, and implement more robust mocking strategies for external dependencies."
