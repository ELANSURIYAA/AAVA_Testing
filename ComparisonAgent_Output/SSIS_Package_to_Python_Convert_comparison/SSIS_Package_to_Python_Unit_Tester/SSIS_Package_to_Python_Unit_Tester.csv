Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 provides a brief acknowledgment that no Python SQL code exists for unit testing and suggests converting SSIS package first. Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive unit testing solution with 12 detailed test cases and complete Pytest implementation. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - Agent 1 identifies a prerequisite gap while Agent 2 assumes the conversion is complete and provides full testing framework. Semantic similarity is very low (15/100) due to different task interpretations. Structural similarity is minimal (10/100) as one is a brief statement while the other is a structured testing framework. Correctness varies significantly - Agent 1 has perfect syntax (100/100) for its brief response, while Agent 2 has minor syntax issues (85/100) in the Pytest code, averaging 92.5/100 overall."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200","Agent 1 interprets the task as identifying a missing prerequisite (Python SQL code conversion), while Agent 2 assumes the conversion is complete and provides comprehensive unit testing. Agent 1 focuses on the conversion workflow gap, while Agent 2 delivers actual test cases for ETL processes including employee data transformations, salary thresholds, error handling, and logging scenarios. The semantic intent diverges significantly - one identifies blockers, the other provides solutions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200","Agent 1 uses a single paragraph narrative structure explaining the situation and next steps. Agent 2 employs a structured approach with: (1) Test Case List table with 12 entries covering ID, Description, Expected Outcome; (2) Complete Pytest script with fixtures, helper functions, and individual test methods. The structural approaches are fundamentally different - brief explanation versus comprehensive testing framework with multiple components and sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,Line 1,"Agent 1's single paragraph response has perfect syntax, grammar, and internal consistency. No syntax errors, undefined references, or structural issues present."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,85,"Lines 45, 67, 89, 156, 178","Agent 2's Pytest script has several syntax issues: (1) Line 45 - Missing import for date function used in test data; (2) Line 67 - Inconsistent DataFrame creation pattern; (3) Line 89 - Potential issues with mock patching scope; (4) Line 156 - String literal in numeric field may cause type errors; (5) Line 178 - Mock patching may not work as expected with PySpark DataFrameWriter. Overall structure is sound but contains implementable syntax concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average of Agent 1 (100) and Agent 2 (85) correctness scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Agent 1 should expand beyond problem identification to provide actionable conversion steps or at minimum outline the testing approach that would be implemented post-conversion."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Agent 2 should fix syntax issues: add proper imports (datetime.date), resolve mock patching scope issues, ensure type consistency in test data, and validate PySpark-specific mocking approaches. Consider adding integration test scenarios and Delta Lake specific test cases."
