Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert provided a brief acknowledgment that no Python SQL code was available for unit test design, suggesting conversion of SSIS package first. Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester delivered a comprehensive solution with 12 detailed test cases and complete Pytest implementation covering happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - one identifying prerequisites, the other providing a complete testing framework."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,1-1 vs 1-400,"Both agents understood the task involves unit testing for Python SQL code, but Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert focused on prerequisite identification while Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester assumed code availability and provided complete test implementation. Semantic alignment is low due to different interpretations of task scope and deliverable expectations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,1-1 vs 1-400,"Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert produced a single paragraph explanation. Agent SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester delivered structured output with test case table (lines 1-15), comprehensive Pytest scripts with fixtures (lines 20-50), test functions (lines 60-380), and proper organization. Structural approaches are fundamentally different with no meaningful overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,95,1,"Single paragraph is syntactically correct with proper grammar and logical flow. Minor deduction for not providing actionable deliverable as typically expected in testing contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,88,Multiple lines,"Pytest code is largely syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Issues include: missing import for run_etl function (line 60), potential issues with mocking approach (lines 200-220), and some test assertions could be more robust (lines 150-180). Overall well-structured but has implementation gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents: (95 + 88) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert,N/A,1,"Should provide actionable next steps or preliminary test framework even when prerequisites are missing. Consider offering template test structure or conversion guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester,N/A,60-380,"Excellent comprehensive approach but needs refinement: 1) Add proper imports for custom functions, 2) Improve mocking strategies for external dependencies, 3) Add more robust assertions for edge cases, 4) Include setup/teardown for test isolation, 5) Add integration test examples alongside unit tests."
