Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were provided as placeholders ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) rather than actual content. This comparison framework demonstrates the required methodology and structure for SSIS Package to Python conversion unit testing comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze: intent alignment in SSIS to Python conversion approach, unit testing strategy consistency, and overall goal achievement."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze: code organization patterns, test structure hierarchy, conversion workflow steps, and component decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholders for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure SSIS to Python conversion outputs include complete code transformation logic. 3. Verify unit test outputs cover edge cases and error handling. 4. Include documentation for conversion methodology and test coverage rationale."
