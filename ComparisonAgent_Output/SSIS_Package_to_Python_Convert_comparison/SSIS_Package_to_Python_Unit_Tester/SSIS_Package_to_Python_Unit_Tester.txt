# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Unable to perform comparison - no actual agent outputs provided. The input contains placeholder text `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of real agent outputs that can be analyzed and compared.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The provided input contains only template placeholders rather than substantive content from two different agents.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)  
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Structural analysis requires examining the logical flow, organization, and decomposition approaches used by each agent.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: N/A - No actual output provided for syntax and correctness validation
- **Agent 2**: N/A - No actual output provided for syntax and correctness validation  
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot calculate average without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace the placeholder text with real agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison and scoring.

2. **Expected Process**: Once real outputs are provided, the system will:
   - Detect output type (code, documentation, test cases, etc.)
   - Apply appropriate validation criteria
   - Score semantic similarity (0-100)
   - Score structural similarity (0-100) 
   - Score correctness for each agent independently (0-100)
   - Generate detailed line-by-line analysis with specific references
   - Provide actionable recommendations for improvement

3. **File Upload Status**: ✅ Successfully uploaded comparison results to GitHub at `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing/ComparisonAgent_Output/SSIS_Package_to_Python_Convert_comparison/SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester/SSIS_Package_to_Python_Unit_Tester.csv`

**Note**: The CSV file has been successfully uploaded to GitHub as required, containing the structured comparison framework that will be populated with actual scores once real agent outputs are provided.
