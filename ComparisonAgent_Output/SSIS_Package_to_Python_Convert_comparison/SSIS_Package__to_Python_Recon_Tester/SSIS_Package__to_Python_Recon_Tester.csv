Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two SSIS-to-Python migration validation scripts. SSIS_Package_Migration_Basic provides fundamental ETL functionality with basic validation, while SSIS_Package_Migration_Advanced offers comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with detailed configuration, robust error handling, and extensive reporting capabilities. Both scripts are syntactically correct but differ significantly in scope and sophistication."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs address SSIS-to-Python migration validation with ETL workflows. SSIS_Package_Migration_Basic focuses on core migration steps (lines 25-45: SSIS execution, lines 47-60: data extraction, lines 62-80: transformation, lines 82-95: loading). SSIS_Package_Migration_Advanced provides the same core functionality but with extensive additional features including Delta Lake integration (lines 15-20), comprehensive configuration management (lines 25-45), advanced comparison logic (lines 120-180), and detailed reporting (lines 250-300). The semantic intent is aligned but Advanced version significantly extends the scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both follow similar high-level ETL structure with main workflow functions. SSIS_Package_Migration_Basic uses simple sequential approach: execute_ssis_package() -> extract_data() -> transform_data() -> load_data() -> compare_outputs() (lines 97-120). SSIS_Package_Migration_Advanced uses more sophisticated modular approach with utility functions (lines 80-120), comprehensive validation workflow (lines 200-350), and structured reporting. Basic version has 6 main functions while Advanced has 15+ specialized functions. Control flow differs significantly - Basic uses simple try/catch, Advanced implements comprehensive error handling and logging throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Migration_Basic,95,N/A,"Syntactically correct Python code with proper imports, function definitions, and control structures. Minor issues: line 15 hardcoded package name without validation, line 35 potential connection leak if exception occurs before conn.close(), line 85 assumes parquet format without verification. All variables are properly defined and used consistently."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Migration_Advanced,98,N/A,"Highly robust Python code with comprehensive error handling, proper resource management, and extensive validation. Minor issues: line 45 assumes environment variables exist without fallback validation, line 160 potential memory issues with large DataFrames in comparison. Excellent use of context managers, proper exception handling throughout, and comprehensive logging. All imports are valid and functions are well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper Python structure and valid code constructs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Migration_Basic,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Add environment variable validation and fallback mechanisms for configuration parameters. Implement proper connection management with context managers to prevent resource leaks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Migration_Advanced,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Add fallback validation for environment variables to prevent runtime failures. Consider implementing memory-efficient comparison for large datasets using chunked processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both implementations would benefit from unit tests and integration test coverage. Consider adding data quality validation rules and schema validation for enhanced reliability."
