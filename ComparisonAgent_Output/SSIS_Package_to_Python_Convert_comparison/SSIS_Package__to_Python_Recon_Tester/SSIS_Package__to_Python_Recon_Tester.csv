Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two Python scripts for SSIS-to-Python migration validation. Agent_1 provides a basic migration script with core ETL functionality, while Agent_2 delivers a comprehensive enterprise-grade validation framework with advanced features like Delta Lake integration, detailed comparison algorithms, and extensive error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","Both outputs address SSIS-to-Python migration validation but with different scopes. Agent_1 focuses on basic ETL operations (extract, transform, load) with simple validation, while Agent_2 provides comprehensive validation including Delta Lake integration, detailed DataFrame comparison, log analysis, and error handling. Core intent aligns but implementation depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-300","Agent_1 follows a simple linear structure with basic functions for ETL operations. Agent_2 uses a modular architecture with configuration sections, utility functions, and comprehensive workflow orchestration. Both use similar import patterns and main() function structure, but Agent_2 has significantly more sophisticated organization with clear separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 15, 35, 45","Minor syntax issues: Missing error handling in some database connections (line 35), potential issues with environment variable handling (line 15), and incomplete exception handling in transform_data function (line 45). Overall structure is syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 80, 120","Very robust implementation with comprehensive error handling. Minor potential issues with file path handling in Windows environments (line 80) and assumption about Delta table existence (line 120). Excellent syntax and structure overall."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with Agent_2 showing superior error handling and robustness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 20-30, 40-50","Enhance error handling mechanisms, add comprehensive logging, implement data validation checks, and include configuration management for better maintainability and production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 100-150","Consider adding unit tests, implement retry mechanisms for external dependencies, add performance monitoring, and include data quality validation rules for enterprise deployment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent_2 provides a more production-ready solution with comprehensive validation capabilities. Agent_1 serves as a good foundation but requires significant enhancement for enterprise use. Consider adopting Agent_2's modular approach and comprehensive error handling patterns."
