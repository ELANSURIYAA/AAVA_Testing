Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both scripts implement SSIS-to-Python ETL migration validation but with significantly different approaches. migration_validation provides a basic workflow with fundamental ETL operations, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation offers an enterprise-grade solution with comprehensive validation, detailed reporting, and robust error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150 (migration_validation) vs Lines 1-300 (Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation)","Both scripts share the core intent of validating SSIS-to-Python ETL migrations. However, migration_validation focuses on basic ETL operations (extract, transform, load) with simple output comparison, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation provides comprehensive validation including control flow verification, error log analysis, and detailed reporting. The semantic alignment is strong in core purpose but diverges in implementation depth and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 15-45 vs Lines 50-100, Lines 80-120 vs Lines 200-250","Both scripts follow ETL workflow patterns but with different structural approaches. migration_validation uses a linear main() function with sequential steps, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation employs modular architecture with extensive configuration, utility functions, and structured reporting. The flow differs significantly: migration_validation has simple extract->transform->load->compare, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation has comprehensive setup->execute->extract->compare->report workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,migration_validation,78,"Lines 25-30, 85-90, 140-145","Script has mostly correct Python syntax with proper imports and function definitions. Issues identified: Line 85 uses undefined 'ssis_output_path' and 'python_output_path' variables in compare_outputs function call without prior definition. Line 140 references parquet files that aren't created in the workflow. Error handling is present but basic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation,92,"Lines 150-160, 280-290","Script demonstrates excellent Python syntax with comprehensive imports, proper exception handling, and well-structured code. Minor issues: Line 150 has potential issue with Delta table path assumptions. Line 280 could have more robust error handling for Spark session cleanup. Overall syntax is highly professional with proper type hints and documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,,"Average correctness score across both implementations. migration_validation has fundamental syntax correctness but implementation gaps, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation shows enterprise-grade code quality with minimal syntax issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,migration_validation,,"Enhance error handling robustness, fix undefined variable references in compare_outputs function (lines 140-145), implement proper file path validation, add comprehensive logging configuration, and include data type handling in transformation functions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation,,"Consider adding input validation for environment variables, implement retry mechanisms for external system calls, add more granular error categorization, and include performance monitoring capabilities for large dataset processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both implementations would benefit from standardized configuration management, unified error handling patterns, and consistent logging formats. Consider adopting the modular architecture approach from Employee_Data_Warehouse_Migration_Validation while incorporating the simpler workflow clarity from migration_validation."
