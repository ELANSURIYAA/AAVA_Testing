Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs address SSIS to Python migration validation but with significantly different approaches and complexity levels. The first script provides basic migration validation functionality, while the second script offers a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with advanced features like Delta Lake integration, Spark processing, and detailed reporting capabilities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150 (Script 1), Lines 1-350 (Script 2)","Both scripts share the core semantic goal of validating SSIS to Python ETL migration. However, Script 2 provides significantly more comprehensive functionality including Delta Lake integration, Spark session management, advanced error handling, and detailed JSON reporting. Script 1 focuses on basic validation with pandas and SQL Server connectivity. The semantic alignment is strong for core functionality but diverges in implementation sophistication."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 15-45 (Script 1), Lines 80-120 (Script 2)","Both scripts follow similar high-level structural patterns with function-based decomposition for extract, transform, load, and compare operations. However, Script 2 has a more sophisticated architecture with better separation of concerns, configuration management, and modular design. Script 1 uses a simpler linear approach while Script 2 implements enterprise patterns with comprehensive logging and error handling throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script 1,85,"Lines 10-12, 25-30, 65-70","Script 1 has generally correct Python syntax with proper imports and function definitions. Minor issues include potential undefined variable references in error scenarios and missing null checks in data operations. The subprocess call for SSIS execution is properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script 2,92,"Lines 45-50, 180-185, 280-290","Script 2 demonstrates excellent Python syntax with comprehensive error handling, proper exception management, and robust type hints. Very minor issues with potential file path handling edge cases and some complex nested operations that could benefit from additional validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both scripts demonstrate good Python syntax with Script 2 showing superior error handling and code quality practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Script 1,,"Consider implementing more comprehensive error handling, adding configuration management through environment variables, and incorporating more sophisticated data comparison logic with detailed reporting capabilities."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Script 2,,"Excellent comprehensive implementation. Minor recommendations include adding more inline documentation for complex Delta Lake operations and considering additional edge case handling for large dataset processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both scripts would benefit from unit test coverage and integration with CI/CD pipelines. Consider standardizing logging formats and adding performance monitoring capabilities for production deployment."
