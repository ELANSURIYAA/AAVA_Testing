Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} appear to be empty or unfilled. This prevents systematic comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Both agent output placeholders are empty, preventing assessment of intent alignment, reasoning similarity, or outcome coherence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Unable to compare logical flow, decomposition approach, or organizational patterns between agents."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness for SSIS Package agent output as content was not provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Python_Convert_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness for Python Convert agent output as content was not provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent output evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison analysis. 2. Ensure input placeholders are properly filled with agent-generated content. 3. Verify that both agents have completed their respective tasks before initiating comparison. 4. Re-run comparison once valid agent outputs are available."
