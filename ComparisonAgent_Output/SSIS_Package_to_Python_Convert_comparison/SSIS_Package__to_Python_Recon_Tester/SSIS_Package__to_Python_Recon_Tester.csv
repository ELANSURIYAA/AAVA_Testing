Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two distinct Python scripts addressing SSIS-to-Python migration: Basic_Migration_Script provides fundamental ETL operations with logging and error handling, while Comprehensive_Validation_Script offers extensive validation framework comparing SSIS and Python outputs. Scripts serve complementary but different purposes in migration workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,Lines 1-100 vs 1-200,"Scripts address related but fundamentally different aspects of SSIS migration. Basic_Migration_Script focuses on core ETL execution (extract, transform, load), while Comprehensive_Validation_Script emphasizes validation and comparison between SSIS and Python outputs. Both involve SSIS packages but serve different workflow stages."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,35,Lines 1-100 vs 1-200,"Both scripts follow modular function-based architecture with logging setup and main workflow. However, Basic_Migration_Script uses simple sequential ETL pattern, while Comprehensive_Validation_Script employs complex validation framework with Spark integration, subprocess management, and comprehensive reporting structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Basic_Migration_Script,85,Lines 15-20 and 65-70,"Script has solid syntax and structure. Minor issues: hardcoded package path 'Employee_Data_Warehouse.dtsx' (line 67), potential connection string exposure in logging, and missing validation of environment variables before use."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Validation_Script,90,Lines 25-30 and 180-190,"Well-structured script with comprehensive error handling. Minor issues: potential race condition in subprocess handling (lines 85-90), and some hardcoded assumptions about column names for sorting (lines 140-145)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,N/A,"Both scripts demonstrate good Python practices with proper error handling, logging, and modular design. Average correctness score reflects solid implementation with minor improvement opportunities."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Basic_Migration_Script,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Implement environment variable validation before use, externalize hardcoded paths, add data quality checks during transformation phase, and enhance security by avoiding credential exposure in logs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Validation_Script,N/A,Lines 85-90 and 140-145,"Add timeout handling for subprocess operations, make column name assumptions configurable, implement retry logic for Delta table operations, and add more granular error categorization in validation reports."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Scripts serve complementary purposes in SSIS migration workflow. Basic_Migration_Script should be enhanced with validation capabilities, while Comprehensive_Validation_Script could benefit from integration with the ETL execution phase for end-to-end automation."
