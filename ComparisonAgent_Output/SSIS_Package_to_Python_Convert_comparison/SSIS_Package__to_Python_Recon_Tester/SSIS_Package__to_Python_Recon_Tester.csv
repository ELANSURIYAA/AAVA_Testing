Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide Python scripts for SSIS-to-Python ETL migration validation. SSIS_Package_Basic offers a straightforward approach with core functionality including SSIS execution, data extraction, transformation, loading, and basic output comparison. SSIS_Package_Advanced provides a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with Spark/Delta Lake integration, advanced error handling, detailed logging, and extensive validation capabilities. While both achieve the core objective, SSIS_Package_Advanced demonstrates superior architecture, robustness, and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both scripts address SSIS-to-Python migration validation with shared core objectives: executing SSIS packages, extracting and transforming data, loading to destinations, and comparing outputs. However, SSIS_Package_Advanced extends beyond basic validation to include Delta Lake integration (lines 85-90), comprehensive error log analysis (lines 180-195), and detailed reporting mechanisms (lines 280-320). The semantic intent aligns at 78% due to shared migration validation goals, but SSIS_Package_Advanced addresses enterprise-scale requirements that SSIS_Package_Basic does not cover."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"SSIS_Package_Basic follows a linear main() workflow (lines 85-105) with individual functions for each ETL step. SSIS_Package_Advanced implements a sophisticated modular architecture with utility functions (lines 60-120), configuration management (lines 20-40), and comprehensive validation workflows (lines 250-350). Both use similar function decomposition for core operations but differ significantly in error handling patterns, logging strategies, and output processing approaches. The structural similarity is 65% due to shared functional decomposition but different architectural complexity levels."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Basic,92,N/A,"SSIS_Package_Basic demonstrates solid Python syntax with proper imports (lines 1-8), valid function definitions (lines 15-80), and correct pandas/sqlalchemy usage (lines 45-65). Minor issues include potential undefined variable references in environment handling (line 12) and basic error handling that could be more robust. The script is syntactically correct and would execute successfully in a properly configured environment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Advanced,96,N/A,"SSIS_Package_Advanced shows excellent Python syntax with comprehensive imports (lines 1-15), proper type annotations (lines 45-50), and robust error handling throughout (lines 100-200). The script demonstrates advanced Python patterns including context managers, proper exception handling, and secure credential management. Minor syntax considerations include complex nested dictionary operations (lines 180-200) that could benefit from additional validation, but overall correctness is very high."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 94 reflects both scripts' strong syntactic validity and internal consistency. Both demonstrate proper Python structure, valid library usage, and executable code patterns. SSIS_Package_Advanced edges ahead with more sophisticated error handling and type safety measures."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Basic,N/A,Lines 15-25,"Consider implementing more comprehensive error handling patterns similar to SSIS_Package_Advanced. Add configuration management for better maintainability and enhance logging capabilities for production deployment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Advanced,N/A,Lines 180-200,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding input validation for complex nested operations and potentially simplifying some of the more complex dictionary manipulations for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts successfully address SSIS-to-Python migration validation. SSIS_Package_Basic provides a solid foundation suitable for simple migration scenarios, while SSIS_Package_Advanced offers enterprise-grade capabilities for complex production environments. Choose based on specific requirements: basic validation needs vs. comprehensive enterprise deployment."
