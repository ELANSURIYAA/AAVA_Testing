Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide Python scripts for SSIS-to-Python ETL migration validation. Agent 1 offers a basic implementation with core functionality including SSIS execution, data extraction/transformation/loading, and output comparison. Agent 2 provides an enterprise-grade solution with advanced features like Spark/Delta Lake integration, comprehensive error handling, detailed reporting, and production-ready architecture. While both address the same core objective, Agent 2 demonstrates significantly more sophisticated implementation with better scalability and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both scripts address SSIS-to-Python migration validation with shared core concepts: executing SSIS packages, extracting/transforming/loading data, and comparing outputs. However, Agent 2 extends beyond basic validation to include comprehensive reporting, advanced data processing with Spark/Delta Lake, and enterprise-grade error handling. Agent 1 focuses on simple pandas-based operations while Agent 2 implements big data processing patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,N/A,"Both scripts follow ETL workflow patterns but with different architectural approaches. Agent 1 uses a linear main() function with basic error handling (lines 1-95). Agent 2 implements a modular architecture with utility functions, configuration management, and comprehensive logging (lines 1-250+). Agent 1 has 6 main functions while Agent 2 has 10+ specialized functions with clear separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 15-16, 32, 58","Agent 1 has solid Python syntax but some issues: missing import for sqlalchemy.create_engine usage (line 58), hardcoded file paths without validation (line 32), and potential connection leaks in extract_data function (lines 32-42). The subprocess call to DTExec may fail on non-Windows systems."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 45-50, 180-185","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent syntax and structure with comprehensive error handling. Minor issues include potential race conditions in file operations (lines 180-185) and assumptions about Delta table structure without schema validation (lines 45-50). Overall very robust implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both scripts being syntactically sound with Agent 2 showing superior error handling and production readiness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 1-95","Agent 1 should add: comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, environment variable validation, connection pooling for database operations, configurable logging levels, and cross-platform compatibility for SSIS execution. Consider adding data validation and schema checking before comparisons."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 1-250+","Agent 2 is production-ready but could benefit from: adding schema validation for Delta tables, implementing retry mechanisms for Spark operations, adding data quality checks beyond row counts, and including performance metrics in the validation report. Consider adding unit tests for utility functions."
