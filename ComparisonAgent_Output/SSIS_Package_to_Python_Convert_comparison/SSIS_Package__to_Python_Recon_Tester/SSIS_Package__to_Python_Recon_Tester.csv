Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide Python scripts for SSIS-to-Python migration validation. Agent 1 offers a basic implementation with core ETL functionality, while Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with advanced features like Delta Lake integration, detailed logging, and extensive error handling. The scripts share similar high-level goals but differ significantly in implementation depth and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both scripts address SSIS-to-Python migration validation with similar core objectives: executing SSIS packages, extracting data, transforming data, loading data, and comparing outputs. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more comprehensive functionality including Delta Lake integration, advanced error handling, detailed reporting, and production-ready features. Agent 1 focuses on basic ETL operations while Agent 2 implements enterprise-grade validation with extensive configuration options and robust comparison mechanisms."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,N/A,"The scripts follow different structural approaches. Agent 1 uses a simple linear workflow with basic functions (lines 15-85), while Agent 2 implements a modular architecture with extensive configuration (lines 1-50), utility functions (lines 70-120), and comprehensive workflow orchestration (lines 150-300). Agent 1 has 6 main functions in ~100 lines, while Agent 2 has 15+ functions in ~300 lines with clear separation of concerns and enterprise patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,"Lines 20, 35, 45","Agent 1 has minor syntax issues: missing import for datetime.datetime (line 45), potential connection string security concerns (line 20), and basic error handling that could be improved. The script is functionally correct but lacks production-ready robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 25, 180","Agent 2 has excellent syntax and structure with comprehensive error handling, proper imports, and secure credential management. Minor issues include potential path handling edge cases (line 25) and complex nested try-catch blocks (line 180) that could be simplified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both scripts being syntactically sound with Agent 2 demonstrating superior production readiness and comprehensive error handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,"Lines 1-100","Agent 1 should enhance error handling, add comprehensive logging, implement secure credential management, and expand validation capabilities to match enterprise requirements. Consider adding Delta Lake support and detailed reporting mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,"Lines 1-300","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent enterprise practices and should be considered the preferred approach. Minor improvements could include simplifying complex nested error handling and adding more inline documentation for maintenance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"For production deployment, Agent 2's comprehensive approach with Delta Lake integration, extensive error handling, and detailed reporting provides superior validation capabilities. Agent 1 could serve as a starting point but requires significant enhancement for enterprise use."
