Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison analysis limited: Only one agent output (marketing_healthcare_extract.py Python script) provided for evaluation. Agent 2 output missing. Unable to perform comparative analysis across semantic similarity and structural similarity dimensions. Individual correctness assessment performed for available output."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - Agent 2 output not provided. Semantic comparison requires both outputs to assess intent alignment, reasoning similarity, and outcome coherence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - Agent 2 output not provided. Structural comparison requires both outputs to assess logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,marketing_healthcare_extract.py,85,"Lines 15-17 and 42-43","Python syntax is valid with proper imports and function definitions. Minor issues: (1) Line 15-17 - Hardcoded default values in environment variable calls may cause runtime issues if not properly configured. (2) Line 42-43 - SQLAlchemy URI construction could benefit from URL encoding for special characters in passwords. (3) Missing error handling for database connections and SQL execution failures."

Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,N/A,"Overall correctness score based on single available output. Score reflects solid Python implementation with minor configuration and error handling improvements needed."
