Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison cannot be completed as only one agent output was provided. The single output is a Python script (marketing_healthcare_extract.py) that converts SAS logic to Python for healthcare marketing data extraction. The script includes proper structure, documentation, error handling, and follows Python best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as only one agent output (DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G) was provided. Comparison requires two outputs to assess meaning and intent alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity as only one agent output (DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G) was provided. Comparison requires two outputs to assess logical structure and flow alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G,95,"Lines 1-150","Python script demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, function definitions, SQL query structure, and main execution flow. Minor deduction for potential runtime dependency issues (teradatasqlalchemy package availability) and hardcoded fallback values that may not work in all environments."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"No second agent output provided for correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score as only one agent output was provided."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G,N/A,"Lines 20-25, 45-50","Add input validation for environment variables and database connection parameters. Consider adding logging for better debugging and monitoring. Include error handling for database connection failures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To complete this comparison, please provide the second agent output. The comparison framework is ready to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness once both outputs are available."
