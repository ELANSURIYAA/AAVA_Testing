Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Only one agent output provided (DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G). Cannot perform meaningful comparison between two agents as required. The provided output is a well-structured Python script for healthcare marketing data extraction with proper documentation, error handling, and modular design."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to assess meaning and intent alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to assess logical structure and flow differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_Python_Converter_PY_G,95,Lines 15-16,"Python script is syntactically correct with proper imports, function definitions, and SQL query structure. Minor deduction for potential runtime dependency issues (teradatasqlalchemy package availability) and hardcoded connection string format that may need adjustment for specific Teradata configurations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Overall correctness based on single agent analysis. Script demonstrates good Python practices with proper error handling structure and modular design."
