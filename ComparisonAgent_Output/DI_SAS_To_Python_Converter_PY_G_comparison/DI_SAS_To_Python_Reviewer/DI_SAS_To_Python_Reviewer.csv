Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between Python code output and SAS macro analysis output reveals fundamentally different output types and purposes. Python_Output contains executable code while SAS_Analysis_Output provides analytical commentary about macro conversion status. This represents a type mismatch rather than comparable outputs addressing the same task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,All lines,"The outputs address completely different aspects of the same underlying task. Python_Output appears to be converted code while SAS_Analysis_Output is meta-analysis about the conversion process. Semantic alignment is minimal as one is executable code and the other is analytical commentary."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,All lines,"Structural similarity is extremely low due to fundamental type differences. Python_Output follows code structure (imports, functions, logic blocks) while SAS_Analysis_Output follows analytical report structure (findings, remarks, recommendations). No comparable structural elements exist."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Python_Output,85,N/A,"Python code appears syntactically valid based on visible structure references, though complete validation requires full code visibility. Assuming standard Python syntax compliance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SAS_Analysis_Output,95,Lines 1-8,"Analysis output is well-structured with clear findings, proper formatting, and logical conclusions. Minor deduction for brevity that could benefit from more detailed recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score reflects both outputs being internally consistent and well-formed within their respective domains."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"These outputs serve different purposes in the conversion workflow and should not be directly compared. Python_Output should be evaluated against conversion accuracy criteria while SAS_Analysis_Output should be assessed for analytical completeness and actionable insights."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Python_Output,N/A,N/A,"Validate code execution, test functionality, and verify business logic conversion accuracy against original SAS requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SAS_Analysis_Output,N/A,N/A,"Expand analysis to include specific recommendations for code review, testing strategies, and validation approaches for the converted Python code."
