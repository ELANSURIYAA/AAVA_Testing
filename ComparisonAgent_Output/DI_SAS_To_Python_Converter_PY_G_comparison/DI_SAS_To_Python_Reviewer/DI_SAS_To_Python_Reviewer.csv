Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1 vs 1-8","Comparison between a simple file path reference (input.sas) and a comprehensive macro analysis report (DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer). The outputs serve fundamentally different purposes - one provides a file location while the other delivers structured analytical findings about SAS macro conversion status."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-8","Extremely low semantic similarity. input.sas provides only a file path reference while DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer delivers comprehensive analysis of macro conversion status. The outputs address completely different aspects of the workflow - file location vs analytical findings."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-8","Minimal structural similarity. input.sas uses simple string format while DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer employs structured report format with distinct sections (findings, missing/unconverted, remarks, recommendations). Completely different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,input.sas,100,"Line 1","Valid file path format with proper directory structure and .sas extension. No syntax errors or formatting issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer,95,"Lines 2-3","Well-structured analysis report with clear sections and logical flow. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point structure but overall excellent correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,input.sas,,"Line 1","Consider providing more context or metadata along with file path references to improve semantic value and integration with downstream processes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer,,"Lines 2-3","Maintain consistent bullet point formatting throughout the report. Consider adding timestamp or version information for better traceability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1 vs 1-8","These outputs appear to serve different purposes in the workflow. Ensure proper integration where file references connect to their corresponding analysis reports for complete traceability."
