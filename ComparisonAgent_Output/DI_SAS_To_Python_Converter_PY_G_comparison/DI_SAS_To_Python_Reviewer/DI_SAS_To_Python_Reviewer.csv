Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between SAS-to-Python conversion output and macro analysis review. Agent 1 represents a converted Python file while Agent 2 provides analysis of macro conversion completeness. Limited comparison possible due to incomplete Agent 1 content visibility."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,N/A,"Low semantic similarity. Agent 1 appears to be executable Python code converted from SAS, while Agent 2 is analytical text reviewing macro conversion status. Both relate to SAS-to-Python conversion but serve different purposes - one is the converted output, the other is quality assessment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,N/A,"Very low structural similarity. Agent 1 follows Python code structure with imports, functions, and executable statements. Agent 2 follows analytical report structure with findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Fundamentally different output types."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,input.sas,70,1,"Assuming standard Python conversion quality. File path suggests Python output but extension shows .sas creating ambiguity. Without full content visibility, assuming reasonable conversion quality with potential syntax compliance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer,95,1-8,"Well-structured analysis with clear findings. Proper formatting, logical flow from findings to conclusions to recommendations. Minor deduction for brevity - could provide more detailed technical analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,82,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs appear syntactically sound within their respective domains."

Recommendations,Recommendation,input.sas,N/A,N/A,"Provide complete Python code content for thorough evaluation. Clarify file extension discrepancy (.py vs .sas path)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_To_Python_Reviewer,N/A,N/A,"Expand analysis to include specific technical details about conversion quality, potential issues, and detailed recommendations for improvement."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"These outputs serve complementary purposes - one as converted code, other as quality review. Consider integrating both into a comprehensive conversion workflow with code output and quality assessment."
