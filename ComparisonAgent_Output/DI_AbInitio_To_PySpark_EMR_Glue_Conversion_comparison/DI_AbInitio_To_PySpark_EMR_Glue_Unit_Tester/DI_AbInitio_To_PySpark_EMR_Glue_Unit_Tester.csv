Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200 (Agent 1), Lines 1-250 (Agent 2)","Both agents produced comprehensive unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion testing. Agent 1 delivered a solid 10-test foundation with mock implementations, while Agent 2 provided an enhanced 15-test suite with actual imports and additional edge cases. Key differences include test coverage scope, implementation approach (mocks vs. actual imports), and schema handling complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 15-45 (both agents)","Both outputs address the same core objective of creating comprehensive unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. They share identical test case naming conventions (TC001-TC010), similar test scenarios (happy path, edge cases, negative tests), and equivalent validation approaches using pytest and chispa. Agent 2 extends the semantic scope with 5 additional test cases covering boundary values, field order validation, and enhanced error handling, representing a 15% expansion in test coverage while maintaining semantic alignment with the original intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 50-200 (Agent 1), Lines 50-250 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow identical structural patterns: header documentation, test case inventory table, pytest implementation with fixtures, and systematic test organization. Agent 1 uses a 10-test structure with mock implementations, while Agent 2 expands to 15 tests with actual imports. Key structural differences include: Agent 1 defines mock XFR functions inline (lines 50-70), while Agent 2 imports from actual modules (lines 45-50); Agent 1 uses basic schema definitions (lines 75-95), while Agent 2 imports complex schemas with DecimalType handling (lines 40-45). Both maintain consistent pytest fixture patterns and test method signatures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,92,"Lines 75-95, 150-170","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with valid Python syntax, proper pytest structure, and consistent schema definitions. Minor issues include: simplified mock implementations that may not fully represent production complexity (lines 50-70), basic error handling in test cases (lines 150-170), and potential type mismatch in mock pricing logic (line 65). All imports are valid, test methods are properly structured, and assertion patterns are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,"Lines 40-50, 180-200, 220-240","Agent 2 shows good syntactic correctness but has some complexity-related issues: imports from non-existent modules (Retail_Converted_DML, Retail_Converted_XFR) which would cause ImportError in actual execution (lines 40-50), more complex DecimalType usage that may have precision issues (lines 180-200), and some test cases with potentially unrealistic boundary value handling (lines 220-240). However, the pytest structure, fixture usage, and assertion patterns are all syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score across both agents, reflecting strong overall syntactic validity with minor implementation complexity issues in Agent 2 offset by Agent 1's solid foundation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 50-70, 75-95","Replace mock XFR functions with actual implementation stubs or interfaces to better represent production behavior. Enhance schema definitions to match production complexity including proper DecimalType precision handling. Add more comprehensive error handling patterns in test cases to cover production scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 40-50, 180-200","Ensure all imported modules (Retail_Converted_DML, Retail_Converted_XFR) exist or provide fallback mock implementations. Review DecimalType usage for precision consistency across test cases. Validate boundary value test cases against actual system limits to ensure realistic test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-250 (both)","Consider hybrid approach: use Agent 1's solid foundation with Agent 2's expanded test coverage. Implement proper CI/CD integration with both mock and integration test modes. Add performance benchmarking tests for large dataset scenarios. Ensure all test cases align with actual Ab Initio business logic requirements."
