Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion with pytest implementations. Agent_1 provided 10 test cases with mock XFR functions, while Agent_2 provided 15 test cases with actual imports from Retail_Converted modules. Semantic similarity is high (85/100) as both address the same testing requirements. Structural similarity is moderate (75/100) due to different test case counts and organization approaches. Correctness varies between agents with Agent_1 scoring 82/100 and Agent_2 scoring 78/100 due to import and implementation issues."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-200+ in both outputs","Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in their core purpose of creating comprehensive unit test suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. They share common test scenarios including happy path validation (TC001), NULL handling (TC002), missing columns (TC003), lookup failures (TC004), and empty datasets (TC005). The fundamental testing philosophy and coverage areas are highly aligned. Minor deductions for Agent_2's additional test cases (TC011-TC015) that extend beyond Agent_1's scope, and slight differences in error handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-50 (inventory), Lines 60-200+ (code)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case inventory tables followed by pytest implementations. However, structural differences include: Agent_1 has 10 test cases vs Agent_2's 15 test cases. Agent_1 uses mock XFR functions defined inline (lines 60-80), while Agent_2 imports from actual modules (lines 25-30). Test organization differs with Agent_2 having more granular boundary testing (TC014, TC015). Both use proper pytest fixtures and similar DataFrame testing patterns with chispa assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,82,"Lines 25-35, 60-80, 150-160","Python syntax is valid throughout. Proper pytest structure with fixtures and test functions. Mock implementations are syntactically correct but simplified. Minor issues: Line 25-30 mock functions are overly simplified and may not reflect real transformation complexity. Line 150+ some test assertions may be too generic. Import statements for chispa and pyspark are correct. Schema definitions are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,78,"Lines 25-35, 180-190, 250-260","Python syntax is generally valid with proper pytest structure. However, several correctness issues: Lines 25-30 imports from 'Retail_Converted_DML' and 'Retail_Converted_XFR' modules that may not exist in the actual environment. Line 180+ some test cases have incomplete error handling logic. Lines 250-260 boundary value testing uses potentially invalid DecimalType operations. Schema usage is more complex but may have type conversion issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,80,"","Average of Agent_1 (82) and Agent_2 (78). Both outputs demonstrate solid pytest implementation skills with proper test structure, fixtures, and DataFrame validation using chispa. Agent_1 is more conservative with mock implementations while Agent_2 attempts more realistic integration but introduces potential runtime issues with module dependencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 60-80, 120-140","Strengthen mock implementations to better reflect actual transformation logic complexity. Add more comprehensive edge case testing similar to Agent_2's boundary value tests (TC014-TC015). Consider adding schema validation tests and more detailed error message assertions. Improve test data variety and add performance testing considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 25-35, 180-190","Verify that imported modules (Retail_Converted_DML, Retail_Converted_XFR) exist and are accessible in the test environment. Add fallback mock implementations for cases where actual modules are unavailable. Fix potential DecimalType conversion issues in boundary testing. Improve error handling in negative test cases to be more specific about expected exception types."
