Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide comprehensive validation suites for Ab Initio to PySpark conversion with identical test case specifications but different implementation approaches. Agent_1_Output uses mock functions with simpler schemas, while Agent_2_Output integrates with actual DML/XFR modules and uses more complex data types."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs address the same core objective of validating Ab Initio to PySpark conversion. They share identical test case descriptions and overall validation strategy. However, Agent_1_Output uses mock transformation functions while Agent_2_Output imports from actual conversion modules (Retail_Converted_DML, Retail_Converted_XFR). Agent_2_Output demonstrates more realistic data types (DecimalType, DateType) and production-ready imports, while Agent_1_Output uses simplified string-based schemas for demonstration purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 15-180","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: header section, test case table, pytest implementation, and API cost tracking. The pytest structure is consistent with same fixture patterns, test function naming conventions, and assertion approaches. Minor differences exist in import statements and schema definitions, but the overall flow and decomposition approach are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,72,"Lines 25-30, 45-50, 120-125","Several syntax and logical issues: Line 25-30 show inconsistent schema field ordering in createDataFrame calls vs expected schemas. Lines 45-50 have undefined 'enriched_schema' references before proper definition. Lines 120-125 contain type casting test that uses string type for numeric field but expects exception without proper validation logic. Mock transformation functions lack proper error handling for invalid inputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,88,"Lines 35-40, 150-155","Minor issues with schema consistency: Lines 35-40 show some potential type mismatches in DecimalType usage. Lines 150-155 have boundary value tests that may not handle edge cases properly. However, proper imports from actual modules, consistent use of production data types, and more robust error handling make this significantly more syntactically sound."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Lines 25-50","Replace mock transformation functions with actual imports from conversion modules. Fix schema consistency issues in createDataFrame calls. Add proper error handling and validation logic for edge cases. Ensure all referenced schemas are properly defined before use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Lines 35-40, 150-155","Verify DecimalType usage consistency across all test cases. Enhance boundary condition testing with more comprehensive edge case coverage. Add more detailed assertion messages for better test failure diagnostics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized error message validation, 2) More comprehensive data quality checks, 3) Performance testing for large datasets, 4) Integration with actual CI/CD pipelines, 5) Documentation of expected vs actual Ab Initio behavior differences."
