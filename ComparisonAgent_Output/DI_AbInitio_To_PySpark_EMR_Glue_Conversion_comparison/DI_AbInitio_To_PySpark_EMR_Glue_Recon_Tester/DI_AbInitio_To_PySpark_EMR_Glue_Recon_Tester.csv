Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-300,"Both outputs provide comprehensive orchestration scripts for AbInitio to PySpark migration validation on AWS. Agent 1 delivers a monolithic approach with embedded reconciliation logic, while Agent 2 implements a modular architecture with separate DML/XFR imports. Both handle AWS services (EMR, Glue, S3, SSM) effectively but differ in code organization and error handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-300,"Both outputs address the same core objective: orchestrating AbInitio graph execution, PySpark job submission, and output reconciliation on AWS. They share identical high-level workflow (run AbInitio via SSM, submit PySpark to EMR/Glue, compare outputs, generate reports). Key semantic differences: Agent 1 uses embedded reconciliation script (lines 180-250), Agent 2 imports from external modules (lines 15-25). Both implement similar AWS service interactions and S3 operations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-300,"Significant structural differences despite similar functionality. Agent 1 follows monolithic pattern with embedded RECONCILIATION_SCRIPT constant (lines 180-250), single main() function (lines 80-150), and inline utility functions. Agent 2 implements modular architecture with external imports (lines 15-25), separate reconciliation function (lines 150-220), and better separation of concerns. Both use similar AWS client initialization patterns but different function organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,1-300,"Minor syntax issues: Line 95 has potential string formatting vulnerability in SSM command construction. Line 180 RECONCILIATION_SCRIPT uses triple quotes correctly. Line 220 proper exception handling in reconciliation script. Line 250 correct boto3 S3 operations. Overall syntactically sound with robust error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,1-300,"Excellent syntax correctness: Lines 15-25 proper import statements for external modules. Line 80 secure AWS config loading from environment. Line 120 proper SSM command execution with timeout. Line 180 correct PySpark DataFrame operations. Line 250 proper exception handling throughout. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual agent scores (92 + 95) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, AWS SDK usage, and error handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 95-100,"Consider parameterizing SSM commands to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Extract reconciliation logic to separate module for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 15-25,"Ensure external module dependencies (Retail_Converted_DML, Retail_Converted_XFR) are properly documented and version-controlled. Consider adding module availability checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-300,"Both implementations are production-ready with strong AWS integration. Agent 2's modular approach offers better maintainability, while Agent 1's monolithic design may be simpler for deployment. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 2's modularity with Agent 1's self-contained reconciliation logic."
