Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents deliver comprehensive orchestration scripts for AbInitio to PySpark migration validation on AWS EMR/Glue. Agent 1 provides a self-contained solution with embedded reconciliation logic, while Agent 2 offers a more modular approach with external imports. Both implement robust error handling, AWS security best practices, and detailed logging. The scripts share 85% semantic similarity in core functionality, 75% structural similarity with different architectural approaches, and both achieve high correctness scores with minor syntax considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both agents address the same core objective: orchestrating AbInitio graph execution, PySpark job submission, and reconciliation reporting. Agent 1 uses a monolithic approach with embedded reconciliation script (lines 180-220), while Agent 2 imports external modules (lines 15-25). Both implement identical AWS service integrations (SSM, EMR, S3), error handling patterns, and validation workflows. Key semantic differences: Agent 1 uses string-embedded PySpark code, Agent 2 uses imported modules; Agent 1 focuses on EMR-only execution, Agent 2 supports both EMR and Glue. The core business logic and data flow remain semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 60-90, 120-180, 250-300","Structural differences emerge in architectural approach. Agent 1 follows a linear monolithic structure with embedded constants (RECONCILIATION_SCRIPT at lines 180-220), while Agent 2 uses modular imports and conditional execution paths. Both use similar function decomposition: AWS client setup, SSM command execution, job submission, and validation. Agent 1 has 8 main functions in sequential flow, Agent 2 has 6 functions with branching logic for EMR/Glue selection. Control flow patterns differ: Agent 1 uses direct EMR step submission, Agent 2 implements conditional service selection. Both maintain consistent error handling structure and logging patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,92,"Lines 45, 78, 156, 189","Minor syntax issues: Line 45 - missing import for 'tempfile' module used at line 78; Line 156 - potential undefined variable 'local_tmp' scope issue; Line 189 - string concatenation in RECONCILIATION_SCRIPT may have escaping issues with embedded quotes. Overall structure is syntactically sound with proper exception handling, boto3 client usage, and AWS API calls. All function signatures are correct and variable scoping is mostly proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,"Lines 25, 67, 145, 178, 203","Several syntax concerns: Line 25 - imports from 'Retail_Converted_DML' and 'Retail_Converted_XFR' modules not defined or provided; Line 67 - undefined variable 'expected_file' parameter not passed to verify_s3_output function; Line 145 - potential scope issue with 'spark' variable in reconciliation function; Line 178 - undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt_output_path' parameter naming inconsistency; Line 203 - missing error handling for S3 upload operation. Core Python syntax is correct but has more undefined references than Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both demonstrate strong Python syntax knowledge and AWS SDK usage, with Agent 1 having fewer undefined references and better self-containment, while Agent 2 has more modular design but relies on external dependencies that may not be available."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Resolve import dependencies: Add missing 'tempfile' import at top of file. Fix variable scoping: Ensure 'local_tmp' variable is properly scoped across functions. Improve string handling: Review RECONCILIATION_SCRIPT string for potential escaping issues with embedded quotes and multiline formatting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Define missing modules: Provide implementations for 'Retail_Converted_DML' and 'Retail_Converted_XFR' modules or make them optional imports with fallbacks. Fix function signatures: Correct 'verify_s3_output' function call to include missing 'expected_file' parameter. Improve error handling: Add try-catch blocks for S3 upload operations and other AWS API calls that currently lack error handling. Resolve variable naming: Fix inconsistent parameter naming in reconciliation function."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Consider hybrid approach: Combine Agent 1's self-contained design with Agent 2's modular architecture for optimal maintainability. Standardize configuration: Both agents should use consistent configuration management patterns. Enhance testing: Add unit tests for core functions and mock AWS services for testing. Improve documentation: Add more detailed docstrings for complex functions like reconciliation logic. Consider performance: Both agents could benefit from parallel execution of independent validation steps."
