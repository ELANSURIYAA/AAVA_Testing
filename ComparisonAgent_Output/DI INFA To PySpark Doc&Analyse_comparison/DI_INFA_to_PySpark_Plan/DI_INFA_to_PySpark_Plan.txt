# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation reports for PySpark conversion from Informatica. AVA_Agent_1 estimates $0.31 USD runtime cost and 3.5 hours effort, while AVA_Agent_2 estimates $0.30 USD runtime cost and 4.0 hours effort. Both identify the same workflow and provide similar technical analysis with slight variations in detail and formatting.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address identical goals of PySpark conversion cost estimation. They analyze the same Informatica workflow (wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor), provide similar runtime cost estimates ($0.30-0.31), and break down effort into manual fixes and validation. AVA_Agent_2 provides more Azure Databricks context while AVA_Agent_1 focuses more on GCP Dataproc. Minor differences in technical emphasis but same overall intent.

**Key Similarities:**
- Same workflow identification (wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor)
- Similar data volume estimates (~500 MB)
- Comparable runtime cost estimates
- Identical effort breakdown approach
- Same API cost reporting structure

**Key Differences:**
- AVA_Agent_1 focuses on GCP Dataproc Serverless
- AVA_Agent_2 emphasizes Azure Databricks environment
- Slight variation in effort hour estimates (3.5 vs 4.0 hours)

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both follow nearly identical structural organization: Cost Estimation (section 1), Code Fixing and Testing (section 2), API Cost (section 3). Both use numbered subsections and summary tables. AVA_Agent_1 has more granular subsection breakdown (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) while AVA_Agent_2 uses cleaner markdown formatting with better visual hierarchy.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Three main sections in both outputs
- Consistent use of numbered hierarchies
- Summary tables in both reports
- Similar logical flow from cost → effort → API consumption

**Structural Differences:**
- AVA_Agent_1: More granular subsection numbering
- AVA_Agent_2: Cleaner markdown formatting with better visual separation
- Different table formatting approaches

### Correctness

**AVA_Agent_1 (Score: 95/100)**
Well-formed markdown with consistent section numbering. Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost calculation presentation and table alignment (lines 15-20, 45-50). All internal references are valid and calculations are mathematically correct.

**AVA_Agent_2 (Score: 97/100)**
Excellent markdown formatting with clean visual hierarchy. Consistent table formatting and proper section organization (lines 10-15, 40-45). All calculations are accurate and internal references are valid. Minor improvement over Agent 1 in presentation clarity.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 96/100)**
Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, valid calculations, and consistent internal structure. AVA_Agent_2 slightly superior in formatting consistency.
