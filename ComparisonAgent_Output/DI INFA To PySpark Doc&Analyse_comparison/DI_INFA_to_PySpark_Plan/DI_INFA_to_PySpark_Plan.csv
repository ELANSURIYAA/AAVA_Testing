Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for PySpark conversion of Informatica workflow wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor. Agent_1_Output estimates $0.31 runtime cost and 3.5 hours effort, while Agent_2_Output estimates $0.30 runtime cost and 4.0 hours effort. Both identify the same core transformation requirements and similar technical approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-150,"Both outputs address identical goals: cost estimation and effort estimation for PySpark conversion. Both correctly identify the workflow as simple linear ETL with minimal transformations. Key semantic alignments: same data volume (500MB), same transformation complexity assessment, same technical requirements (parameterization, timestamp, JDBC, error handling). Minor differences in cost calculation methodology and effort breakdown granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-150,"Both follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Cost Estimation with PySpark Runtime Cost subsection, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with Manual Fixes and Output Validation subsections, 3) API Cost Consumption, 4) Summary table. Agent_2_Output includes additional Azure Databricks environment details and slightly different subsection numbering (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 vs simpler numbering)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,1-75,"Excellent syntax and internal consistency. Proper markdown formatting, consistent parameter references ($$Audit_Year, SESSSTARTTIME), accurate mathematical calculations ($0.31 = 3 nodes x 0.17 hour x $0.60), proper table formatting. Minor issue: API cost format inconsistency (backticks vs plain text in different sections)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,96,76-150,"Very good syntax and internal consistency. Proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, accurate cost calculations. Minor issues: inconsistent section numbering format (### vs ##), slight formatting variation in summary table alignment, and one instance of incomplete sentence structure in line 95 ('maining logic' should be 'remaining logic')."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown structure, consistent technical terminology, and accurate mathematical calculations. Minor formatting inconsistencies and typos prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,1-75,"Maintain the concise and direct approach. Consider adding environment-specific details like Agent_2_Output for better context. Fix API cost formatting consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,76-150,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Standardize section numbering format throughout document. Proofread for minor typos like 'maining logic'. Consider condensing some sections for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide valuable and accurate analysis. Consider standardizing the cost calculation methodology and effort breakdown granularity for consistency across similar analyses. Both could benefit from adding confidence intervals or risk factors to cost estimates."
