Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-100","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for PySpark conversion with similar methodologies and conclusions. Output_1 estimates $0.31 runtime cost and 3.5 hours effort, while Output_2 estimates $0.30 runtime cost and 4.0 hours effort. Both follow structured analysis approaches with detailed breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 60-80","Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark conversion cost estimation for the same Informatica workflow. They analyze the same data volume (500MB), transformation complexity, and provide similar cost calculations. Minor differences in emphasis on Azure vs GCP environments and slight variation in effort estimates (3.5 vs 4.0 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 10-30, 45-65","Both follow similar three-section structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost. Output_1 uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1) while Output_2 uses markdown headers. Both include summary tables and detailed breakdowns, though Output_2 has slightly more detailed subsection organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,"Lines 25, 40, 75","Well-formatted document with consistent internal references, valid cost calculations ($0.31), proper effort breakdown (3.5 hours total), and accurate API cost (0.0523 USD). Minor formatting inconsistency in summary table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,96,"Lines 20, 35, 70","Properly structured with valid calculations ($0.30 cost, 4.0 hours effort), consistent markdown formatting, and accurate API cost (0.0520 USD). Minor inconsistency in section numbering depth and table formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"N/A","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid calculations, and consistent internal structure. Average of individual scores."
