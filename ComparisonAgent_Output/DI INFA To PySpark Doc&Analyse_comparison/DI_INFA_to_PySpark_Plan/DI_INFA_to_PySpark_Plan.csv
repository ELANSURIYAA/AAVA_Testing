Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation reports for PySpark conversion from Informatica. AVA_Agent_1 estimates $0.31 USD runtime cost and 3.5 hours effort, while AVA_Agent_2 estimates $0.30 USD runtime cost and 4.0 hours effort. Both identify the same workflow and provide similar technical analysis with slight variations in detail and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address identical goals of PySpark conversion cost estimation. They analyze the same Informatica workflow (wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor), provide similar runtime cost estimates ($0.30-0.31), and break down effort into manual fixes and validation. AVA_Agent_2 provides more Azure Databricks context while AVA_Agent_1 focuses more on GCP Dataproc. Minor differences in technical emphasis but same overall intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both follow nearly identical structural organization: Cost Estimation (section 1), Code Fixing and Testing (section 2), API Cost (section 3). Both use numbered subsections and summary tables. AVA_Agent_1 has more granular subsection breakdown (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) while AVA_Agent_2 uses cleaner markdown formatting with better visual hierarchy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVA_Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 45-50","Well-formed markdown with consistent section numbering. Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost calculation presentation and table alignment. All internal references are valid and calculations are mathematically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVA_Agent_2,97,"Lines 10-15, 40-45","Excellent markdown formatting with clean visual hierarchy. Consistent table formatting and proper section organization. All calculations are accurate and internal references are valid. Minor improvement over Agent 1 in presentation clarity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, valid calculations, and consistent internal structure. AVA_Agent_2 slightly superior in formatting consistency."
