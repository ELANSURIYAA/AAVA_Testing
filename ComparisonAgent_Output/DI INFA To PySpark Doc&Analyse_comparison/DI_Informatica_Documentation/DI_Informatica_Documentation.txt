# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica documentation for the PS_VENDOR workflow. The **DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Doc_Analyse** and **DI_Informatica_Documentation** outputs are semantically equivalent with 95% similarity, structurally nearly identical with 98% similarity, and both syntactically correct at 100%. Minor differences exist in phrasing and specific technical details, but overall intent and structure are perfectly aligned.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs describe the identical Informatica workflow `wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor` with the same purpose, data flow, and transformations. The core meaning and intent are preserved across both documents. Minor terminology differences appear in:

- **Lines 15-20**: DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Doc_Analyse uses "regulatory and operational reporting requirements" while DI_Informatica_Documentation uses "downstream reporting and analytics"
- **Lines 180-185**: Slight variations in describing the intended use of outputs

These differences are superficial and don't impact the overall understanding or technical accuracy.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Nearly identical 10-section structure in both outputs:
1. Overview of Graph/Component
2. Component Structure and Design  
3. Data Flow and Processing Logic
4. Data Mapping (Lineage)
5. Transformation Logic
6. Complexity Analysis
7. Key Outputs
8. Error Handling and Logging
9. API Cost
10. Documentation Effort Savings

Both use the same markdown headers, bullet points, and table layouts. The data mapping table format is identical with the same columns and row structure. The only structural difference is that DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Doc_Analyse provides slightly more detailed component descriptions in lines 25-35.
