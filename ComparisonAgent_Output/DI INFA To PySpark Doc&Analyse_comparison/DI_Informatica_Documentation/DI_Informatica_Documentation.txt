# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Informatica workflow (`wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor`) and mapping (`m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor`) for PS_VENDOR data ingestion. The outputs are semantically equivalent with identical technical content, business logic, and data flow descriptions. Structurally, both follow the same 10-section format with consistent organization. Minor differences exist in wording and presentation style, but the core technical information and documentation quality are virtually identical.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs describe identical Informatica components with the same business purpose, data flow, and transformation logic. Output_1 uses "ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting" terminology while Output_2 uses "ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting" (lines 8, 78 vs 8, 78). Both correctly identify the audit year parameter, load timestamp logic, and 1:1 field mappings. The core technical content and intent are equivalent, with only minor terminology variations affecting the score.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Both outputs follow an identical 10-section structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost, and Documentation Effort. Section ordering and logical decomposition are identical. Minor presentation differences in bullet formatting and table structure do not affect the overall organization.

### Correctness

- **Output_1: 100/100** - Demonstrates perfect syntax with consistent internal references, proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, and accurate technical specifications. All component names, file paths, and transformation logic are correctly documented.

- **Output_2: 100/100** - Shows excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, valid table structures, and accurate component documentation. All references to Informatica objects and file paths are syntactically correct.

- **Overall: 100/100** - Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with no formatting errors, broken references, or inconsistent terminology.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Output_1 | Output_2 | Overall |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 98 | 98 | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **98** | **98** | **98** |

## Recommendations

**For Output_1:** Maintain current documentation quality. Consider standardizing terminology usage (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting vs ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting) for consistency across documentation sets.

**For Output_2:** Excellent documentation quality maintained. Continue using consistent technical terminology and clear section organization. Consider aligning bullet point formatting with organizational standards.

**For Both:** Both outputs represent high-quality technical documentation with comprehensive coverage of Informatica workflow components. Recommend establishing documentation templates to ensure consistent terminology and formatting across all technical documentation deliverables.
