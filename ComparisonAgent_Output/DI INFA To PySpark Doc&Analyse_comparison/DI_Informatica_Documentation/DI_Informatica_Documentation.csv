Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Informatica workflow (wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) and mapping (m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) for PS_VENDOR data ingestion. The outputs are semantically equivalent with identical technical content, business logic, and data flow descriptions. Structurally, both follow the same 10-section format with consistent organization. Minor differences exist in wording and presentation style, but the core technical information and documentation quality are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs describe identical Informatica components with same business purpose, data flow, and transformation logic. Output_1 uses 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' terminology while Output_2 uses 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' (lines 8, 78 vs 8, 78). Both correctly identify audit year parameter, load timestamp logic, and 1:1 field mappings. Core technical content and intent are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,N/A,"Both outputs follow identical 10-section structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost, Documentation Effort. Section ordering and logical decomposition are identical. Minor presentation differences in bullet formatting and table structure do not affect overall organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,100,N/A,"Output_1 demonstrates perfect syntax with consistent internal references, proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, and accurate technical specifications. All component names, file paths, and transformation logic are correctly documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,N/A,"Output_2 shows excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, valid table structures, and accurate component documentation. All references to Informatica objects and file paths are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with no formatting errors, broken references, or inconsistent terminology. Technical documentation standards are met in both cases."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,N/A,"Maintain current documentation quality. Consider standardizing terminology usage (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting vs ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting) for consistency across documentation sets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent documentation quality maintained. Continue using consistent technical terminology and clear section organization. Consider aligning bullet point formatting with organizational standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs represent high-quality technical documentation with comprehensive coverage of Informatica workflow components. Recommend establishing documentation templates to ensure consistent terminology and formatting across all technical documentation deliverables."
