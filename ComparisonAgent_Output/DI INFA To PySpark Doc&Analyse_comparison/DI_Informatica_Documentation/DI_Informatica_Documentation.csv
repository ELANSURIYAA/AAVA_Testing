Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive Informatica PS_VENDOR workflow documentation with identical semantic intent and structural organization. Agent_1 provides slightly more detailed technical specifications and file paths, while Agent_2 offers cleaner formatting in some sections. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy and completeness for enterprise ETL documentation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs address identical business objectives for PS_VENDOR data ingestion and transformation. Core concepts, data flow logic, and transformation requirements are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in technical detail depth (Agent_1 more comprehensive in file paths and connection details) and phrasing variations account for 5-point deduction."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,,"Nearly identical 10-section structure with same headers, logical flow, and content organization. Both follow: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost, Documentation Savings. Minor formatting differences in tables and bullet points account for 2-point deduction."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical specifications, and complete section coverage. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical specifications, and complete section coverage. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown, consistent formatting, and accurate technical documentation standards."
