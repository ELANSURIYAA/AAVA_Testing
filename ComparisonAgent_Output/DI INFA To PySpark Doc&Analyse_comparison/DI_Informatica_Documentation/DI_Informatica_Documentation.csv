Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs document the same Informatica PS_VENDOR workflow with identical core functionality. Agent_Output_1 provides more comprehensive technical details including specific file paths and connection names, while Agent_Output_2 offers cleaner organization and better readability. Key differences include terminology variations (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting vs reporting), file path specificity, and documentation depth. Both achieve the same documentation objective with 85% semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs document identical Informatica workflow functionality for PS_VENDOR data processing. Core purpose, data flow, and transformation logic are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in terminology (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting vs reporting on lines 15, 45) and emphasis on specific technical details don't affect overall meaning. Both correctly identify the audit year parameter, load timestamp logic, and 1:1 field mappings."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200","Structural organization is nearly identical with same 10-section format: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost, and Documentation Effort. Both use consistent markdown formatting, identical table structures for data mapping (lines 80-120), and same logical flow progression. Minor variations in subsection organization within sections 2 and 8."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_1,95,"Lines 25, 45, 65, 85","Syntax is correct with proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, and consistent internal references. Minor issues: inconsistent terminology 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be a placeholder or encoding issue on lines 25, 45. All technical references are accurate including file paths, transformation names, and Oracle connection details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_2,97,"Lines 20, 40, 60","Excellent syntax correctness with clean markdown formatting, properly structured tables, and consistent terminology throughout. All internal references are valid. Technical accuracy is maintained across all sections. Same placeholder issue with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' on lines 20, 40 but less frequent than Agent_Output_1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and valid technical references. Average score reflects minor terminology inconsistencies but overall excellent documentation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_1,90,"Lines 25, 45","Standardize terminology by replacing 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' with 'reporting' for consistency. Consider adding more specific technical details like connection string formats and parameter validation rules to match the comprehensive approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_2,95,"Lines 20, 40","Fix the same terminology issue with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' placeholder. The cleaner organization and readability make this the preferred template. Consider adding the detailed file path specifications from Agent_Output_1 for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,92,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs successfully document the Informatica workflow with high accuracy. Recommend creating a hybrid version combining Agent_Output_2's clean organization with Agent_Output_1's comprehensive technical details. Address the terminology placeholder issue in both versions for production use."
