Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs document the same Informatica workflow (wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) for PS_VENDOR data ingestion from flat file to Oracle table. They share identical technical specifications, data mappings, and transformation logic with 95% semantic alignment, 88% structural similarity, and high correctness scores. Minor differences exist in section organization and descriptive language."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs describe identical workflow purpose, data transformations, and business logic. Core technical specifications match exactly: same source (PS_VENDOR_S4), transformations (exp_Vendor), target (PS_VENDOR), parameters ($$Audit_Year), and data mappings. Minor semantic differences in descriptive language and emphasis on regulatory vs operational aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both follow similar 10-section documentation structure with identical section numbering and flow. Key structural differences: Agent 1 uses 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' terminology (lines 15, 45, 180), Agent 2 uses 'reporting' (lines 15, 45, 180). Agent 1 has more detailed error handling section structure. Data mapping tables are structurally identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 80-85","Excellent syntax and formatting. Minor issue: inconsistent terminology 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be a placeholder or encoding issue in lines 15, 45, 180, 195. All technical references, table structures, and internal consistency are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,"All lines","Excellent syntax, formatting, and internal consistency. All technical specifications, references, and documentation structure are correct. Clean terminology usage throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper documentation formatting and valid Informatica workflow specifications."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Fix terminology inconsistencies by replacing 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' with proper terms like 'reporting' or 'analytics' in lines 15, 45, 180, 195. Consider standardizing error handling section structure to match Agent_2's cleaner organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent documentation quality. Consider adding more detailed error handling subsections as shown in Agent_1 to enhance completeness. Maintain current clean terminology and formatting standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica workflow documentation. Recommend establishing consistent terminology standards and section organization templates for future documentation efforts. Consider automated validation to catch placeholder text issues."
