Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica workflow analysis for PS_VENDOR data migration to PySpark. Output 1 and Output 2 demonstrate nearly identical technical understanding with 95% semantic alignment, 92% structural similarity, and 99% overall correctness. Key differences include minor formatting variations and terminology consistency. Both outputs successfully identify the workflow as low-complexity (score 15/100) with straightforward migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs correctly identify the workflow objective as PS_VENDOR data ingestion from flat file to Oracle with audit enrichment. Core technical details are semantically equivalent: single mapping, 2 transformations, no lookups, complexity score 15. Minor semantic differences in business objective phrasing (Lines 15-20) and optimization recommendations (Lines 180-200) but same underlying meaning and technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200","Identical 5-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques. Both use same subsection organization and table format for complexity metrics. Minor structural differences in bullet point formatting (Lines 60-80), section header styling, and paragraph organization. Overall flow and logical decomposition are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output1,98,"Line 20, 45","Minor formatting inconsistency with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appearing instead of 'reporting' in two instances. All technical content is syntactically correct with proper section headers, valid table structure, and consistent markdown formatting otherwise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output2,100,,"Clean formatting throughout with consistent terminology and proper markdown structure. All section headers, tables, and technical content are syntactically correct with no formatting errors or inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor formatting issues in Output 1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output1,,"Lines 20, 45","Fix terminology consistency by replacing 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' with 'reporting' for improved readability and professionalism."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_INFA_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output2,,,"Maintain current high quality standards. Consider adding more specific line references in optimization recommendations for enhanced clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis suitable for PySpark migration planning. Consider standardizing formatting conventions and adding more detailed error handling scenarios for production implementation."
