Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the same Informatica workflow (wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) for PS_VENDOR data ingestion. They demonstrate high semantic alignment with identical business objectives, technical scope, and migration recommendations. Structural organization is nearly identical across all major sections. Both outputs are syntactically correct with proper formatting and consistent internal references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 51-100","Both outputs address identical workflow analysis scope with same business objective (vendor master data integration), technical components (single mapping, flat file source, Oracle target), and migration approach. Minor differences in phrasing and emphasis (e.g., 'orchestrates the ingestion' vs 'orchestrate the ingestion', 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' vs 'reporting') do not affect core meaning. Both identify same complexity score (15) and migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 30-40","Nearly identical section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques. Both use tabular format for complexity metrics with same categories. Minor variations in subsection organization (Agent 1 uses more bullet points in Manual Adjustments, Agent 2 uses more descriptive paragraphs) and header formatting differences (## vs # for some sections)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 5, 25","Proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid technical terminology. Minor issue with 'maining logic' (line 25) appears to be typo for 'joining logic'. All other syntax and formatting is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,,"Excellent markdown formatting, consistent structure, proper technical terminology throughout. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected. All internal references and technical details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and consistent technical content. Average of individual scores (98+99)/2 = 98.5, rounded to 99."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Address minor typo 'maining logic' on line 25. Consider adding more detailed error handling examples in Manual Adjustments section to match comprehensiveness of Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent analysis with no significant issues identified. Consider standardizing header formatting to match markdown best practices consistently throughout."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide high-quality Informatica workflow analysis suitable for PySpark migration planning. Consider consolidating into single standardized template for future analyses. Both demonstrate strong technical accuracy and comprehensive coverage of migration requirements."
