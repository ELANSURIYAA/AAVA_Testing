Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents produced comprehensive Informatica workflow analysis documents for PS_VENDOR data ingestion and PySpark migration. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical business objectives and technical understanding. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with consistent section organization despite minor formatting differences. Correctness scores are excellent for both agents (Agent_1: 95/100, Agent_2: 98/100) with proper syntax and internal consistency. Overall assessment: 93/100 - High-quality, aligned outputs suitable for migration planning."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both agents correctly identify the workflow purpose (PS_VENDOR data ingestion), business objectives (audit enrichment and Oracle loading), and technical requirements (PySpark migration). Key semantic alignments include: identical complexity assessment (score 15/100), same transformation count (2), matching DML operations (INSERT/TRUNCATE), and consistent optimization recommendations. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 uses 'maining logic' terminology while Agent_2 uses standard 'joining logic', and Agent_2 provides more specific file path examples."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Structural differences: Agent_1 uses more bullet points and concise formatting, while Agent_2 employs more detailed subsections and markdown tables. Agent_2 includes additional subsection 'High-Complexity Areas' under section 2. Both maintain consistent technical depth and coverage scope."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15, 23, 47","Minor issues: Line 15 contains non-standard term 'maining logic' (should be 'joining logic'). Line 23 has inconsistent spacing in complexity table. Line 47 uses informal phrasing 'No nested expressions, no lookups, no maining logic' - should maintain formal technical language. Otherwise excellent syntax, proper markdown formatting, accurate technical references, and consistent internal structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Line 89","Excellent overall correctness with proper markdown syntax, consistent formatting, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issue at Line 89: slight redundancy in stating 'End of Analysis for: wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor.txt__ai85ctd_' which appears to be a processing artifact. All technical references are accurate, section structure is consistent, and business logic descriptions are precise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper document structure, accurate technical content, and consistent formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor terminology and formatting issues that do not impact technical accuracy or usability. Both documents are production-ready for migration planning purposes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Standardize technical terminology by replacing 'maining logic' with 'joining logic' throughout the document. Improve table formatting consistency in complexity metrics section. Adopt more formal language in technical assessments to maintain professional tone."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Remove processing artifacts from document footer to maintain clean presentation. Consider adding more bullet-point summaries for improved readability, following Agent_1's concise formatting approach in key sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs are high-quality and suitable for PySpark migration planning. Consider creating a hybrid approach combining Agent_1's concise formatting with Agent_2's detailed subsection organization. Standardize file path examples and ensure consistent terminology across all technical documentation. Both agents successfully identified all critical migration considerations including parameterization, error handling, and optimization techniques."
