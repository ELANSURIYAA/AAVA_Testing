Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the same Informatica workflow (wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) for PS_VENDOR data ingestion and PySpark migration. The analyses are highly similar in content, structure, and technical accuracy, with minor differences in presentation and specific details. Both achieve the same analytical objectives with comparable depth and quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs analyze the identical Informatica workflow and mapping (wkf_aufi016d_PS_Vendor, m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) with the same business objective of vendor master data ingestion. Minor differences: Agent 1 mentions 'regulatory and operational reporting' (line 7) while Agent 2 specifies 'PeopleSoft to Profit Recovery' transfer (line 7). Agent 1 uses 'maining logic' terminology (line 31) while Agent 2 uses standard terminology. Both identify the same complexity score (15), transformations, and migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 5-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques. Minor structural differences: Agent 1 uses more detailed bullet formatting in sections 4-5, while Agent 2 uses cleaner subsection headers. Agent 1 includes a summary paragraph at the end (lines 85-87), while Agent 2 ends with a single summary line. Table structures are identical with same metrics and values."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,31,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and consistent references. Minor issue: uses non-standard term 'maining logic' (line 31) instead of 'joining logic' or 'complex logic'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent references, and standard technical terminology throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and structure. Average of individual scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,31,"Replace non-standard terminology 'maining logic' with 'complex logic' or 'joining logic' for better technical clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,,"Maintain current high quality standards. Consider adding more detailed bullet formatting for enhanced readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs provide excellent analysis quality. Consider standardizing terminology and formatting conventions for consistency across similar analyses."
