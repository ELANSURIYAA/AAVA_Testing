Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica workflow analysis for PS_VENDOR data ingestion with PySpark migration guidance. Agent_1 focuses on regulatory compliance and auditability while Agent_2 emphasizes PeopleSoft to Profit Recovery data transfer. Both identify low complexity (score 15) with minimal transformations and provide detailed migration recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-150,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Informatica workflow for PySpark migration. Minor differences in business context framing: Agent_1 emphasizes 'regulatory and operational reporting' while Agent_2 focuses on 'PeopleSoft to Profit Recovery' transfer. Both identify identical technical components and migration challenges."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,1-150,"Nearly identical document structure with 5 main sections: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Both use consistent markdown formatting, tables for metrics, and bullet-point organization. Minor variations in subsection ordering and header formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,45-50,"Minor formatting inconsistency in line 47 where 'maining logic' should be 'joining logic'. All technical details, syntax references, and Informatica-specific terminology are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,1-150,"Excellent technical accuracy throughout. All Informatica components, transformations, and PySpark migration recommendations are correctly specified. Proper use of technical terminology and accurate complexity scoring."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive coverage of Informatica-to-PySpark migration requirements. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting issue in Agent_1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,45-50,"Address the terminology error 'maining logic' to 'joining logic' in line 47 for improved technical precision."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,1-150,"Excellent technical documentation. Consider adding more specific examples of PySpark code snippets for transformation logic to enhance practical migration guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for Informatica-to-PySpark migration. Consider standardizing business context framing and adding more detailed error handling examples for production implementation."
