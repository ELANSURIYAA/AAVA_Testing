Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica workflow analysis for PS_VENDOR data ingestion supporting PySpark migration. Output 1 focuses on regulatory compliance and auditability while Output 2 emphasizes PeopleSoft to Profit Recovery data transfer. Both identify low complexity (score 15) with minimal transformations and provide migration guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-15; 45-60; 80-95,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Informatica workflow for PySpark migration. Minor differences in business context framing: Output 1 emphasizes 'regulatory and operational reporting' while Output 2 focuses on 'PeopleSoft to Profit Recovery' transfer. Both identify identical technical components and migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-100,"Nearly identical document structure with 5 main sections: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Both use consistent markdown formatting, tables for metrics, and bullet points for details. Minor variations in subsection organization and table formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 25-35; 70-75,"Well-formed markdown with consistent formatting. Minor issues: 'maining logic' should be 'main logic' (line 32), and 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be corrupted text (lines 8, 75). All technical details are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,Lines 1-100,"Excellent syntax and formatting throughout. Proper markdown structure, consistent table formatting, and clear section organization. All technical references and code snippets are correctly formatted. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minimal formatting issues."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,Lines 8; 32; 75,"Correct text corruption issues: 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' should be 'reporting' and 'maining logic' should be 'main logic'. Consider adding more specific business context details as shown in Output 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 1-100,"Maintain current high quality standards. Consider incorporating the regulatory compliance emphasis from Output 1 to provide more comprehensive business context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 45-60; 80-95,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) More specific PySpark code examples for parameter handling, 2) Detailed error handling implementation patterns, 3) Performance benchmarking recommendations for the migration process."
