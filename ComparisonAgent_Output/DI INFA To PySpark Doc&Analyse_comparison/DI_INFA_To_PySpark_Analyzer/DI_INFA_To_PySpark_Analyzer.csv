Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-85,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Informatica workflow analysis for PS_VENDOR data ingestion with PySpark migration guidance. Agent 1 delivers structured analysis with detailed complexity scoring (15/100) and systematic optimization recommendations. Agent 2 provides similar content with enhanced business context and clearer formatting. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor structural and presentation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-85,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: Informatica workflow analysis for PS_VENDOR vendor master data ingestion and PySpark migration. Core technical concepts align perfectly including workflow orchestration (lines 7-12), complexity assessment (lines 17-35), and migration strategies (lines 50-70). Minor semantic differences in business context emphasis and terminology choices (e.g. 'audit enrichment' vs 'enrichment') but overall intent and meaning are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-85,"Both outputs follow similar 5-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Agent 1 uses numbered sections with detailed subsections while Agent 2 uses ## headers with enhanced formatting. Complexity metrics tables are structurally identical (lines 17-35). Flow and logical decomposition are nearly identical with minor presentation variations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,17-35,"Excellent technical accuracy with comprehensive complexity metrics table, correct Informatica terminology, and accurate PySpark migration guidance. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 4 with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' instead of 'reporting'. All technical specifications, file paths, and transformation details are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,1-85,"Outstanding technical accuracy with proper markdown formatting, consistent terminology, and comprehensive coverage. All Informatica components, file paths, and PySpark migration strategies are correctly specified. Clean syntax throughout with no formatting errors or inconsistencies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive coverage of Informatica workflow analysis and PySpark migration requirements. Agent 2 shows slightly better consistency in formatting and terminology usage."
