# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison could not be completed due to missing agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` that were not replaced with actual content.

**Overall Assessment**: Unable to perform meaningful comparison without actual agent outputs.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The placeholder variables indicate that the system expected real content but received template markers instead.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100) 
Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. No structural analysis is possible with placeholder content.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: Score 0/100 - No output provided for syntax validation
- **Agent 2**: Score 0/100 - No output provided for syntax validation  
- **Overall**: Score 0/100 - Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace the placeholder variables with real agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison and validation.

2. **Verify Input Processing**: Ensure the template variable substitution system is working correctly before invoking the comparison agent.

3. **Content Validation**: Implement input validation to detect and handle placeholder content gracefully.
