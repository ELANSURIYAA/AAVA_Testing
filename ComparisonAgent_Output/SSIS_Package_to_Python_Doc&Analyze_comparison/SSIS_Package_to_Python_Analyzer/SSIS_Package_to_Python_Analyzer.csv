Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SSIS to Python conversion analyses with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (88/100). SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Basic offers concise analysis while SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Comprehensive provides more detailed explanations and better formatting. Both demonstrate strong correctness with minor formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Both outputs address identical conversion goals with same core topics: package overview, complexity metrics, conversion challenges, manual adjustments, complexity scoring, optimization techniques, framework recommendations, and execution model differences. Minor differences in emphasis and detail level (Basic: 40/100 complexity vs Comprehensive: 75/100 complexity score) but same fundamental understanding and approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Nearly identical 9-section structure (1. Package Overview through 9. apiCost). Same logical flow and topic ordering. Comprehensive version adds subsections and better formatting (markdown headers, detailed tables) but maintains same decomposition approach. Basic uses simple numbered list while Comprehensive uses hierarchical markdown structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Basic,95,Lines 15-25,"Well-formed content with consistent formatting. Minor issues: complexity metrics table could have better alignment (line 15-25), and some abbreviations lack expansion. All internal references are consistent and no syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Comprehensive,98,Lines 20-40,"Excellent formatting with proper markdown syntax, well-structured tables, and consistent internal references. Minor issue with potential markdown table formatting in complexity metrics section (lines 20-40) but overall highly polished and syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Basic,,Lines 30-35,"Consider expanding complexity metrics table formatting and providing more detailed explanations for conversion challenges. Add subsection headers for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Analyzer_Comprehensive,,Lines 45-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider minor table formatting improvements in complexity metrics section. Overall structure and detail level are exemplary for conversion planning."
