Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive SSIS to Python conversion analyses with similar structural approaches and semantic alignment. Agent 1 delivers a concise technical assessment while Agent 2 provides more detailed business context and expanded technical coverage. Key differences include presentation style, level of detail, and specific scoring methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: SSIS package analysis for Python conversion. They cover the same 9 main topics with consistent logical flow. Minor differences in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses on technical metrics while Agent 2 emphasizes business objectives and detailed explanations. Both reach similar conclusions about complexity and recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both follow identical 9-section numbered structure (Package Overview through apiCost). Agent 2 uses more detailed subsections with markdown formatting and structured tables. Agent 1 uses simpler formatting with embedded tables. Control flow and information hierarchy are nearly identical despite presentation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Well-structured content with consistent formatting. Minor issue: complexity score stated as 40/100 in line 20 but context suggests higher complexity given the challenges described."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2,98,Lines 1-50,"Excellent formatting with proper markdown syntax, consistent internal references, and well-structured tables. All sections are complete and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Average of individual scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_1,N/A,Lines 20-25,"Consider aligning complexity scoring with detailed challenge analysis. The 40/100 score seems inconsistent with the extensive challenges and manual adjustments described."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding more specific quantitative metrics in complexity assessment to complement the detailed qualitative analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide valuable SSIS to Python conversion guidance. Agent 2's detailed approach with business context is preferable for stakeholder communication, while Agent 1's concise format works well for technical implementation teams."
