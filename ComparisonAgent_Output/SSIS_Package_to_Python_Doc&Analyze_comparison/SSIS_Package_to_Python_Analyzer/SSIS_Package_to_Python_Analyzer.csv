Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents successfully analyzed the SSIS Package to Python conversion task with comprehensive coverage of all required sections. Agent 1 provided a concise analysis with complexity score 40/100, while Agent 2 delivered more detailed analysis with complexity score 75/100. Key differences include depth of business context, conversion challenge identification, and cost estimation. Both outputs maintain consistent structure and provide actionable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing SSIS to Python conversion complexity, identifying challenges, and providing recommendations. Agent 1 focuses on technical metrics (7 components, 40/100 complexity), while Agent 2 emphasizes business context and detailed analysis (15 components, 75/100 complexity). Both cover the same 9 sections with similar intent but different emphasis on business objectives vs technical details. Minor divergence in complexity scoring methodology and cost estimation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-50,"Nearly identical structural organization with both outputs following the exact same 9-section framework: Package Overview, Complexity Metrics, Conversion Challenges, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, Python Framework Recommendations, Execution Model Differences, and API Cost. Both use numbered sections, tabular metrics presentation, and bullet-point recommendations. Only minor differences in subsection organization within sections 1 and 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid table structure, consistent numbering, and accurate metric calculations. Minor issue: API cost shows 0.00 USD which may indicate incomplete cost tracking. All technical references are accurate and internal consistency is maintained throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-50,"Fully syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, comprehensive table structures, consistent section numbering, accurate metric calculations, and complete cost tracking (0.0080 USD). All internal references are consistent, technical details are accurate, and formatting is professional throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,Lines 1-50,"Average correctness score of 99/100. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic accuracy with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical content. Agent 2 shows slightly better completeness in cost tracking and detail comprehensiveness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 20-25,"Strengthen business context discussion and provide more detailed conversion challenge analysis. Consider expanding the complexity scoring rationale and ensure complete API cost tracking. The technical recommendations are solid but could benefit from more implementation-specific guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with strong business context and detailed technical coverage. Consider streamlining some sections to improve readability while maintaining depth. The complexity scoring and cost tracking are exemplary and should be maintained as the standard approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide valuable SSIS to Python conversion analysis with complementary strengths. Agent_1 offers concise technical focus while Agent_2 provides comprehensive business-technical integration. For future analyses, combine Agent_1's efficiency with Agent_2's thoroughness for optimal results. Both demonstrate strong understanding of conversion challenges and provide actionable Python framework recommendations."
