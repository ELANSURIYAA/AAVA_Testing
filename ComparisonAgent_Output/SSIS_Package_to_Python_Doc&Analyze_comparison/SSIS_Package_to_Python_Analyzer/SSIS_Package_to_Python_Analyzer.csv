Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS-to-Python conversion for an Employee Data Warehouse package. The first output offers a concise, metrics-focused approach while the second provides extensive detail and business context. Both reach similar conclusions about complexity and conversion strategies, with the second output demonstrating superior depth and professional presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing SSIS package conversion complexity. They share identical understanding of the conversion challenges, similar complexity scoring rationale, and consistent framework recommendations. Key alignment includes: package purpose identification, component counting methodology, conversion challenge categorization, and Python framework selection. Minor divergence in emphasis - first output focuses on technical metrics while second emphasizes business objectives and detailed explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-9 (structure comparison)","Both outputs follow nearly identical 9-section structure: Package Overview, Complexity Metrics, Conversion Challenges, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, Python Framework Recommendations, Execution Model Differences, and apiCost. The second output enhances this structure with professional formatting, subsections, and detailed tables. Structural differences include: second output uses markdown formatting with headers and tables, provides more granular subsections, and includes business objective context missing from the first."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Syntax is clean and well-formed. Minor issues: complexity score of 40/100 appears low given the detailed challenges described. Component count of 7 seems conservative compared to the comprehensive feature list provided. All technical terminology is accurate and references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,"Lines 25-30, 45-50","Excellent syntax and formatting with proper markdown structure. Comprehensive tables are well-formatted. Minor issue: complexity score of 75/100 is more realistic but could benefit from clearer justification methodology. All technical details are accurate and professional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper structure, accurate technical terminology, and consistent internal references. The second output shows superior formatting and presentation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Strengthen complexity scoring justification and consider expanding component analysis to match the comprehensive challenge description provided."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding more specific quantitative metrics for complexity scoring methodology to enhance reproducibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable SSIS conversion insights. The second output's detailed approach and professional formatting make it more suitable for stakeholder communication, while the first output's concise format works well for technical quick reference."
