Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS to Python conversion with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (88/100). Agent_1 delivers a concise, metrics-focused approach while Agent_2 provides extensive business context and detailed explanations. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy and syntactic correctness (100/100 each). The overall assessment score is 93/100, indicating excellent alignment with minor stylistic differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: SSIS package analysis for Python conversion. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Package purpose and ETL functionality (lines 1-5 both agents), (2) Complexity metrics and component counts (lines 6-15 both agents), (3) Conversion challenges identification (lines 16-25 both agents), (4) Manual adjustment strategies (lines 26-35 both agents), (5) Framework recommendations (lines 36-45 both agents). Minor semantic differences: Agent_2 provides more business context and detailed explanations, while Agent_1 focuses on technical metrics. Both reach similar conclusions on complexity scoring and optimization approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both agents follow nearly identical structural decomposition: 9 numbered sections with consistent logical flow. Structural alignments: (1) Package Overview → Business Objectives mapping, (2) Complexity Metrics tables with similar categories, (3) Conversion Challenges → Manual Adjustments → Complexity Scoring sequence, (4) Optimization → Framework Recommendations → Execution Models progression. Structural differences: Agent_1 uses simple numbered list format (lines 1-50), Agent_2 employs detailed subsections with headers and formatting (lines 1-80). Agent_2 includes additional structural elements like business objectives section and more detailed metric breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All,"Agent_1 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness: (1) Consistent numbered section format throughout, (2) Properly formatted complexity metrics table with aligned columns, (3) No syntax errors in technical terminology or references, (4) Internal consistency in component counts and references, (5) Proper formatting of cost notation (0.00 USD), (6) No broken internal references or undefined terms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All,"Agent_2 output shows excellent syntactic correctness: (1) Proper markdown-style formatting with headers and sections, (2) Well-structured tables with consistent alignment, (3) No syntax errors in technical content or business terminology, (4) Internal consistency across all sections and references, (5) Proper formatting of cost notation (0.0080 USD), (6) No broken internal references, consistent use of technical terms throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All,"Both agents demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Strengths: Concise and metrics-focused approach, clear complexity scoring methodology, efficient presentation of technical details. Recommendations: Consider adding business context and stakeholder impact analysis to enhance comprehensiveness and business alignment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-80,"Strengths: Comprehensive business context, detailed explanations, excellent formatting and structure, thorough coverage of all aspects. Recommendations: Consider condensing some sections for improved readability while maintaining the high level of detail and business focus."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent technical competency and alignment. For future iterations: (1) Combine Agent_1's concise metrics approach with Agent_2's business context, (2) Standardize formatting approaches for consistency, (3) Consider hybrid structure that balances detail with readability, (4) Maintain the high technical accuracy demonstrated by both agents."
