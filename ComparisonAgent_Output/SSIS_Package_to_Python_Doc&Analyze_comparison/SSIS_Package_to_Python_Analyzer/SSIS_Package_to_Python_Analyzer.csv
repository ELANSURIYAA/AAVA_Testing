Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-100 (Agent 2)","Both agents provide comprehensive SSIS to Python conversion analysis. Agent 2 delivers significantly more detailed analysis with enhanced business context, expanded complexity metrics, and deeper technical insights. Agent 1 provides concise but complete coverage of all required elements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-9 (Agent 1), Lines 1-9 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: SSIS package analysis for Python conversion. Both cover package overview, complexity metrics, conversion challenges, manual adjustments, complexity scoring, optimization techniques, framework recommendations, and execution model differences. Agent 2 provides enhanced business context and deeper technical analysis while maintaining semantic alignment with Agent 1's core intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-9 (Agent 1), Lines 1-9 (Agent 2)","Nearly identical structural organization with 9 numbered sections following the same logical flow. Both use tabular format for complexity metrics, bullet points for challenges and recommendations, and consistent section ordering. Agent 2 adds subsections and enhanced formatting but maintains the same fundamental structure as Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Analysis_Agent1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Minor formatting inconsistencies in complexity metrics table. Some technical details could be more specific (e.g., 'Lookups and dynamic expressions' could specify exact SSIS components). Overall syntactically correct with proper numbering and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Employee_Data_Warehouse_Analysis_Agent2,98,"Lines 25-30, 80-85","Excellent syntax and formatting throughout. Comprehensive technical details with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and well-organized subsections. Minor improvement opportunity in apiCost formatting consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
