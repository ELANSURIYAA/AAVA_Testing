Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not populated with actual content. To complete the comparison, please provide the actual outputs from both SSIS Package to Python analysis agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic similarity would assess how closely both outputs address SSIS to Python conversion goals and apply similar transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural similarity would examine the logical flow, decomposition approach, and organization of conversion steps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Analyzer_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Analyzer_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure outputs contain SSIS package analysis and Python conversion details. 3. Include line numbers for precise reference during comparison. 4. Verify outputs are complete and properly formatted before submission."
