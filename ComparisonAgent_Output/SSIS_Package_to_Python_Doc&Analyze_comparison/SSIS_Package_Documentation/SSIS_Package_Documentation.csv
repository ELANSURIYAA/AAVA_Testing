Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Two SSIS package documentation outputs with fundamentally different scopes and purposes. SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation focuses on logging functionality with embedded C# code, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation provides comprehensive ETL package documentation. Semantic alignment is limited due to different problem domains, but both demonstrate professional documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,35,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","Both documents address SSIS packages but serve different purposes. SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation (lines 1-50) focuses specifically on execution and error logging functionality, while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation (lines 1-100+) covers a complete employee data warehouse ETL process. The semantic overlap is limited to the shared SSIS context and logging components. Different business problems addressed: basic logging vs comprehensive data warehousing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Section headers 1-12 vs 1-13","Both follow similar documentation structures with numbered sections covering overview, structure, data flow, etc. SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation has 12 sections while Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation has 13 sections. Key structural differences: Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation includes detailed data mapping tables (section 4), complexity analysis with metrics (section 7), and API cost tracking (section 13). Both include code sections but Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation embeds it within comprehensive analysis rather than as primary focus."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation,95,"Lines 150-200","Documentation is well-structured and internally consistent. C# code syntax is valid with proper using statements, exception handling, and SSIS API usage. Minor issue: code shows two Main() methods which would cause compilation errors in same class (lines 150-170 and 171-200). Variable references and SSIS patterns are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation,98,"Lines 1-300+","Highly professional documentation with consistent internal references, proper table formatting, and comprehensive coverage. All section references are accurate, data volume figures are consistent throughout, and technical details align properly. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some table alignments but overall excellent quality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both documents demonstrate high quality with proper structure, accurate technical content, and professional presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation,,"Lines 150-200","Fix duplicate Main() method declarations in code section. Consider expanding documentation to include more comprehensive ETL context and business value proposition to match enterprise documentation standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation,,"Lines 250-300","Excellent comprehensive documentation. Minor suggestion to include actual code samples like the other document to provide concrete implementation examples alongside the theoretical framework."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Overall comparison","Documents serve different purposes effectively. Consider creating hybrid approach: comprehensive business and technical analysis from Employee_Data_Warehouse_Documentation combined with concrete code examples from SSIS_Package_Code_Documentation for optimal enterprise documentation."
