Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,N/A,"Two distinct SSIS package documentation outputs analyzed: SSIS_Package_Code focuses on execution and error logging functionality with embedded C# code examples, while Employee_Data_Warehouse provides comprehensive ETL documentation for employee data processing. Both are well-structured documentation but serve different purposes and scopes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,N/A,"Both outputs document SSIS packages but address fundamentally different business problems. SSIS_Package_Code (lines 1-12) focuses narrowly on logging mechanisms with technical implementation details, while Employee_Data_Warehouse (lines 1-13) provides enterprise-level ETL documentation for data warehousing. The semantic overlap is limited to shared SSIS concepts like error handling and logging, but the core purposes diverge significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both outputs follow structured documentation formats with numbered sections and clear hierarchies. SSIS_Package_Code uses 12 main sections (Overview, Structure, Data Flow, etc.) while Employee_Data_Warehouse uses 13 sections with similar organizational patterns. Both include technical elements, performance considerations, and deployment strategies. However, Employee_Data_Warehouse includes additional enterprise elements like data mapping tables and complexity analysis that SSIS_Package_Code lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Code,85,Lines 95-125,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and valid C# code examples. Minor issues include: (1) Line 95-96: C# code shows two separate Main() methods which would cause compilation conflicts in a single class, (2) Line 110: Uses AddWithValue which is not optimal for performance, but syntactically valid. Overall structure and technical content are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Employee_Data_Warehouse,92,Lines 45-65,"Highly structured and comprehensive documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues include: (1) Line 45-65: Data mapping table references specific data volumes (1TB, 200GB) without source validation, (2) Some assumptions about parallel processing capabilities without explicit configuration details. Technical content is accurate and well-organized throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,N/A,"Average correctness score of 88.5 rounded to 89. Both documents demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor implementation and assumption issues. Employee_Data_Warehouse shows slightly higher correctness due to more comprehensive validation of enterprise ETL concepts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_Code,,Lines 95-125,"Consolidate the two Main() methods into separate classes or methods to avoid compilation conflicts. Consider using SqlParameter with explicit data types instead of AddWithValue for better performance and type safety."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Employee_Data_Warehouse,,Lines 45-65,"Validate data volume assumptions with actual system specifications. Add explicit configuration details for parallel processing capabilities and provide more specific technical requirements for the infrastructure dependencies mentioned."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,N/A,"Both documents serve different audiences and purposes effectively. SSIS_Package_Code should expand scope to include broader ETL context, while Employee_Data_Warehouse could benefit from more concrete code examples like those in SSIS_Package_Code. Consider cross-referencing approaches for comprehensive SSIS documentation standards."
