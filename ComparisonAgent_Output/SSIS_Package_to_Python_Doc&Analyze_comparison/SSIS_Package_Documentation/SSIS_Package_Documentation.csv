Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SSIS package documentation but differ significantly in scope and detail. Output 1 focuses on basic execution and error logging functionality with 12 sections, while Output 2 presents enterprise-level Employee Data Warehouse ETL documentation with 13 sections and extensive technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-200","Both documents address SSIS package documentation but serve different purposes. Output 1 documents a simple logging package while Output 2 documents a complex data warehouse ETL process. They share common SSIS concepts (logging, error handling, variables) but diverge significantly in business context and technical complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Section headers 1-12 vs 1-13","Both follow similar documentation structures with numbered sections covering Overview, Structure, Data Flow, Mapping, Performance, etc. Output 2 includes additional sections (Complexity Analysis, Security/Compliance) and more detailed subsections. The logical flow and organization are comparable despite different content depth."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,92,"Lines 145-180","C# code syntax is valid with proper exception handling, StreamWriter usage, and SSIS variable access. Minor issue: hardcoded DTSExecResult values could use constants. SQL parameterization is correctly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,88,"Lines 85-95, 120-130","Documentation structure is sound with consistent formatting. Minor issues include some assumptions not fully validated (e.g., table sizes, execution times) and potential inconsistencies in complexity scoring methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (92 + 88) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,"Expand documentation scope to include more enterprise-level considerations like the complexity analysis and security sections found in Output 2. Add more detailed data mapping tables and performance optimization strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,"Validate quantitative assumptions (table sizes, execution times, complexity scores) with actual measurements. Consider adding concrete code examples like those in Output 1 to complement the comprehensive theoretical framework."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized documentation templates and consistent terminology. Consider merging the practical code focus of Output 1 with the comprehensive enterprise framework of Output 2 for optimal SSIS documentation."
