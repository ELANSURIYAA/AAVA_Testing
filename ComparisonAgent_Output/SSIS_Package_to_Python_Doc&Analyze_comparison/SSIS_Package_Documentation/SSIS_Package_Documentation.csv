Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Two comprehensive SSIS package documentation outputs with fundamentally different purposes and scope. Agent 1 focuses on a simple logging package with execution and error logging functionality, while Agent 2 presents a complex Employee Data Warehouse ETL package with extensive enterprise-level features. Both documents are well-structured but address entirely different business requirements and technical implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Agent 1: Lines 1-20, Agent 2: Lines 1-30","The outputs have minimal semantic overlap as they document completely different SSIS packages. Agent 1 covers a simple logging utility package focused on execution tracking and error capture, while Agent 2 documents a comprehensive ETL solution for employee data warehousing with complex transformations, multiple data sources, and business intelligence features. The only shared semantic elements are basic SSIS concepts like error handling and logging, but applied in vastly different contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Agent 1: Lines 1-150, Agent 2: Lines 1-400","Both documents follow structured documentation approaches but with different organizational philosophies. Agent 1 uses a 12-section format (Overview, Structure, Data Flow, etc.) while Agent 2 uses a 13-section format with additional enterprise-focused sections like Performance Optimization and Security. Both include code extraction/examples, but Agent 2 provides more detailed technical specifications, data mapping tables, and complexity analysis. The structural similarity exists in the high-level organization but diverges significantly in depth and enterprise focus."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,88,"Lines 130-150 (code section)","The documentation is internally consistent with proper section numbering, clear code examples, and logical flow. Minor issues include: incomplete error handling explanation in the code examples, and some assumptions about SSIS variable configuration that could be more explicit. The C# code syntax is correct and follows SSIS scripting patterns properly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 50-100 (data mapping table), Lines 200-250 (complexity analysis)","Highly detailed and internally consistent documentation with comprehensive technical specifications. Excellent use of structured tables for data mapping and complexity analysis. Minor formatting inconsistencies in the API cost section (appears twice with different formats). All technical references are accurate and the document maintains professional enterprise documentation standards throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 1-150","Consider expanding the documentation to include: (1) More detailed performance considerations for high-volume logging scenarios, (2) Security best practices for log file access and database connections, (3) Deployment and configuration guidance, (4) Integration patterns with enterprise monitoring systems, (5) Error recovery and retry mechanisms beyond basic exception handling."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 350-400","Excellent comprehensive documentation that serves as an enterprise-grade reference. Minor improvements could include: (1) Standardizing the API cost reporting format, (2) Adding specific version compatibility matrices for SQL Server/SSIS, (3) Including sample configuration files or deployment scripts, (4) Providing troubleshooting guides for common issues, (5) Adding performance benchmarks or SLA expectations for the ETL processes."
