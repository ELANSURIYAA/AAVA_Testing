Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a template or configuration issue where the actual agent outputs were not provided for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify that agent outputs are properly provided as input variables. 2. Ensure placeholder variables are replaced with actual content before running comparison analysis. 3. Re-run the comparison once valid agent outputs are available."
