# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as actual agent outputs were not provided. Input contained only placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of real content to analyze.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content.

### Correctness
- **Agent1**: Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 1 output content.
- **Agent2**: Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 2 output content.
- **Overall**: Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent assessments.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text to enable comprehensive comparison analysis. Ensure outputs contain the specific content that needs to be compared for semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation.
