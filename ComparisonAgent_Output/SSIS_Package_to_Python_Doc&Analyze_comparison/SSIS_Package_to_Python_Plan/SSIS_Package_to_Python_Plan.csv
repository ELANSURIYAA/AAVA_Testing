Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as actual agent outputs were not provided. Input contained only placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of real content to analyze."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."
