Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and testing effort analysis for SSIS to Python conversion. Agent 1 estimates $20.67 daily runtime cost with 40 hours total effort, while Agent 2 estimates $10.70 total runtime cost with 37 hours total effort. Key differences include resource requirements, cost calculation methodologies, and effort breakdown approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,All,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: Python runtime cost estimation and code fixing/testing effort estimation. Both provide detailed breakdowns of resource requirements, cost calculations, and testing phases. However, significant differences exist in cost calculation methodologies (Agent 1: $620 monthly vs Agent 2: $10.70 total), resource specifications (Agent 1: 32 cores/256GB vs Agent 2: 16 cores/64GB), and effort estimation approaches (Agent 1: 40 hours vs Agent 2: 37 hours). The semantic intent is aligned but execution differs substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical hierarchical structure with numbered sections (1. Cost Estimation, 1.1 Python Runtime Cost, 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation, 2.1-2.3 subsections). Both use bullet points for resource requirements and cost breakdowns. Agent 2 includes additional formatting with bold text and more detailed subsection organization. The logical flow and decomposition approach are highly similar, with minor variations in presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent1,95,All,"Output is syntactically correct with proper section numbering, consistent formatting, and valid calculations. All mathematical operations are accurate ($2.00/hour × 2 hours = $4.00, $500/30 = $16.67, etc.). Section references are consistent and all bullet points are properly formatted. Minor formatting inconsistency in some bullet point indentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent2,98,All,"Output is highly syntactically correct with excellent formatting, proper section numbering, and valid calculations. All mathematical operations are accurate ($1.60 × 3 = $4.80, $132/30 = $4.40, etc.). Consistent use of bold formatting for emphasis, proper bullet point structure, and clear section organization. Includes additional API cost section with proper formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid calculations, and consistent structure. Average score reflects minor formatting variations in Agent 1 while Agent 2 shows superior formatting consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent1,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Standardize cost calculation methodology to align with industry standards. Consider breaking down monthly costs into more granular daily/hourly components. Improve formatting consistency in bullet point indentation and section organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SSIS_Package_to_Python_Agent2,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Excellent structure and formatting. Consider adding more detailed justification for resource requirement estimates. The cost calculation methodology is more realistic and granular than Agent 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents should align on cost calculation methodologies and resource requirement specifications. Consider creating a standardized template for cost estimation reports. Agent 2's approach to formatting and structure should be adopted as the standard."
