Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a configuration issue where the input preprocessing step failed to substitute the placeholder variables with real agent outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires concrete content to analyze meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between the two agents' responses to the SSIS Package to Python conversion task."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires concrete content to analyze logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational structure between the two agents' responses."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content. Unable to validate code syntax, schema structure, or internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SSIS_Package_Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content. Unable to validate code syntax, schema structure, or internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated as individual agent outputs are not available for evaluation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify input preprocessing pipeline to ensure agent output variables are properly substituted before comparison. 2. Provide actual SSIS Package to Python conversion outputs from both agents for meaningful comparison. 3. Ensure template variable replacement mechanism is functioning correctly in the workflow. 4. Re-run comparison once actual agent outputs are available."
