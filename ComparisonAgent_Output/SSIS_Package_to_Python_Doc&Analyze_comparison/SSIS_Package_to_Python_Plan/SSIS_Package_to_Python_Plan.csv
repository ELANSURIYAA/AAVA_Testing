Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SSIS to Python conversion. Agent 1 provides more detailed resource specifications and higher cost estimates ($620 monthly vs $10.70 one-time), while Agent 2 offers more structured analysis with cloud-specific pricing. Both cover manual conversion effort (28-40 hours vs 21-37 hours) and validation testing with reasonable methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: Python runtime cost estimation, manual component conversion effort, and validation testing hours. However, they diverge significantly in cost calculation approaches - Agent 1 focuses on monthly operational costs while Agent 2 calculates per-execution costs. Both identify similar manual conversion components (script tasks, event handlers, expressions) but with different effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with three main sections: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation, and API Cost. Both use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) and similar subsection breakdowns. Agent 2 includes additional summary sections and more detailed reasoning explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Well-formatted documentation with proper structure and calculations. Minor issue: Storage cost calculation assumes full 5TB storage monthly when actual usage may be lower for batch processing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,N/A,"Excellent formatting with proper markdown structure, consistent calculations, and comprehensive coverage. All sections are well-organized with clear reasoning and proper cost breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 25-30,"Consider clarifying whether costs are per-execution or operational monthly costs. The $620 monthly estimate may be inflated for batch processing scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent structured approach. Consider adding more detail on resource scaling for different data volumes to match Agent 1's comprehensiveness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardizing cost calculation timeframes (per-execution vs monthly), 2) Including sensitivity analysis for different data volumes, 3) Adding risk factors for effort estimation accuracy."
