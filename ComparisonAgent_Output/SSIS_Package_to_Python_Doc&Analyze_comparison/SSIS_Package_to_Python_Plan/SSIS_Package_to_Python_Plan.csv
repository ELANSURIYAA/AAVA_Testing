Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual agent outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs to enable comprehensive comparison analysis. Ensure template variables are properly replaced with real content before running comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Verify that both agents are producing outputs in the expected format for SSIS Package to Python migration planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Once actual outputs are available, re-run this comparison to get meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness scores."
