Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for SSIS to Python migration. Agent_1 estimates $620 monthly cost with 40 hours effort, while Agent_2 estimates $10.70 runtime cost with 37 hours effort. Key differences include cost calculation methodology (monthly vs per-run), resource requirements (32 cores vs 16 cores), and effort breakdown granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: Python runtime cost estimation, manual component conversion effort, result validation effort, and total effort calculation. Both provide detailed breakdowns and reasoning. Differences lie in cost calculation approach (Agent_1 uses monthly recurring costs while Agent_2 uses per-execution costs) and specific resource assumptions, but overall intent and purpose are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structure: 1) Cost Estimation with Python Runtime Cost subsection, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with subsections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3) Both include detailed reasoning sections. Agent_2 adds an API cost section and 'Full Output' summary section, but core structure is highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,N/A,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, clear section numbering, and well-structured bullet points. Minor formatting inconsistency in the final reasoning paragraph structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 45-50,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting and structure. Minor issues include redundant 'Full Output' section that repeats previous content and inconsistent formatting in the final summary section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of Agent_1 (98) and Agent_2 (95). Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Consider clarifying whether cost estimates are per-execution or recurring monthly costs. Add API cost tracking for completeness. Improve consistency in formatting of reasoning sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 45-60,"Remove redundant 'Full Output' section that duplicates previous content. Standardize formatting in summary sections. Consider adding more detail on storage cost calculations for better transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost calculation methodology (per-execution vs monthly), 2) More detailed resource requirement justification, 3) Consistent effort estimation granularity, 4) Clear assumptions documentation for better reproducibility."
