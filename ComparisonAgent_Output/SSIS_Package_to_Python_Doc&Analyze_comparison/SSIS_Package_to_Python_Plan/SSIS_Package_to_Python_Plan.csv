Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two SSIS to Python cost estimation and effort analysis reports. Both outputs address the same core requirements but differ significantly in calculation methodology, cost estimates, and structural presentation. Agent 1 provides more detailed explanations while Agent 2 offers more structured formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs address identical requirements: Python runtime cost estimation, manual conversion effort, validation effort, and total effort calculation. However, they differ in cost calculation methodology (Agent 1: $620/month vs Agent 2: $10.70 single run), effort estimates (Agent 1: 40 hours vs Agent 2: 37 hours), and reasoning depth. Core intent is aligned but execution approaches vary significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: 1) Cost Estimation with Python Runtime Cost, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort with subsections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3) API Cost. Agent 1 uses more narrative format while Agent 2 employs bullet points and structured formatting. Section ordering and logical flow are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,Lines 15-20,"Minor formatting inconsistency in cost breakdown presentation. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper structure and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,N/A,"Well-structured with consistent formatting, proper bullet points, and clear section delineation. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor formatting variations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Improve cost calculation clarity by distinguishing between monthly recurring costs and single execution costs. Consider adding structured formatting similar to Agent 2 for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Enhance reasoning depth and provide more detailed explanations for cost calculations. Consider adding monthly cost projections for comprehensive planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents should align on cost calculation methodology (single execution vs monthly recurring) and provide both perspectives for complete analysis. Consider standardizing effort estimation granularity and validation approaches."
