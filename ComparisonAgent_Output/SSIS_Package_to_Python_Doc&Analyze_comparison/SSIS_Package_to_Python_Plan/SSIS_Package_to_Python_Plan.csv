Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 vs 1-95","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SSIS to Python migration. Output_1 focuses on detailed resource requirements with higher cost estimates ($620/month vs $10.70 one-time), while Output_2 provides more granular breakdown with realistic cloud pricing. Both cover manual conversion effort (28h vs 21h) and validation testing (12h vs 16h) with similar total effort estimates (40h vs 37h). Key differences include cost calculation methodology, resource sizing assumptions, and breakdown granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30, 45-70","Both outputs address identical goals: Python runtime cost estimation and testing effort analysis for SSIS migration. Core semantic alignment includes cost breakdown structure, effort categorization (manual conversion + validation), and similar reasoning patterns. Divergence occurs in cost calculation approach (monthly recurring vs one-time execution) and specific resource assumptions, but overall intent and purpose remain highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-15, 31-45, 71-85","Both follow similar hierarchical structure: 1. Cost Estimation (1.1 Python Runtime Cost), 2. Code Fixing and Testing (2.1-2.3 subsections). Output_1 uses more detailed resource specification and monthly cost modeling, while Output_2 employs cloud VM pricing with granular breakdowns. Control flow and logical decomposition are comparable, with minor variations in subsection organization and calculation presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,92,"Lines 8-12, 25-28","Syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting, proper bullet points, and clear mathematical calculations. Minor issues: some cost assumptions lack specific cloud provider references (line 8-12), and storage cost calculation methodology could be more explicit (line 25-28). Overall structure and internal consistency are strong."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,88,"Lines 15-18, 35-38, 78-82","Generally well-structured with proper formatting and clear calculations. Issues include: inconsistent formatting in some bullet points (lines 15-18), minor calculation presentation inconsistencies (lines 35-38), and some redundant content in the final summary section (lines 78-82). Mathematical calculations are accurate and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores (92 + 88)/2 = 90. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minor formatting and presentation issues that do not impact core functionality or readability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Lines 8-12, 20-25","Strengthen cost estimation by specifying exact cloud provider and instance types. Clarify whether $620/month represents ongoing operational costs or development environment costs. Add more granular breakdown of the 2-hour runtime assumption."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Lines 78-95","Remove redundant content in final summary section to improve clarity. Standardize bullet point formatting throughout the document. Consider adding comparison with SSIS operational costs for better context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 45-70","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized effort estimation methodology with clear assumptions, 2) Risk factors and contingency planning for effort estimates, 3) Validation criteria definition for the 16-hour data validation phase, 4) Integration testing considerations beyond unit testing scope."
