Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SSIS to Python migration. Agent_1 focuses on detailed resource requirements with higher cost estimates ($620/month vs $10.70 one-time), while Agent_2 provides more granular breakdown with API cost inclusion. Structural approaches differ significantly in organization and calculation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: Python runtime cost estimation and testing effort analysis. Agent_1 emphasizes monthly recurring costs and detailed resource specifications, while Agent_2 focuses on one-time execution costs with API integration. Both cover manual conversion effort and validation testing, but with different hour estimates (40 vs 37 hours total). The semantic intent is aligned but execution philosophy differs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both follow numbered section structure (1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing and Testing) but differ in subsection organization. Agent_1 uses deeper nesting (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) with detailed breakdowns, while Agent_2 includes additional API cost section and different effort categorization. Agent_1 has 85 lines vs Agent_2's 95 lines, showing different levels of detail and explanation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,Lines 15-20,"Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point structure. Resource calculations are mathematically sound. Storage cost calculation ($500/30 = $16.67) is correct. All numerical computations verify correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,Lines 25-30,"Some formatting inconsistencies in section headers and bullet points. Mathematical calculations are accurate. The VM cost calculation (3 hours × $1.60 = $4.80) is correct. API cost inclusion is properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting variations. Mathematical calculations are accurate in both cases. Internal references and structure are consistent within each output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Excellent detailed resource specification and monthly cost modeling. Consider adding one-time execution cost scenarios for better comparison with Agent_2 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Good granular cost breakdown with API cost inclusion. Consider adding monthly recurring cost analysis for long-term planning scenarios to match enterprise requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting consistency, 2) Hybrid cost model showing both one-time and recurring costs, 3) Risk factor analysis for cost estimates, 4) Performance benchmarking assumptions documentation."
