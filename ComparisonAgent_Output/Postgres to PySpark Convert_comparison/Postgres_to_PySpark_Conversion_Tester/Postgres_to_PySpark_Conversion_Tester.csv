Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs are comprehensive pytest test suites but address fundamentally different data processing scenarios. Agent 1 focuses on transaction/account aggregation with 7 test cases while Agent 2 covers PnP Daily ACH processing with 12 test cases. Both demonstrate solid testing practices with fixtures parameterized tests and edge case coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"","While both outputs are pytest test suites for data processing scenarios they address completely different business domains and use cases. Agent 1 tests transaction aggregation with filtering and joins while Agent 2 tests entity type classification and ACH processing. The semantic overlap is minimal - both are testing PySpark data processing but for entirely different purposes and business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case lists and pytest implementations. Both use pytest fixtures (lines 24-29 in Agent 1 lines 17-21 in Agent 2) helper functions for DataFrame creation and comprehensive test coverage. However Agent 1 uses JSON format for test case specification while Agent 2 uses markdown table format. Both implement similar testing patterns with setup execution and assertion phases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Line 45","Agent 1 pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports (lines 8-11) valid fixture definitions (lines 24-29) and well-formed test functions. Minor issue: line 45 uses how parameter in join which is correctly formatted. All test logic is sound and follows pytest conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 98 134","Agent 2 pytest script is mostly syntactically correct with proper imports and structure. Issues identified: line 98 has incorrect window function usage 'F.window.partitionBy' should be 'Window.partitionBy' requiring additional import. Line 134 uses undefined 'window_spec' variable. Otherwise test structure and logic are well-implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93.5,"","Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with minor syntax issues that would be caught in code review or testing phases."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"","Maintain the strong test structure and comprehensive coverage. Consider adding more edge cases for null handling and error scenarios. The JSON format for test case specification is clear and machine-readable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 98 134","Fix the window function syntax error on line 98 by importing Window from pyspark.sql.window and using Window.partitionBy. Address the undefined variable on line 134. Consider consolidating the test case format to be more consistent with the pytest implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs demonstrate excellent testing practices but serve different purposes. If these were meant to test the same functionality significant alignment would be needed. Consider standardizing test case documentation format and ensuring all syntax issues are resolved before deployment."
