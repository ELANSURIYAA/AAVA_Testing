Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Two distinct PySpark test suites addressing different business domains. PostgreSQL_to_PySpark focuses on transaction aggregation with 7 test cases, while PnP_Daily_ACH focuses on entity classification with 12 test cases. Both are well-structured but serve completely different purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-50, 201-250","Outputs address fundamentally different business problems. PostgreSQL_to_PySpark handles transaction aggregation, date filtering, and financial calculations. PnP_Daily_ACH handles customer entity classification with regex patterns and business rules. Same technical framework (PySpark/pytest) but completely different semantic intent and business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 51-100, 251-300","Both follow similar high-level structure: test case documentation table followed by pytest script implementation. Both use pytest fixtures, parameterized tests, and PySpark DataFrames. However, PostgreSQL_to_PySpark has 7 test cases while PnP_Daily_ACH has 12, and internal test organization differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PostgreSQL_to_PySpark,95,"Lines 101-150","Pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test implementations. Minor deduction for potential null handling edge cases in line 145 where null date filtering might need more explicit handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PnP_Daily_ACH,90,"Lines 301-400","Pytest script is syntactically correct but has more complex regex patterns and business logic that could benefit from additional validation. Lines 350-360 contain complex conditional logic that may need more robust error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5, rounded to 93"

Recommendations,Recommendation,PostgreSQL_to_PySpark,,"Lines 101-200","Consider adding more edge case testing for null date handling and improve error messages for failed aggregations. The test suite is solid but could benefit from boundary testing for extreme transaction amounts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PnP_Daily_ACH,,"Lines 301-450","Enhance regex pattern validation and add more comprehensive error handling for complex business rules. Consider breaking down the entity classification logic into smaller, more testable functions. Add performance testing for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","These outputs serve completely different business purposes and should not be directly compared for functional equivalence. Each is well-suited for its respective domain. Consider standardizing test case documentation format across different business domains for consistency."
