Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents address PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis but with significantly different approaches and depth. Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter provides a concise 6-point summary focusing on core conversion accuracy and optimization suggestions. Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer delivers a comprehensive review with detailed step-by-step analysis, extensive test cases, and production-ready pytest implementation. The outputs serve complementary purposes - one for quick assessment, the other for thorough validation and testing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-6 vs Lines 1-21","Both outputs address the same core task of PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis. Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter focuses on high-level conversion accuracy, discrepancies (missing ORDER BY), and optimization suggestions. Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer provides the same core insights but expands significantly with detailed step-by-step conversion analysis, comprehensive test case design, and production implementation guidance. Both identify key issues like missing ORDER BY clause and optimization needs, but Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer provides much deeper technical analysis and actionable testing framework."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-6 vs Lines 1-21 + test cases","Structural approaches differ significantly. Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter uses a simple 6-point numbered list structure (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations). Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer employs a comprehensive multi-section format with detailed subsections, systematic step-by-step analysis, tabulated test cases, and complete pytest implementation. While both follow logical progression from analysis to recommendations, the structural complexity and depth vary dramatically."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter,95,"Lines 1-6","Syntactically correct with proper numbered structure, clear language, and well-formed recommendations. All technical points are accurate including identification of missing ORDER BY clause and appropriate optimization suggestions. Minor deduction for brevity that could benefit from more specific technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer,98,"Lines 1-21 + test implementation","Highly correct with comprehensive technical analysis, proper markdown formatting, accurate step-by-step conversion mapping, and syntactically valid pytest implementation. All code examples, test cases, and technical recommendations are well-formed and production-ready. Minor deduction for assumption about external function availability without explicit validation steps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"","Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter,,"Lines 4-6","Suitable for quick conversion assessment and high-level validation. Provides essential insights for immediate optimization needs. Best used when rapid evaluation is required without extensive testing infrastructure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer,,"Lines 1-21 + test cases","Ideal for comprehensive production deployment with robust testing framework. Provides detailed validation methodology and complete test coverage. Essential for enterprise-grade implementations requiring thorough quality assurance and systematic validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Consider combining approaches: use Postgres_to_PySpark_Converter for initial rapid assessment, then leverage Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer's comprehensive framework for detailed validation and production deployment. The test cases and pytest implementation from Postgres_to_PySpark_Reviewer should be standard for any production PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion project."
