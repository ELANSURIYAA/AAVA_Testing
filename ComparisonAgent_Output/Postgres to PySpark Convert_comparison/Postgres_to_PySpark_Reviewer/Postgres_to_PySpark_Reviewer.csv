Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two comprehensive PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion reviews with identical structural approach but significantly different levels of detail. Agent 1 provides concise analysis across 6 key dimensions, while Agent 2 delivers extensive analysis with 12 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation. Both maintain consistent technical accuracy and logical flow, with Agent 2 offering superior depth and actionable testing framework."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-6 (Agent 1), Lines 1-21 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core task of PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis. Agent 1 provides concise 6-section review focusing on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization. Agent 2 maintains same semantic intent but expands significantly with comprehensive step-by-step comparison, detailed test case specifications, and complete pytest implementation. Key semantic alignment: both identify missing ORDER BY clause, recommend performance optimizations, and assess overall conversion fidelity. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses on high-level recommendations while Agent 2 provides granular implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-6 (Agent 1), Lines 1-21 (Agent 2)","Identical 6-section logical structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. Both follow systematic analytical flow from high-level summary to detailed technical assessment to actionable recommendations. Agent 2 extends structure with additional test case table (12 test cases) and complete pytest script (200+ lines) but maintains core organizational pattern. Section ordering and logical progression perfectly aligned between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 1-6","Well-formed analysis with consistent internal structure. All technical references accurate (PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause, PySpark DataFrame operations, JDBC configurations). Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point structure. No syntax errors or broken references. Cost reporting accurate ($0.0070). Recommendations technically sound and implementable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 1-21","Comprehensive, syntactically correct analysis with extensive technical detail. Pytest script contains valid Python syntax, proper imports, and executable test cases. Markdown formatting consistent throughout. All code examples properly formatted and syntactically valid. Test case table well-structured with clear ID, description, and expected outcome columns. No broken references or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with Agent 2 providing superior completeness and implementation detail."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance output with more detailed implementation guidance, specific line-by-line code examples, and comprehensive test case coverage to match industry standards for technical documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding executive summary section and cost breakdown analysis to improve accessibility for stakeholders requiring high-level overview alongside technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency. Agent 1 provides efficient concise analysis suitable for rapid assessment, while Agent 2 delivers production-ready comprehensive review with full testing framework. Recommend combining Agent 1's conciseness with Agent 2's depth for optimal stakeholder communication."
