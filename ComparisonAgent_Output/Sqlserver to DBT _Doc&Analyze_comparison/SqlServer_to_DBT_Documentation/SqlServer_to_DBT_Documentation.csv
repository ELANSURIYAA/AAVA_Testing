Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same SQL Server query that generates customer order summaries. The query uses CTEs to aggregate customer metrics from raw transactional data. Both documents follow enterprise documentation standards with similar section structures covering overview, code design, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Key differences include formatting style, specific technical details, and cost reporting mechanisms."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-300 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical business objectives: documenting a SQL query for customer order analytics. They cover the same core concepts including CTEs (customer_orders and order_summary), table relationships (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, ARRAY_AGG), and business value proposition. Minor semantic differences include Agent 1's emphasis on 'enterprise data warehousing alignment' vs Agent 2's focus on 'analytics workload' terminology. Both correctly identify the filtering condition (status = 'completed') and business benefits (customer retention, targeted promotions)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both outputs follow nearly identical 10-section documentation structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-10) while Agent 2 uses markdown headers with numbers. Both include similar subsection breakdowns within each major section. Main structural difference is Agent 2's inclusion of specific file identifier in title and API cost reporting at the end, while Agent 1 embeds cost information within the content block."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 45-50, 180-185","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper section numbering, consistent formatting, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in some bullet points and one instance of unclear reference to 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' (line 47) which appears to be a formatting artifact. All SQL concepts, table names, and technical details are accurately presented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,"Lines 25-30, 200-205","Agent 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent header hierarchy, and clean technical presentation. Very minor issue with repeated 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' terminology (lines 28, 205) which may be intentional branding but creates slight readability inconsistency. All technical content is accurately formatted and referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, accurate technical terminology, and consistent internal formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting artifacts in both outputs but overall excellent technical accuracy and presentation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Standardize spacing and bullet point formatting throughout document. Clarify or remove the 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' reference artifact. Consider adding more specific performance benchmarks and execution time estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain consistent terminology usage, particularly around 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' references. Consider adding cost breakdown details similar to Agent 1's approach. The file identifier in title is helpful for traceability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs represent high-quality enterprise documentation. Consider establishing unified formatting standards for future documentation projects. Both could benefit from including actual SQL code snippets for reference and adding specific performance metrics or SLA requirements."
