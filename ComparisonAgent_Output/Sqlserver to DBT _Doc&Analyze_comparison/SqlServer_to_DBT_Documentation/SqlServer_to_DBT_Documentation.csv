Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-500,"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL Server documentation for customer order analysis queries. Agent1_SQLServer_Doc provided a structured 10-section format covering overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT delivered similar content with slight variations in formatting and some additional technical details like API costs. Both documents address the same business problem of customer order analytics and follow enterprise data warehousing best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-500,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: generating customer order summaries from raw transactional data. They describe the same SQL components (CTEs, joins, aggregations), same tables (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), and same business benefits (customer segmentation, targeted marketing). Minor differences in emphasis on specific technical details like API costs (Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT lines 480-485) and complexity scoring methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-500,"Both documents follow similar 10-section structures: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. Agent1_SQLServer_Doc uses more bullet points and structured formatting, while Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT uses more narrative descriptions. Both maintain logical flow from high-level overview to technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_SQLServer_Doc,95,1-250,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper section numbering, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point alignment (lines 45-50) and one instance of incomplete sentence structure in performance section (line 180)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT,97,1-485,"Highly accurate documentation with consistent formatting, proper markdown syntax, and complete technical descriptions. Includes additional metadata like API costs and file identifiers. Minor issue with inconsistent header formatting in section 7 (line 320)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both documents demonstrate high technical accuracy and proper documentation standards with minimal syntax or formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_SQLServer_Doc,,45-50;180,"Improve bullet point formatting consistency and complete incomplete sentences in performance optimization section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT,,320,"Standardize header formatting in complexity analysis section for better visual consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-500,"Both documents provide excellent SQL Server documentation. Consider standardizing on a single formatting approach for future consistency. Agent2_SQL_TO_DBT's inclusion of API cost metadata could be valuable for enterprise cost tracking."
