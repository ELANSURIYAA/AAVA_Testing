Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL Server documentation with similar scope and depth. Agent 1 provides a more structured enterprise-focused approach with explicit business alignment sections, while Agent 2 offers more technical depth with specific complexity scoring. Both cover the same core SQL components (CTEs, joins, aggregations) and business objectives (customer analytics). Key differences lie in presentation format and emphasis on different aspects of the analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 45-55","Both outputs address the same core objective of documenting SQL Server customer order analysis code. They share identical understanding of business purpose (customer insights, analytics), data sources (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), and technical components (CTEs, aggregations). Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on enterprise alignment while Agent 2 emphasizes technical complexity scoring."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-5, 20-30, 40-50","Both follow similar documentation structure with overview, code analysis, data flow, and technical sections. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-10) with consistent formatting, while Agent 2 uses markdown headers with more granular subsections. Agent 1 has explicit 'Assumptions and Dependencies' and 'Key Outputs' sections that Agent 2 integrates into other sections. Both maintain logical flow from overview to technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 8, 15, 22","Well-formed documentation with consistent structure. Minor issues: Line 8 mentions 'ARRAY_AGG' which may not be standard SQL Server syntax (more common in PostgreSQL), Line 15 references views as 'None explicitly mentioned' but should clarify if applicable, Line 22 could be more specific about index recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 12, 25, 35","Generally well-structured with good markdown formatting. Issues: Line 12 references 'SQL_TO_DBT.txt__ebz1ar4l' which appears to be a system-generated identifier rather than meaningful documentation, Line 25 mentions 'ARRAY_AGG' compatibility with SQL Server 2017+ which needs verification, Line 35 complexity score of 35/100 lacks detailed justification methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor syntax and reference issues. Average correctness score reflects high quality documentation with room for improvement in technical precision and reference accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Verify ARRAY_AGG syntax compatibility with SQL Server versions. Add more specific index recommendations with column names. Clarify view usage applicability in enterprise context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Replace system-generated identifiers with meaningful documentation titles. Provide detailed methodology for complexity scoring. Verify technical claims about SQL Server feature compatibility with specific version requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents should standardize on SQL Server-specific syntax examples. Consider adding performance benchmarking data. Include more specific error handling examples for production environments. Enhance cross-referencing between sections for better navigation."
