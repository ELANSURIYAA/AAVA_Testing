Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive SQL Server documentation for customer order analysis queries. The first output uses a structured numbered approach (1-10 sections) while the second uses markdown formatting. Both cover identical core topics including overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Key differences lie in presentation style and organizational approach rather than content substance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same SQL Server query documentation task with nearly identical semantic intent. Both identify the purpose as customer order analysis, mention the same tables (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), describe identical CTEs (customer_orders, order_summary), and cover the same business problem of customer insights. Minor semantic differences include Agent 1's emphasis on 'enterprise data warehousing alignment' (line 8) while Agent 2 focuses on 'analytics workload' (line 15). Both conclude with similar complexity assessments and business benefits."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Significant structural differences exist despite similar content coverage. Agent 1 uses a rigid 10-section numbered structure (#### 1. Overview, #### 2. Code Structure, etc.) while Agent 2 employs markdown headers with different hierarchy (## 1. Overview, **Purpose:**, etc.). Agent 1 presents information in paragraph form under each section, while Agent 2 uses more bullet points and sub-headers. Both follow logical flow from overview to technical details to conclusions, but Agent 2 includes additional formatting elements like horizontal rules (---) and better visual separation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45, 78, 120","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and accurate technical references. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in some sections (line 45) and one instance of unclear table reference formatting (line 78). All SQL terminology is used correctly, and technical details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 25, 180","Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, consistent header hierarchy, and clean structure. Very minor formatting inconsistency in one bullet point (line 25) and slight spacing issue near the end (line 180). All technical content is accurate and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with only minor formatting issues that don't affect readability or technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Consider adopting more visual formatting elements like horizontal rules and bullet points to improve readability. The numbered section approach is solid but could benefit from better visual hierarchy within sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Maintain the excellent markdown formatting and visual structure. Consider adding more detailed sub-section organization similar to Agent 1's approach for complex technical topics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting conventions for technical terms, 2) More consistent spacing and indentation, 3) Addition of code examples or snippets to illustrate concepts, 4) Cross-references between related sections to improve navigation."
