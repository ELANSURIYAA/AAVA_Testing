Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent1_SQLServer_Doc and Agent2_SQLServer_Doc provide comprehensive documentation for SQL Server customer order analysis queries. Agent1_SQLServer_Doc presents content in a structured format with clear numbered sections, while Agent2_SQLServer_Doc uses markdown formatting with better visual hierarchy. Both cover identical technical concepts including CTEs, joins, aggregations, and performance optimization. The semantic alignment is very high as both address the same business problem and technical implementation. Structural differences exist primarily in formatting and organization approach, but logical flow remains consistent. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper SQL Server terminology and concepts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-200,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: generating customer order summaries from raw transactional data. Core concepts are aligned including customer analytics (lines 15-20 in both), revenue optimization (lines 25-30), and data warehousing principles (lines 10-15). Technical terminology is consistent across both outputs with proper use of SQL Server concepts like CTEs, joins, and aggregations. Minor semantic differences include Agent2_SQLServer_Doc's more explicit mention of SQL Server 2017+ requirements (line 180) and slightly different emphasis on business benefits (lines 20-25). Both correctly identify the same source tables, transformations, and output structure."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,1-200,"Structural organization differs significantly between outputs. Agent1_SQLServer_Doc uses numbered sections (1-10) with consistent subsection formatting, while Agent2_SQLServer_Doc employs markdown headers with hierarchical organization. Both follow similar logical progression: Overview → Structure → Data Flow → Mapping → Performance → Technical Elements → Complexity → Dependencies → Outputs → Error Handling. Agent1_SQLServer_Doc provides more granular subsections within each major section (lines 50-100), while Agent2_SQLServer_Doc uses cleaner markdown formatting with better visual separation (lines 60-120). Content ordering is nearly identical, but presentation methodology creates structural variance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_SQLServer_Doc,95,1-200,"Agent1_SQLServer_Doc demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper section numbering, consistent formatting, and accurate technical terminology. All SQL Server concepts are correctly referenced including CTEs (lines 45-50), aggregation functions (lines 80-85), and indexing strategies (lines 120-125). Minor formatting inconsistencies include inconsistent bullet point usage (lines 70-75) and some repetitive phrasing in performance sections (lines 130-135). Technical accuracy is excellent with correct identification of SQL Server components and proper business logic descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_SQLServer_Doc,98,1-200,"Agent2_SQLServer_Doc exhibits excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent header hierarchy, and accurate technical content. All markdown syntax is properly formatted including headers (lines 1, 20, 40), code blocks, and lists. Technical terminology is precise and accurate throughout, with correct SQL Server version requirements (line 180), proper CTE descriptions (lines 60-65), and accurate complexity scoring (line 195). Minor issues include one inconsistent spacing in the API cost section (line 200) but overall formatting and content accuracy is exceptional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy and proper formatting within their respective presentation styles."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_SQLServer_Doc,N/A,70-75,"Improve formatting consistency by standardizing bullet point usage and reducing repetitive content in performance optimization sections. Consider adopting markdown formatting for better readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_SQLServer_Doc,N/A,200,"Address minor spacing inconsistency in API cost section. Consider adding more granular subsections within major sections to match the detailed breakdown approach of Agent1_SQLServer_Doc."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Including actual SQL code examples alongside documentation, 2) Adding specific performance benchmarks and metrics, 3) Providing more detailed error handling examples, 4) Including visual diagrams for data flow representation, 5) Adding version control and change management sections for enterprise deployment considerations."
