Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Input contains template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that have not been replaced with actual agent outputs. No content available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables present instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables present instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no content provided, only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no content provided, only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score unavailable due to missing agent outputs"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Replace template variables with actual agent outputs before running comparison. 2. Ensure both agent outputs are provided in the expected format. 3. Verify that content is properly escaped and formatted for analysis. 4. Re-run the comparison once actual outputs are available."
