Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-30 (Agent 2)","Both outputs are comprehensive technical documentation following similar structural patterns. Agent 1 documents an SSIS ETL package for billing account dimension loading, while Agent 2 documents a SQL Server customer order summary query. Both serve their respective documentation purposes effectively but address entirely different technical domains and business contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-10 (both)","While both outputs are technical documentation, they address fundamentally different purposes. Agent 1 focuses on ETL package documentation for data warehousing operations, while Agent 2 documents analytical query logic. The semantic intent diverges significantly - one is operational ETL documentation, the other is query analysis documentation. Both fulfill documentation goals but for completely different technical artifacts and business contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-40 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow very similar documentation structures with numbered sections, clear headings, and logical flow. Agent 1 uses: Overview → Design → Data Flow → Mapping → Outputs. Agent 2 uses: Overview → Structure → Data Flow → Mapping → Performance → Outputs. Both include business context, technical details, and structured data mapping tables. The organizational approach and section decomposition are remarkably similar despite different subject matter."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount,95,"Lines 85-120","The SSIS documentation is syntactically well-formed with consistent terminology, proper technical references, and accurate SSIS component naming. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in the data mapping table and occasional verbose descriptions that could be more concise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_TO_DBT,98,"Lines 1-200","The SQL Server query documentation is highly accurate with proper SQL syntax references, correct technical terminology, and well-structured content. Very minor formatting variations in section numbering but overall excellent internal consistency and technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of both individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount,,"Lines 85-120","Consider standardizing data mapping table formatting and reducing verbose descriptions in some sections. The technical content is solid but could benefit from more concise presentation in certain areas."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_TO_DBT,,"Lines 1-200","Excellent documentation overall. Minor suggestion to standardize section numbering format consistently throughout the document. The technical accuracy and structure are exemplary."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","While both documents excel in their respective domains, they serve completely different purposes and cannot be meaningfully compared for business alignment. Each should be evaluated against domain-specific documentation standards rather than cross-domain comparison."
