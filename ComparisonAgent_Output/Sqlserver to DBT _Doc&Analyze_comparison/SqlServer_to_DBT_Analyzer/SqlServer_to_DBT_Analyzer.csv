Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. The input contained placeholder text '{{agent 1_string_true}}' and '{{agent 2_string_true}}' instead of actual agent outputs to compare. A proper comparison requires the actual content from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic similarity analysis requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of both outputs to determine if they address the same goals and apply similar reasoning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural similarity analysis requires examining the logical structure, flow, and decomposition approach of both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Analyzer_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Analyzer_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform a proper comparison analysis: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text, 2) Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted, 3) Include any relevant context or requirements for the SQL Server to DBT analysis task, 4) Verify that both agents received the same input prompt for fair comparison."
