Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-30 vs 1-32,"Both agents provide comprehensive SQL script analysis covering the same 7 core sections. SQL_Server_DBT_Agent delivers superior depth with 95% semantic alignment, identical structural approach, and includes the complete SQL script implementation. SQL_Analysis_Agent provides solid foundational analysis but lacks the actual code implementation and detailed business context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-5 vs 1-8, Lines 25-30 vs 25-32","Both agents demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in analyzing SQL script purpose, complexity, and optimization strategies. Minor differences in business objective articulation (SQL_Server_DBT_Agent includes customer segmentation focus on lines 6-8) and API cost variation ($0.0035 vs $0.0024). Core analytical intent and conclusions are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-30 vs 1-32","Virtually identical structural organization with same 7-section framework: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Calculation. SQL_Server_DBT_Agent adds 2 additional lines in overview section and includes complete SQL implementation at end, but maintains identical logical flow and decomposition approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analysis_Agent,88,"Lines 15-20, Line 25","Generally well-formed analysis with accurate technical details. Minor issues: ARRAY_AGG replacement suggestion on line 17 could be more specific about SQL Server version compatibility. Complexity score of 50/100 on line 25 appears slightly high compared to actual query complexity described."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Server_DBT_Agent,96,"Lines 20-25, Lines 32-60","Highly accurate and comprehensive analysis with proper SQL Server syntax validation. Correctly identifies ARRAY_AGG version compatibility (SQL Server 2017+) on lines 22-23. Includes complete, syntactically valid SQL script implementation. Minor deduction for complexity score of 35/100 which could be better justified given the aggregation complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score reflects strong technical accuracy across both outputs with proper syntax validation and comprehensive coverage of SQL analysis requirements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analysis_Agent,,Lines 15-20,"Enhance analysis depth by including actual SQL script implementation and more specific version compatibility guidance for SQL Server functions. Provide more detailed business context and customer segmentation insights."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Server_DBT_Agent,,Lines 1-60,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider providing more detailed justification for complexity scoring methodology and include additional edge case handling recommendations for large dataset scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 25-30,"Both agents provide valuable SQL analysis with strong technical accuracy. SQL_Server_DBT_Agent offers superior completeness with actual implementation, while SQL_Analysis_Agent provides solid foundational analysis suitable for initial assessment phases."
