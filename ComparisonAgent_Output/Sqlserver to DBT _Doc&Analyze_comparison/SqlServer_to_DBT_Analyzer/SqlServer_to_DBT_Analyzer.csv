Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive SQL analysis reports for the same customer order summarization script. Basic_SQL_Analyzer delivers a concise 30-line analysis focusing on fundamental metrics and optimization. SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer provides a more detailed 32-line analysis with SQL Server-specific considerations, business objectives, and enhanced technical depth. Key differences include business context depth, SQL Server version compatibility notes, and optimization specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs analyze the identical SQL script with the same core purpose: customer order summarization with aggregated metrics. Both identify the same database objects (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products) and similar analytical goals. SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer provides enhanced business context with actionable insights and customer segmentation focus (lines 6-8), while Basic_SQL_Analyzer focuses purely on technical aggregation (lines 3-4). Both recognize the same filtering logic and aggregation patterns, but SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer offers more comprehensive business interpretation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Calculation. The logical flow and section decomposition are highly consistent. Minor structural differences include SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer adding 'Primary Business Objectives' subsection (lines 6-8) and more detailed subsection organization within Syntax Analysis (lines 24-32). Both use similar analytical frameworks and present information in comparable hierarchical structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Basic_SQL_Analyzer,95,15-16,"Analysis is syntactically correct and internally consistent. Minor technical inaccuracy: states 30 lines when actual script appears to be 32 lines. All database object references are accurate, aggregation function counts are correct, and optimization recommendations are technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer,98,13,"Analysis is highly accurate and internally consistent. Correctly identifies 32 lines, provides accurate SQL Server version compatibility notes (line 32), and includes comprehensive technical details. Minor consideration: ARRAY_AGG availability in SQL Server 2017+ is correctly noted but could specify alternative functions more explicitly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper SQL analysis methodology. SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer shows slightly higher precision in technical details and version-specific considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Basic_SQL_Analyzer,N/A,All,"Enhance business context documentation and add SQL Server version-specific compatibility notes. Include more detailed business objectives and use case scenarios to match enterprise analysis standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer,N/A,All,"Maintain current comprehensive approach. Consider adding more explicit alternative function suggestions for older SQL Server versions. Could benefit from including estimated performance impact metrics for optimization recommendations."
