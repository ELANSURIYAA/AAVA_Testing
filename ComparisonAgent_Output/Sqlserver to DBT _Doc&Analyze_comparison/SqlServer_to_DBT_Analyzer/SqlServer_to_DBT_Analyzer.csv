Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive SQL analysis reports for customer order summary scripts. Agent_1 delivers a structured 30-line analysis covering script overview, complexity metrics, syntax analysis, and optimization recommendations with a complexity score of 50/100. Agent_2 provides a more detailed 32-line analysis with enhanced business context, complete SQL code inclusion, and a lower complexity score of 35/100. Both agents identify the same core database objects (4 tables, 2 CTEs, 3 INNER JOINs) and similar optimization strategies, though Agent_2 offers more granular technical insights and SQL Server-specific considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both agents demonstrate strong semantic alignment in analyzing the same SQL customer order summary script. They identify identical core purposes: aggregating customer behavior data including total orders, spending, and product categories. Both recognize the same 4 tables (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), 2 CTEs (customer_orders, order_summary), and 3 INNER JOINs. Key business objectives align: customer insights, spending analysis, and segmentation support. Minor semantic differences include Agent_1's focus on general optimization (line 25-30) versus Agent_2's SQL Server-specific recommendations (lines 45-60). Agent_2 provides more detailed business context and actionable insights terminology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both agents follow highly similar analytical structures with 7 main sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Calculation. Agent_1 uses a more concise bullet-point format throughout, while Agent_2 employs detailed subsections with enhanced formatting. Structural differences include: Agent_2 adds 'Primary Business Objectives' subsection (lines 8-11), includes complete SQL code block (lines 95-120), and provides more granular optimization categories. Both maintain logical flow from overview to technical analysis to recommendations, though Agent_2's structure is more comprehensive and detailed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,25-30,"Agent_1 analysis is syntactically correct with proper formatting and consistent terminology. Minor issues: Line 25 mentions 'indexed views' without SQL Server version context, and line 30 suggests replacing ARRAY_AGG without specifying SQL Server compatibility requirements. All technical metrics are accurate: 30 lines, 4 tables, 3 joins, 2 CTEs correctly identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,45-50,"Agent_2 analysis demonstrates superior technical accuracy with SQL Server-specific considerations. Correctly identifies ARRAY_AGG compatibility (SQL Server 2017+) at line 45, provides accurate syntax alternatives, and includes complete working SQL code (lines 95-120). Minor formatting inconsistency in section numbering. All metrics accurately reported: 32 lines, 4 tables, 3 joins, 2 CTEs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both agents demonstrate high correctness levels with accurate technical analysis and proper formatting. Agent_2 shows slightly superior technical precision with SQL Server-specific insights and complete code inclusion."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Enhance analysis with SQL Server version-specific considerations and include complete SQL code examples for better technical accuracy and practical utility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Maintain current comprehensive approach while ensuring consistent section formatting. Consider adding more comparative analysis with other SQL dialects for broader applicability."
