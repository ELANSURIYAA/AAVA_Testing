Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents produced comprehensive SQL script analysis reports with similar structural approaches. Agent 2 provides more detailed technical analysis with specific SQL Server optimizations, while Agent 1 offers a more generalized approach. Both cover the same core areas: script overview, complexity metrics, syntax analysis, manual adjustments, complexity scoring, optimization techniques, and API cost calculation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same fundamental goal of analyzing a SQL script that generates customer order summaries. They both identify the same key database objects (raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products), same number of joins (3), and same CTEs (customer_orders, order_summary). However, Agent 2 provides more SQL Server-specific insights and business context, while Agent 1 takes a more database-agnostic approach. The core intent and understanding are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 7 main sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Calculation. Agent 2 includes additional subsections and more detailed breakdowns within each section, but the overall flow and logical decomposition are remarkably similar. Both use consistent formatting and hierarchical organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Analysis_Agent_1,95,,"Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, and accurate technical details. Minor issue: Line 15 mentions 30 lines for the script but Agent 2 reports 32 lines, suggesting a potential counting discrepancy. All other technical metrics and analysis appear accurate and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_TO_DBT_Agent_2,98,,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive technical analysis, proper markdown formatting, and detailed SQL script inclusion. The analysis is thorough and technically accurate with specific SQL Server version considerations. Very minor formatting inconsistency in the complete SQL script section placement, but overall extremely well-structured and accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical content. Average score reflects minor discrepancies in line counting and formatting details."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Analysis_Agent_1,,,"Consider adding more database-specific optimizations and business context to enhance practical applicability. Include actual SQL script examples for better clarity and validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_TO_DBT_Agent_2,,,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing the complexity scoring methodology and ensuring consistency in technical metrics reporting across different analysis contexts."
