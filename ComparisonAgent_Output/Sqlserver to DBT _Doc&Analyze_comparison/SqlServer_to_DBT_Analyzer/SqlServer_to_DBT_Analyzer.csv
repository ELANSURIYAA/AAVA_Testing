Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as actual agent outputs were not provided. Received placeholder text '{{agent 1_string_true}}' and '{{agent 2_string_true}}' instead of actual content. A proper comparison requires the actual outputs from both agents to evaluate semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder content does not contain meaningful information for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder content does not contain meaningful structural elements for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Analyzer_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Analyzer_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform a proper comparison analysis: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text, 2) Ensure outputs contain the complete content to be analyzed, 3) Specify the type of outputs (code, documentation, analysis reports, test cases) for appropriate evaluation criteria, 4) Include any specific requirements or context for the comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Once actual outputs are provided, the analysis will include: detailed semantic similarity evaluation, structural comparison with line-by-line analysis, syntax and correctness validation, and comprehensive scoring with specific justifications and line references."
