Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent1), Lines 1-80 (Agent2)","Both agents produced comprehensive SQL analysis reports for customer order summary scripts. Agent1 provided a structured 7-section analysis covering script overview, complexity metrics, syntax analysis, manual adjustments, complexity scoring (50/100), optimization techniques, and API cost ($0.0035). Agent2 followed an identical structure but with enhanced detail, including specific business objectives, lower complexity score (35/100), more granular optimization recommendations, different API cost ($0.0024), and inclusion of the complete SQL script. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency in SQL analysis with consistent methodology and professional formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10 (both agents)","Both agents correctly identify the same core purpose: generating customer order summaries from raw datasets. They reference identical database objects (4 tables: raw.orders, raw.users, raw.order_items, raw.products) and similar aggregation functions. However, Agent2 provides more detailed business context with specific objectives like 'targeted marketing and customer segmentation' (lines 8-10), while Agent1 focuses more on technical functionality. The complexity scoring differs significantly (Agent1: 50/100 vs Agent2: 35/100 at lines 25-26), suggesting different interpretation criteria. Both identify the same optimization areas but Agent2 provides more granular recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50 (Agent1), Lines 1-80 (Agent2)","Both outputs follow nearly identical 7-section structures: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Calculation. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Agent2 adds an 8th section with the complete SQL script (lines 60-80) and includes more detailed subsections within existing sections (e.g., 'Primary Business Objectives' in Script Overview). The overall decomposition approach and information hierarchy are remarkably similar, indicating consistent analytical frameworks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,98,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Agent1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and valid technical content. Minor issue: the complexity score rationale could be more detailed (line 25). All technical specifications are accurate, including table names, function counts, and optimization recommendations. No broken references or formatting errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,99,"Lines 60-80","Agent2 output is syntactically correct with comprehensive formatting and detailed technical accuracy. Includes complete, valid SQL script with proper syntax (lines 60-80). All internal references are consistent, technical specifications are accurate, and the analysis demonstrates deep SQL Server knowledge. No syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores (98 + 99) / 2 = 98.5. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and valid technical content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 20-25, 35-45","Agent1 provides solid technical analysis but could enhance business context and include the actual SQL script for completeness. The complexity scoring rationale should be more detailed to justify the 50/100 score. Consider adding more specific optimization recommendations similar to Agent2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 8-10, 45-55, 60-80","Agent2 delivers comprehensive analysis with excellent business context integration and complete SQL script inclusion. The detailed optimization recommendations and lower complexity score (35/100) appear more accurate for the given script complexity. This output serves as a strong reference standard for SQL analysis reporting."
