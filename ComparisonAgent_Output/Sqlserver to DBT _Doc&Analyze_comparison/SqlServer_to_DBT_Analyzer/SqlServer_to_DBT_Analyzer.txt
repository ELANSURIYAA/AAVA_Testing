# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive SQL analysis reports for the same customer order summarization script. **Basic_SQL_Analyzer** delivers a concise 30-line analysis focusing on fundamental metrics and optimization. **SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer** provides a more detailed 32-line analysis with SQL Server-specific considerations, business objectives, and enhanced technical depth. Key differences include business context depth, SQL Server version compatibility notes, and optimization specificity.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs analyze the identical SQL script with the same core purpose: customer order summarization with aggregated metrics. Both identify the same database objects (`raw.orders`, `raw.users`, `raw.order_items`, `raw.products`) and similar analytical goals. **SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer** provides enhanced business context with actionable insights and customer segmentation focus (lines 6-8), while **Basic_SQL_Analyzer** focuses purely on technical aggregation (lines 3-4). Both recognize the same filtering logic and aggregation patterns, but **SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer** offers more comprehensive business interpretation.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Calculation. The logical flow and section decomposition are highly consistent. Minor structural differences include **SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer** adding 'Primary Business Objectives' subsection (lines 6-8) and more detailed subsection organization within Syntax Analysis (lines 24-32). Both use similar analytical frameworks and present information in comparable hierarchical structures.

### Correctness

**Basic_SQL_Analyzer (Score: 95/100)**: Analysis is syntactically correct and internally consistent. Minor technical inaccuracy: states 30 lines when actual script appears to be 32 lines (lines 15-16). All database object references are accurate, aggregation function counts are correct, and optimization recommendations are technically sound.

**SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer (Score: 98/100)**: Analysis is highly accurate and internally consistent. Correctly identifies 32 lines, provides accurate SQL Server version compatibility notes (line 32), and includes comprehensive technical details. Minor consideration: ARRAY_AGG availability in SQL Server 2017+ is correctly noted but could specify alternative functions more explicitly (line 13).

**Overall Correctness (Score: 97/100)**: Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper SQL analysis methodology. **SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer** shows slightly higher precision in technical details and version-specific considerations.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Basic_SQL_Analyzer | SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer | Overall |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 92 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **90** | **93** | **91** |

## Recommendations

**For Basic_SQL_Analyzer**: Enhance business context documentation and add SQL Server version-specific compatibility notes. Include more detailed business objectives and use case scenarios to match enterprise analysis standards.

**For SQL_Server_DBT_Analyzer**: Maintain current comprehensive approach. Consider adding more explicit alternative function suggestions for older SQL Server versions. Could benefit from including estimated performance impact metrics for optimization recommendations.
