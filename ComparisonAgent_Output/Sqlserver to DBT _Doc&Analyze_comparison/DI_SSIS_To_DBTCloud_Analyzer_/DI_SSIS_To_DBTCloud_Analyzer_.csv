Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-95 vs 1-89,"Two distinct technical analysis reports with different scopes and objectives. Migration_Analysis_Report provides comprehensive SSIS-to-DBT migration analysis with structured metrics and recommendations. SQL_Query_Analysis focuses on SQL Server query optimization with complexity scoring. Both demonstrate technical competency but address fundamentally different analytical domains."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,Lines 1-10 vs 1-10,"Both outputs are technical analysis reports but serve completely different purposes. Migration_Analysis_Report analyzes SSIS package migration feasibility (lines 1-10: 'EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount.dtsx...extract transform and load billing account data'). SQL_Query_Analysis examines SQL query optimization (lines 1-10: 'SQL Server query generates summary report of customer orders'). Minimal semantic overlap beyond being technical analyses."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,Lines 1-95 vs 1-89,"Both follow structured analytical frameworks but with different organizational patterns. Migration_Analysis_Report uses 8-section format (Overview, Component Metrics, Conversion Feasibility, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Architecture Recommendation, Optimization Strategies, Cost). SQL_Query_Analysis uses 7-section format (Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Score, Optimization Techniques, API Cost). Similar analytical depth but different structural emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Migration_Analysis_Report,92,Lines 15-25 and 85-95,"Well-structured technical analysis with comprehensive SSIS component mapping. Minor formatting inconsistencies in table structure (lines 15-25) and some redundant phrasing in optimization strategies (lines 85-95). All technical content appears accurate and properly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Query_Analysis,88,Lines 30-40 and 75-89,"Solid technical analysis with accurate SQL syntax evaluation. Minor issues include incomplete index recommendation details (lines 30-40) and some repetitive optimization suggestions (lines 75-89). SQL script formatting and complexity scoring appear correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minor presentation and detail issues. Average correctness score reflects strong analytical foundation with room for refinement in formatting and specificity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Migration_Analysis_Report,,Lines 85-95,"Enhance table formatting consistency and reduce redundancy in optimization strategies section. Consider adding more specific timeline estimates for migration complexity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SQL_Query_Analysis,,Lines 75-89,"Provide more detailed index specifications and consolidate overlapping optimization recommendations. Consider adding performance benchmarking estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized formatting templates and more quantitative metrics where applicable. Consider cross-referencing related analytical frameworks for consistency."
