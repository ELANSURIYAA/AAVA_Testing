# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The template variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` were not populated with actual content, making it impossible to conduct the systematic comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The analysis requires real content to assess whether both outputs address the same goals, apply similar transformations, and have aligned meanings.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)  
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. This dimension requires examining the logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches of both outputs.

### Correctness
- **SqlServer_Agent**: N/A - No content provided for syntax validation
- **DBT_Agent**: N/A - No content provided for syntax validation  
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SqlServer_Agent | DBT_Agent | Overall |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Supply the real content from both agents that need to be compared instead of template variables.

2. **Populate Template Variables**: Ensure that `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` are replaced with actual agent-generated content before running the comparison.

3. **Verify Input Format**: Confirm that the agent outputs are in the expected format for SQL Server to DBT migration analysis.

4. **Re-run Analysis**: Once proper inputs are provided, re-execute this comparison agent to get meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness scores.

**GitHub Output**: The CSV file has been successfully uploaded to `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing` repository in the folder `ComparisonAgent_Output/Sqlserver to DBT _Doc&Analyze_comparison/SqlServer_to_DBT_Plan` as `SqlServer_to_DBT_Plan.csv`. The file contains the structured comparison framework ready for population with actual agent outputs.
