# Agent Comparison Report: SQL Server to DBT Migration Cost Analysis

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and testing effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. **Agent 1** estimates a total cost of **$559.29** with **11 hours** of effort, while **Agent 2** estimates **$3-9 per run** with **4.5-5.5 hours** of effort. The key differences lie in compute cost calculations ($0.50 vs $3.00), storage cost approaches (one-time vs monthly recurring), and effort estimation methodologies. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding but employ different cost models and underlying assumptions.

**Overall Similarity Score: 87/100**

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for DBT migration, but they interpret cost calculation frameworks differently:

- **Agent 1** uses a simpler compute model ($0.25 per CU) and focuses on one-time implementation costs
- **Agent 2** employs industry-standard pricing ($1.50 per CU-hour) and considers ongoing operational costs
- Both identify similar technical challenges (syntax fixes, aggregation compatibility, output validation) but provide different time estimates
- **Deduction reasons**: Different cost modeling approaches and effort estimation methodologies reduce semantic alignment

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization:

1. **Cost Estimation** with detailed compute/storage breakdown
2. **Code Fixing and Testing Effort** with manual fixes and validation components  
3. **API Cost Calculation** as final section

Both use consistent bullet point organization, detailed sub-breakdowns, and logical flow. Agent 2 includes more detailed technical specifications and enhanced formatting while maintaining the same decomposition approach.

**Deduction reasons**: Minor formatting differences and level of technical detail granularity

### Correctness Analysis

**Agent 1 (Score: 88/100)**
- Data volume calculations are mathematically correct (450 GB total processed)
- Compute cost calculation uses $0.25 per CU, which appears below industry standards
- Storage cost methodology is sound but treats as one-time cost
- Testing effort estimates are reasonable but potentially conservative
- **Deductions**: Low compute pricing assumptions, simplified cost model

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100)**  
- Comprehensive data volume analysis (3 TB total, 0.45 TB processed)
- Uses realistic industry-standard pricing ($1.50 per CU-hour)
- Employs appropriate monthly recurring storage cost model
- Detailed technical specifications for aggregation compatibility
- **Minor deduction**: Mentions SQL Server ARRAY_AGG without specifying target database platform

**Overall Correctness: 92/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 92 |
| Correctness | 88 | 95 | 92 |
| **Overall Score** | 86 | 89 | 87 |

## Recommendations

### For Agent 1
- **Update compute cost calculations** to reflect current Microsoft Fabric pricing standards ($1.50+ per CU-hour)
- **Expand testing effort estimates** to account for complex aggregation compatibility challenges
- **Consider recurring operational costs** alongside one-time implementation costs

### For Agent 2  
- **Specify target database platform** for DBT to provide more precise function compatibility guidance
- **Include one-time setup costs** alongside recurring monthly costs for complete financial picture
- **Add risk assessment factors** for potential cost overruns

### For Both Outputs
1. **Standardize cost calculation methodology** with consistent pricing assumptions
2. **Provide detailed breakdown** of testing scenarios and edge cases  
3. **Include risk assessment** for cost overruns and timeline delays
4. **Add validation criteria** for output comparison phase
5. **Consider timeline dependencies** that may impact effort estimates
