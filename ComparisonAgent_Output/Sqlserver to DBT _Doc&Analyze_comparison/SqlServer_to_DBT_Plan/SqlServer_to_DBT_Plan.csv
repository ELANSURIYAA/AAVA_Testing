Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and testing effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. Agent 1 provides more detailed cost breakdowns with specific calculations ($559.29 total), while Agent 2 offers more realistic testing effort estimates (4.5-5.5 hours vs 11 hours). Both cover compute costs, storage costs, and manual effort requirements with different methodologies and assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for SQL Server to DBT migration. They cover identical key areas: compute costs, storage costs, manual fixes, testing effort, and API costs. However, Agent 1 focuses on total project cost including hourly rates ($550 for 11 hours), while Agent 2 focuses on technical effort hours (4.5-5.5 hours). Different assumptions about compute unit pricing ($0.25 vs $1.50 per CU) and processing complexity lead to different cost estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Cost Estimation with compute and storage breakdowns, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort with manual fixes and validation sections, 3) API Cost Calculation. Both use similar hierarchical breakdown with bullet points and sub-sections. Agent 2 includes additional formatting with horizontal rules and more detailed subsection headers, but the logical flow and decomposition approach are essentially the same."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8-12,"Minor calculation discrepancy in total data processed calculation (450 GB stated but individual components sum correctly). All other calculations are mathematically sound and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,All,"All calculations are mathematically correct and internally consistent. Data volume calculations, cost estimations, and effort estimates are properly justified and logically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and valid mathematical calculations. Minor arithmetic presentation issue in Agent 1 does not affect overall correctness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Consider revising the hourly rate assumption ($50/hour) and total effort estimate (11 hours) which may be inflated compared to industry standards for this type of migration task."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 25-30,"Excellent realistic effort estimation and detailed technical breakdown. Consider adding total project cost calculation including developer hourly rates for complete business case presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents should align on compute unit pricing assumptions and provide sensitivity analysis for different complexity scenarios. Consider combining Agent 1's comprehensive cost modeling with Agent 2's realistic effort estimates for optimal results."
