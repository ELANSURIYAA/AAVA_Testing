Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and testing effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. Agent 1 estimates total cost at $559.29 with 11 hours effort, while Agent 2 estimates $3-9 per run with 4.5-5.5 hours effort. Key differences include compute cost calculations ($0.50 vs $3.00), storage approaches (one-time vs monthly), and effort estimation methodologies. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding but use different cost models and assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for DBT migration. However, they interpret cost calculation differently - Agent 1 uses a simpler compute model ($0.25 per CU) while Agent 2 uses industry standard ($1.50 per CU-hour). Agent 1 focuses on one-time costs while Agent 2 considers ongoing monthly storage costs. Both identify similar technical challenges (syntax fixes, aggregation compatibility, output validation) but with different time estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structure: 1) Cost Estimation with compute/storage breakdown, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort with manual fixes and validation, 3) API Cost Calculation. Both use similar section headers, bullet point organization, and detailed sub-breakdowns. Agent 2 includes more detailed technical specifications and formatting but maintains the same logical flow and decomposition approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,15-25,"Agent 1 has minor calculation inconsistencies. Line 15-17: Data volume calculations are correct (450 GB total). Line 20-21: Compute cost calculation uses $0.25 per CU which seems low compared to industry standards. Line 25: Storage cost calculation methodology is sound. Line 35-45: Testing effort estimates are reasonable but may be conservative for complex transformations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,10-30,"Agent 2 demonstrates high technical accuracy. Line 10-15: Data volume calculations are detailed and correct (3 TB total, 0.45 TB processed). Line 20-25: Uses industry-standard pricing ($1.50 per CU-hour) with realistic runtime estimates. Line 30-35: Storage cost approach (monthly recurring) is more realistic for enterprise scenarios. Minor issue: Line 40 mentions SQL Server ARRAY_AGG compatibility without specifying target database."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,All,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with proper calculation methodologies and realistic effort estimates. Agent 2 shows slightly higher accuracy in cost modeling and technical specifications."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,20-25,"Consider updating compute cost calculations to reflect current industry pricing standards. The $0.25 per CU rate appears low compared to typical Microsoft Fabric pricing. Expand testing effort estimates to account for complex aggregation compatibility issues."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,40-45,"Specify target database platform for DBT to provide more precise function compatibility guidance. Consider adding one-time setup costs alongside recurring monthly costs for complete cost picture."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost calculation methodology, 2) More detailed breakdown of testing scenarios and edge cases, 3) Risk assessment for cost overruns, 4) Timeline considerations for effort estimates, 5) Validation criteria for output comparison phase."
