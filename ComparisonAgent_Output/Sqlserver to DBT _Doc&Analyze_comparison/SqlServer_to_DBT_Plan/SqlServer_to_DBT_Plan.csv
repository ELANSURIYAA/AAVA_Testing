Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-75,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. Output1 estimates total cost at $559.29 with 11 hours effort, while Output2 estimates $3-9 per run with 4.5-5.5 hours effort. Key differences include cost calculation methodologies, technical depth, and effort estimation approaches. Output2 demonstrates superior technical understanding of DBT-specific considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-75,"Both outputs address the same core objective of cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. They cover identical main sections: cost estimation, code fixing effort, and API costs. However, Output1 focuses on total project cost ($559.29) while Output2 emphasizes per-run operational costs ($3-9). Output1 calculates 450GB processed data vs Output2's 0.45TB (same value, different units). Both identify similar technical challenges but with different emphasis on DBT-specific considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-75,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with three main sections: 1) Cost Estimation, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation, 3) API Cost Calculation. Both use hierarchical breakdown with subsections for compute costs, storage costs, manual fixes, and validation efforts. Output2 includes additional technical detail sections and uses more consistent formatting with clear section separators. Both conclude with summary cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,92,Lines 8-15,"Minor calculation inconsistency: states 15% of total data processed but calculates individual percentages that don't align perfectly (225+30+75+120=450GB vs stated 15% of 3TB=450GB - calculation is correct but presentation could be clearer). All other calculations are mathematically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,95,Lines 20-25,"Very minor unit inconsistency: mentions 0.45TB and 450GB interchangeably but calculations are correct. Technical details about DBT functionality are accurate. All cost calculations are mathematically sound and well-justified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,Lines 1-75,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate calculations. Minor presentation issues in Output1 and minimal unit notation inconsistencies in Output2 prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,N/A,Lines 35-50,"Improve calculation presentation clarity and provide more DBT-specific technical considerations. Consider breaking down the $550 testing cost calculation methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,N/A,Lines 55-70,"Maintain the superior technical depth while adding more concrete total project cost estimates. Consider reconciling per-run vs total project cost perspectives."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-75,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost calculation methodologies, 2) Clear distinction between per-run operational costs vs total project costs, 3) More detailed risk assessment for cost overruns, 4) Validation of technical assumptions with actual DBT environment specifications."
