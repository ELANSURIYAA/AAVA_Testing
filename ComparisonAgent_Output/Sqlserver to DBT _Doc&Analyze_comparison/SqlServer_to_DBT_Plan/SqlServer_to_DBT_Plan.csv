Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for SQL Server to DBT migration. Agent_1 focuses on detailed data volume calculations with specific storage costs while Agent_2 provides more structured compute cost analysis with Microsoft Fabric pricing. Both outputs are technically sound with minor differences in approach and cost assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for SQL Server to DBT migration. They cover identical sections: cost estimation code fixing effort and API costs. The semantic intent is highly aligned with both providing compute costs storage costs data volume analysis and manual effort estimates. Minor differences exist in cost calculation methodologies and specific pricing assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with three main sections. Both use numbered sections (1 2 3) and similar subsection hierarchies. Agent_1 uses more bullet-point formatting while Agent_2 uses more descriptive headers but the logical flow and decomposition approach are essentially the same."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8-15,"Minor calculation inconsistency: Total data processed calculation shows 450 GB but individual components (225+30+75+120) sum to 450 GB correctly. Storage cost calculation uses correct formula. All syntax and mathematical operations are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 20-25,"Highly accurate calculations and consistent data references. Minor formatting inconsistency in data volume presentation (mixing TB and GB units) but all conversions are mathematically correct. All technical specifications are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper calculations consistent data references and valid cost estimation methodologies. Minor formatting and presentation differences do not impact correctness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Strengthen cost calculation transparency by showing intermediate steps more clearly. Consider standardizing unit representations (GB vs TB) for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-35,"Excellent structured approach. Consider adding more detailed breakdown of the 15% data processing assumption and its justification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable migration analysis. Consider harmonizing cost calculation methodologies and adding confidence intervals for effort estimates. Both could benefit from including risk factors and mitigation strategies in cost planning."
