Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 1-80","Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation analyses for SQL Server to DBT conversion with similar semantic intent but different pricing models and effort estimates. Agent_1 uses $0.25/CU pricing while Agent_2 uses $1.50/CU. Both identify 450GB data processing volume and similar technical complexity factors."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 1-80","Both outputs address identical goals: cost estimation for DBT SQL conversion, manual effort estimation, and API cost reporting. Core concepts align well including compute units, data volume processing (450GB), and complexity factors. Minor divergence in cost models and effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 1-80","Nearly identical structural organization with three main sections: 1) Cost Estimation with compute/storage breakdown, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort, 3) API Cost Calculation. Both use hierarchical bullet points and similar subsection decomposition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-25, 35-40","Syntactically well-formed with consistent mathematical calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in currency notation ($0.50 vs $8.79). All numerical computations are internally consistent and properly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 20-30, 45-55","Excellent syntax and internal consistency. Proper formatting throughout, clear mathematical expressions, and well-structured bullet points. Range estimates (4.5-5.5 hours) are appropriately expressed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"All lines","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent calculations, and clear structure. Agent_2 slightly more polished in presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,85,"Lines 35-45","Standardize currency formatting and consider providing range estimates for effort calculations to account for uncertainty."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,90,"Lines 40-60","Excellent approach with range estimates. Consider adding more detailed breakdown of the $1.50/CU pricing assumption and its source."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,87,"All sections","Both agents should align on pricing models for consistency. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_1's detailed calculations with Agent_2's range-based uncertainty modeling."
