Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100+,"Two distinct analysis documents: Agent 1 provides SSIS to DBT Cloud migration planning with 30 hours development effort and $30/month runtime costs, while Agent 2 analyzes DBT SQL query costs with 4.5-5.5 hours effort and $3/run costs. Both are well-structured cost/effort analyses but address different scopes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,35,Lines 1-50,"Limited semantic overlap. Agent 1 focuses on comprehensive SSIS-to-DBT migration planning including transformation of specific SSIS components (Lookup, Conditional Split, Event Handlers), while Agent 2 analyzes runtime costs and fixing effort for a specific DBT-compatible SQL query. Both address cost estimation and effort analysis but for fundamentally different use cases and scopes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-100+,"Strong structural alignment with both following similar organizational patterns: numbered sections for cost estimation, effort estimation, and API costs. Both provide detailed breakdowns with calculations, assumptions, and justifications. Agent 1 uses subsections (1.1, 1.2, 2.1) while Agent 2 uses bold headers, but overall flow and decomposition approach are highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan,95,Lines 15-20,"Minor formatting inconsistency with spacing around mathematical operations (e.g., '8 (Lookup) + 6 (Conditional Split)' could be more consistently formatted), but all calculations are correct, references are valid, and internal structure is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis,98,Lines 25-30,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid calculations, and consistent internal references. Minor issue with currency formatting inconsistency ($1.50 vs $3.00) but overall very well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"High overall correctness with both outputs demonstrating strong syntactic validity and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan,N/A,Lines 10-25,"Strengthen formatting consistency in mathematical expressions and consider adding more detailed assumptions for cloud cost calculations. The migration plan is comprehensive but could benefit from risk assessment sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis,N/A,Lines 20-35,"Excellent technical analysis with clear cost breakdowns. Consider standardizing currency formatting and adding more detail on data partitioning impact on costs. The effort estimation methodology is sound."
