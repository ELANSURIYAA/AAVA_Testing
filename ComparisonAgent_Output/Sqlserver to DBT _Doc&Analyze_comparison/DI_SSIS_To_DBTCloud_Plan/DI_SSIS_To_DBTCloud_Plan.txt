# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two distinct analysis documents were compared: **DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan** provides comprehensive SSIS to DBT Cloud migration planning with 30 hours development effort and $30/month runtime costs, while **DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis** analyzes DBT SQL query costs with 4.5-5.5 hours effort and $3/run costs. Both are well-structured cost/effort analyses but address fundamentally different scopes and use cases.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 35/100)

**Limited semantic overlap identified.** While both outputs address cost estimation and effort analysis, they serve fundamentally different purposes:

- **DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan** focuses on comprehensive migration planning, including transformation of specific SSIS components (Lookup Transformation, Conditional Split, Event Handlers, Precedence Constraints)
- **DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis** analyzes runtime costs and fixing effort for a specific DBT-compatible SQL query with joins and aggregations

The low semantic similarity score reflects that these are essentially different types of analysis documents addressing different phases of a data engineering workflow.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

**Strong structural alignment observed.** Both outputs follow highly similar organizational patterns:

- Numbered sections for cost estimation and effort estimation
- Detailed breakdowns with calculations, assumptions, and justifications  
- API cost reporting as final section
- Consistent use of bullet points and sub-categorization

**Minor structural differences:**
- DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan uses formal subsections (1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis uses bold headers for section breaks
- Both maintain logical flow and professional document structure

### Correctness

**DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan (Score: 95/100)**
- Excellent overall correctness with valid calculations and consistent internal references
- Minor formatting inconsistency noted in mathematical expressions (Lines 15-20: spacing around operations like '8 (Lookup) + 6 (Conditional Split)')
- All component effort estimates and cost calculations are mathematically sound

**DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis (Score: 98/100)**
- Outstanding syntactic correctness with proper formatting throughout
- Valid calculations for compute costs, storage costs, and effort estimates
- Minor currency formatting inconsistency ($1.50 vs $3.00) but does not impact readability

**Overall Correctness (Score: 97/100)**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan | DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis | Overall |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Semantic Similarity** | - | - | 35 |
| **Structural Similarity** | - | - | 78 |
| **Correctness** | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | 76 | 79 | 78 |

## Recommendations

### For DI_SSIS_To_DBTCloud_Plan
- **Formatting Enhancement:** Strengthen consistency in mathematical expressions and spacing
- **Risk Assessment:** Consider adding risk assessment sections for migration planning
- **Cost Assumptions:** Provide more detailed assumptions for cloud cost calculations, particularly around warehouse sizing and frequency variations

### For DBT_SQL_Query_Analysis  
- **Formatting Standardization:** Standardize currency formatting throughout the document
- **Technical Detail:** Add more detail on data partitioning impact on costs
- **Methodology:** The effort estimation methodology is sound and well-justified
