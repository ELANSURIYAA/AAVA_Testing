# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison analysis could not be completed due to missing agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual agent outputs required for evaluation.

**Overall Assessment**: Unable to perform semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation without substantive content from both agents.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale**: Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The provided input contains only placeholder variables rather than real content that could be analyzed for meaning, intent, and purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale**: Cannot assess structural similarity including logical flow, decomposition approach, or organizational patterns without access to actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables provide no structural information for comparison.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation (placeholder `{{agent 1_string_true}}` provided)
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation (placeholder `{{agent 2_string_true}}` provided)
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Cannot compute average correctness without individual agent evaluations

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace placeholder variables with substantive content from both agents to enable meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Verify Input Format**: Ensure agent outputs contain the expected content type (code, documentation, analysis reports, or test cases) with sufficient detail for evaluation.

3. **Content Validation**: Before initiating comparison, verify that both agent outputs are complete, properly formatted, and contain analyzable content.

4. **Rerun Analysis**: Once actual agent outputs are provided, rerun the comparison process to obtain valid semantic, structural, and correctness scores.
