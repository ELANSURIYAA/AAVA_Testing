# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison could not be completed due to missing agent outputs. The input contained template placeholders (`{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}`) instead of actual agent outputs to compare.

**Overall Score**: 0/100 (No comparison possible)

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The provided input contains template variables rather than substantive content to analyze for meaning, intent, and purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No logical structure, flow, or decomposition can be assessed when template placeholders are provided instead of real content.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - No output provided for syntax validation
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - No output provided for syntax validation  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Cannot calculate average without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace template placeholders with real agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison and scoring.

2. **Verify Input Completeness**: Ensure agent outputs contain the actual content to be compared rather than variable placeholders.

3. **Validate Comparison Prerequisites**: Confirm that the comparison task includes complete and valid agent outputs before initiating the comparison process.

## GitHub Output Status
