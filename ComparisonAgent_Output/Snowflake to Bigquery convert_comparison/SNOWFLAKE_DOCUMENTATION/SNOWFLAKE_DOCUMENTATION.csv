Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"This comparison evaluates two fundamentally different outputs: FileNotFound (error message) vs SnowflakeDoc (comprehensive documentation). Agent FileNotFound produced a file not found error message, while Agent SnowflakeDoc delivered extensive technical documentation analyzing a Snowflake SQL program. The outputs represent completely different response types - error handling vs successful analysis - making direct comparison challenging but revealing significant differences in capability and output quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,1 vs 1-500+,"The semantic similarity is extremely low. FileNotFound (line 1) communicates a file access error with no analytical content, while SnowflakeDoc (lines 1-500+) provides comprehensive technical analysis including program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. The outputs address entirely different semantic domains - error reporting vs technical documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,1 vs 1-500+,"Structural similarity is minimal. FileNotFound has a single-line error message structure, while SnowflakeDoc follows a detailed 11-section analytical framework with subsections, tables, and systematic organization. The only structural commonality is that both are text-based responses, but their organizational approaches are fundamentally different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileNotFound,100,1,"FileNotFound output is syntactically correct as an error message. The message clearly states the issue (file not found) and requests verification of file location, which is appropriate error handling syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SnowflakeDoc,95,Multiple,"SnowflakeDoc output is highly correct with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical content. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in tables and a few instances where line references could be more precise, but overall syntax and structure are excellent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting that both outputs are syntactically well-formed within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileNotFound,N/A,1,"Implement robust file validation and provide alternative solutions when files are not found. Consider offering file location assistance or alternative data sources."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SnowflakeDoc,N/A,Multiple,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Minor improvements could include more consistent table formatting and enhanced cross-referencing between sections. Consider adding visual diagrams for complex data flows."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"The comparison reveals a fundamental capability gap. FileNotFound represents error handling while SnowflakeDoc demonstrates advanced analytical capabilities. For production systems, implement fallback mechanisms when primary analysis fails."
