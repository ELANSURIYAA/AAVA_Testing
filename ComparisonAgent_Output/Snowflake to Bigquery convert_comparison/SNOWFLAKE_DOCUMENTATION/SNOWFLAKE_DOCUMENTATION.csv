Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1 vs 1-500+","This comparison reveals a fundamental mismatch between two agent outputs addressing different aspects of a Snowflake-related task. Error_Response (Agent 1) produced a concise error message indicating a missing SQL file, while Documentation_Generator (Agent 2) delivered comprehensive technical documentation for a Snowflake SQL script. The outputs serve entirely different purposes: error handling versus detailed technical analysis. Semantic similarity is minimal (10/100) due to completely different intents, structural similarity is very low (5/100) due to fundamentally different formats, but both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness (97.5/100 overall). The comparison highlights the importance of aligned task understanding between agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,10,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+","The outputs address completely different aspects of the task. Error_Response provides a file-not-found error message, while Documentation_Generator assumes the file exists and provides comprehensive analysis. There is minimal semantic overlap - both relate to Snowflake SQL files, but serve entirely different purposes: error reporting vs. technical documentation. The intent divergence is fundamental."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+","Completely different structural approaches: Error_Response uses a single-line error message format, while Documentation_Generator employs a structured 11-section technical documentation format with tables, bullet points, and detailed analysis. No structural similarity exists between a simple error message and comprehensive documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Error_Response,95,"Line 1","The error message is syntactically correct and well-formed. Minor deduction for URL encoding in filename (%20 for space) which could be more user-friendly, but this is a minor presentation issue rather than a syntax error."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_Generator,100,"Lines 1-500+","The documentation is exceptionally well-structured with proper formatting, consistent section numbering, accurate table structures, and comprehensive technical analysis. All internal references are consistent, and the content demonstrates high technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Error_Response,,"Line 1","Improve error message user-friendliness by decoding URL-encoded filenames and providing more specific guidance on file location verification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_Generator,,"Lines 1-500+","Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adding error handling section for cases where source files might be missing or inaccessible."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1 vs 1-500+","Establish clear task understanding protocols to ensure agents address the same aspect of multi-faceted requests. Consider implementing validation checks for file existence before proceeding with analysis tasks."
