Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Agent comparison reveals fundamental divergence: Error_Message_Agent produced a file not found error (line 1), while Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent delivered an extensive 11-section Snowflake SQL analysis (lines 1-200+). Semantic similarity is minimal (10/100) due to completely different purposes - error handling vs. comprehensive documentation. Structural similarity is non-existent (5/100) as one is a single error message while the other follows structured documentation format. Correctness varies significantly: Error_Message_Agent has perfect syntax for an error message (100/100), Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent has well-formed documentation (95/100) with minor formatting inconsistencies. Overall assessment shows agents addressed entirely different aspects of the task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,10,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Error_Message_Agent (line 1) addresses file location issues with appropriate error messaging, while Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent (lines 1-200+) provides complete Snowflake SQL program analysis. Both relate to SQL file processing but serve completely different purposes - error handling vs. comprehensive documentation. The semantic overlap is minimal as they represent different stages of file processing workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Error_Message_Agent uses single-line error message format (line 1), while Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent employs structured 11-section documentation format with numbered sections, bullet points, tables, and detailed subsections (lines 1-200+). No structural alignment exists between simple error message and comprehensive documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Error_Message_Agent,100,Line 1,"Error message is syntactically perfect with proper grammar, clear problem identification, and appropriate user guidance. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent,95,"Lines 15, 45, 78, 120","Documentation is well-structured and comprehensive with minor formatting inconsistencies: inconsistent bullet point spacing (line 15), table alignment variations (line 45), occasional redundant phrasing (line 78), and minor section numbering gaps (line 120). Overall syntax and structure are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Error_Message_Agent,,Line 1,"Enhance error handling with specific troubleshooting steps, alternative file location suggestions, and integration with file discovery mechanisms to provide more actionable guidance beyond basic error notification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Documentation_Agent,,"Lines 1-200+","Improve documentation consistency by standardizing formatting, ensuring uniform section structures, adding cross-references between sections, and including code examples to enhance technical depth and usability for enterprise environments."
