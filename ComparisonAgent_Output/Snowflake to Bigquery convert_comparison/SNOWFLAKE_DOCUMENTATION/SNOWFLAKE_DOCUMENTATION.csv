Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs instead of template placeholders to enable meaningful comparison and scoring."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Ensure agent outputs contain the actual content to be compared rather than variable placeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Verify that the comparison task includes complete and valid agent outputs before initiating the comparison process."
