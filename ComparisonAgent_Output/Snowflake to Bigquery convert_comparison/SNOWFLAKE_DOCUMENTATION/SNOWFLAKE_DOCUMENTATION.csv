Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1 vs Lines 1-500+,"FileNotFound_Agent produced a single-line error message indicating inability to locate the specified SQL file, while Documentation_Agent generated comprehensive technical documentation with 11 detailed sections covering program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. The outputs represent fundamentally different response types - error handling versus detailed analysis - making direct comparison challenging but revealing significant capability differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+,"FileNotFound_Agent addresses file location issues (line 1), while Documentation_Agent provides comprehensive SQL analysis covering business logic, technical implementation, and optimization strategies. Both relate to SQL file processing but serve completely different purposes - error reporting versus detailed technical documentation. The semantic overlap is minimal as one indicates failure while the other demonstrates successful analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+,"FileNotFound_Agent uses simple error message structure (single sentence), while Documentation_Agent employs systematic 11-section documentation framework with numbered sections, subsections, tables, and detailed analysis. The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible - minimalist error reporting versus comprehensive technical documentation with hierarchical organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileNotFound_Agent,100,Line 1,"Syntactically correct error message with proper grammar, clear communication of the issue, and appropriate guidance for resolution. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_Agent,95,Lines 1-500+,"Well-structured documentation with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, and comprehensive coverage. Minor deduction for potential over-complexity in some sections and occasional redundancy in explanations, but overall syntactically sound and professionally formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileNotFound_Agent,N/A,Line 1,"Enhance error handling with more specific guidance, such as suggesting common file locations, providing file search capabilities, or offering alternative approaches when files are not found. Consider implementing file discovery mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-500+,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding executive summary at the beginning, implementing version control for documentation updates, and creating modular sections that can be referenced independently. The depth of analysis is impressive and demonstrates strong technical capability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"The outputs reveal a fundamental mismatch in agent capabilities and task interpretation. FileNotFound_Agent appears to be a file management utility, while Documentation_Agent is a technical analysis system. For future comparisons, ensure agents are addressing the same task scope and have compatible output formats. Consider implementing error recovery mechanisms that could bridge the gap between failure states and analytical capabilities."
