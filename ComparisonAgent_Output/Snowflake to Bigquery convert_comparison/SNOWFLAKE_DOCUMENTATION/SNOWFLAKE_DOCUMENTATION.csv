Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,"Lines 1 vs Lines 1-500+","Critical divergence identified: File_Locator failed to locate the target file and returned an error message, while Documentation_Analyzer provided comprehensive documentation analysis. This represents a fundamental task execution failure versus successful completion with extensive output."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+","Severe semantic divergence. File_Locator output indicates task failure with file location error, while Documentation_Analyzer demonstrates complete task understanding and execution with detailed Snowflake SQL analysis. The outputs address entirely different aspects - error handling versus comprehensive documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-500+","Minimal structural alignment. File_Locator provides single-line error message with no structured content, while Documentation_Analyzer delivers multi-section hierarchical documentation with 11 major sections, tables, and detailed analysis. Structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,File_Locator,85,"Line 1","Syntactically correct error message with proper grammar and clear instruction. However represents task execution failure rather than successful completion."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_Analyzer,95,"Lines 1-500+","Highly structured, syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and comprehensive coverage. Minor deduction for potential over-elaboration without source validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"N/A","Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,File_Locator,N/A,"Line 1","Critical: Implement robust file location mechanisms with fallback strategies. Add directory traversal capabilities and alternative file path resolution methods."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_Analyzer,N/A,"Lines 1-500+","Excellent: Maintain current comprehensive analysis approach. Consider adding source code validation and cross-referencing capabilities to ensure documentation accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"N/A","System Integration: Implement coordination mechanism where File_Locator success triggers Documentation_Analyzer execution, creating a robust two-stage pipeline for file processing and analysis."
