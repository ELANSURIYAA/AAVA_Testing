Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent 1 provides only an error message indicating inability to locate the required SQL file, while Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive test suite with 10 detailed test cases and complete Pytest implementation for BigQuery. The outputs represent fundamentally different completion states - failure vs. success."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-10","Agent 1 acknowledges the task (unit test design) but cannot proceed due to missing file. Agent 2 completes the full task with comprehensive test coverage. Both understand the testing requirement but only Agent 2 delivers actionable results."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Line 1 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent 1 has no structural elements - single error message. Agent 2 has well-organized structure: test case table, complete Pytest script with fixtures, helper functions, and 10 test methods. No structural similarity exists."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,"Line 1","Syntactically correct error message with proper grammar and clear communication of the issue. No syntax errors in the brief response."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 15-200+","Well-formed Python code with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor deduction for incomplete helper function implementations (setup_test_data, teardown_test_data marked as 'pass')."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Line 1","Implement file validation and fallback mechanisms. Provide alternative solutions when primary resources are unavailable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 50-55, 180-185","Complete the helper function implementations for setup_test_data and teardown_test_data. Add more specific assertions in test methods."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Agent 1 should handle missing dependencies gracefully with alternative approaches. Agent 2 should finalize all code components for production readiness."
