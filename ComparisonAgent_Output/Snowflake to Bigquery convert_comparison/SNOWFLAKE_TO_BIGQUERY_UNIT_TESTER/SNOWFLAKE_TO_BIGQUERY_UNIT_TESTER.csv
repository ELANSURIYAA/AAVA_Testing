Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Systematic comparison of two agent outputs for Snowflake to BigQuery unit testing task. Error_Message_Agent provided file not found error while Complete_Test_Suite_Agent delivered comprehensive test cases and implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Line 1 vs Lines 1-150,"Minimal semantic alignment. Error_Message_Agent addresses file location issue while Complete_Test_Suite_Agent provides complete testing solution. Different problem-solving approaches with limited conceptual overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Line 1 vs Lines 1-150,"Fundamentally different structures. Single error message versus comprehensive table and code structure. No comparable organizational patterns or logical flow alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Error_Message_Agent,85,Line 1,"Syntactically correct error message with clear communication. Appropriate request for file confirmation. Deduction for lack of alternative solution attempts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Complete_Test_Suite_Agent,95,Lines 1-150,"Valid table structure and Python syntax. Proper pytest implementation with BigQuery integration. Minor deduction for incomplete helper function implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"
