Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent File_Not_Found failed to locate the required Snowflake SQL file and provided only an error message requesting file confirmation. Agent Comprehensive_Test_Suite delivered a complete testing solution with 10 detailed test cases and a full pytest implementation for BigQuery, assuming successful Snowflake-to-BigQuery conversion. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches: error handling vs. comprehensive solution delivery."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent 1: Line 1, Agent 2: Lines 1-150","Agent File_Not_Found addresses file location issues while Agent Comprehensive_Test_Suite addresses unit testing requirements. Both relate to the same project context but tackle completely different aspects - file discovery vs. test implementation. The semantic overlap is minimal as one focuses on error reporting while the other provides complete functional testing coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Agent 1: Line 1, Agent 2: Lines 1-150","Agent File_Not_Found provides a single-line error message with no structural organization. Agent Comprehensive_Test_Suite follows a structured approach with test case documentation (lines 1-25), SQL query implementation (lines 27-85), and pytest test functions (lines 87-150). The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible - unstructured error vs. comprehensive organized solution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,File_Not_Found,85,Line 1,"The error message is syntactically correct and properly formatted. It clearly identifies the missing file issue and requests clarification. However, it lacks proactive problem-solving or alternative approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Test_Suite,95,"Lines 27-85, 87-150","The BigQuery SQL syntax is correct with proper JSON_VALUE usage, SAFE_CAST functions, and valid CTE structure. The pytest implementation follows PEP 8 standards with appropriate fixtures and test structure. Minor deduction for incomplete setup_test_data and teardown_test_data function implementations (referenced but not fully coded)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,File_Not_Found,,"Implement file discovery mechanisms, provide alternative file path suggestions, and include proactive troubleshooting steps rather than simple error reporting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Test_Suite,,"Complete the implementation of setup_test_data and teardown_test_data functions. Add more specific assertions for boundary conditions and consider adding integration test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Establish better communication protocols between agents to ensure file availability before proceeding with dependent tasks. Consider implementing file validation checkpoints in the workflow."
