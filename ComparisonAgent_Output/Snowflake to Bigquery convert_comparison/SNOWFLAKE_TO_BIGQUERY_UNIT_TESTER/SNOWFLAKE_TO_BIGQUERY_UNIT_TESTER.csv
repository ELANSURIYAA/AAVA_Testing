Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two fundamentally different approaches to handling missing file scenarios. File_Not_Found_Agent provides error handling with user guidance (line 1), while Comprehensive_Test_Generator delivers complete testing framework assuming file content knowledge. Semantic similarity is low (25/100) due to different problem-solving approaches. Structural similarity is minimal (15/100) as one is error message, other is comprehensive test suite. Correctness varies significantly - File_Not_Found_Agent has perfect syntax (100/100) for error message, Comprehensive_Test_Generator has minor issues (85/100) with incomplete helper functions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"File_Not_Found_Agent: Line 1, Comprehensive_Test_Generator: Lines 1-200","File_Not_Found_Agent focuses on error handling and user guidance when file is missing. Comprehensive_Test_Generator assumes file content knowledge and provides complete testing solution. Both address testing context but with fundamentally different approaches - reactive error handling vs proactive test generation. Limited semantic overlap in intent and purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"File_Not_Found_Agent: Line 1, Comprehensive_Test_Generator: Lines 1-200","File_Not_Found_Agent uses single-line error message structure. Comprehensive_Test_Generator uses multi-section structure: test case table (lines 3-14), SQL query (lines 16-80), pytest functions (lines 82-200). No structural alignment between simple error message and complex test framework. Completely different decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,File_Not_Found_Agent,100,Line 1,"Syntactically perfect error message. Clear grammar, proper punctuation, and well-formed sentence structure. No syntax errors or formatting issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Test_Generator,85,"Lines 18-19, Lines 82-200","Minor syntax issues: Incomplete helper functions setup_test_data() and teardown_test_data() contain only 'pass' statements (lines 18-19). Some test functions reference undefined variables like 'region_rank' in assertions (line 195). Overall Python and SQL syntax is valid but implementation gaps exist."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 85) / 2 = 92.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,File_Not_Found_Agent,,"Enhance error handling by providing specific troubleshooting steps, alternative file locations to check, or automated file discovery mechanisms. Consider offering to proceed with template or example content when original file is unavailable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Test_Generator,,"Complete implementation of helper functions setup_test_data() and teardown_test_data() with actual BigQuery table creation and data insertion logic. Fix undefined variable references in test assertions. Add error handling for BigQuery connection failures and timeout scenarios."
