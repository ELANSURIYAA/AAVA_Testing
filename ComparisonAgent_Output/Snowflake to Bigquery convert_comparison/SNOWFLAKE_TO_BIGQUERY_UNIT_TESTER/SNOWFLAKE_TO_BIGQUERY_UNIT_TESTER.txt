# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two fundamentally different approaches to handling missing file scenarios were analyzed. File_Not_Found_Agent provides error handling with user guidance, while Comprehensive_Test_Generator delivers a complete testing framework assuming file content knowledge. The outputs show minimal alignment across all evaluation dimensions, with an overall score of 44.17/100.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 25/100)

The agents demonstrate fundamentally different problem-solving philosophies:

- **File_Not_Found_Agent** (Line 1): Takes a reactive approach, immediately surfacing the missing file issue and requesting user intervention
- **Comprehensive_Test_Generator** (Lines 1-200): Takes a proactive approach, assuming knowledge of the file content and delivering a complete testing solution

Both outputs relate to the testing context, but their semantic intent diverges significantly. One focuses on error handling and user guidance, while the other assumes file content knowledge and provides comprehensive test coverage.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 15/100)

The structural approaches are completely different:

- **File_Not_Found_Agent**: Single-line error message structure
- **Comprehensive_Test_Generator**: Multi-section structure including:
  - Test case table (lines 3-14)
  - SQL query conversion (lines 16-80) 
  - Pytest functions (lines 82-200)

No structural alignment exists between the simple error message and the complex test framework architecture.

### Correctness

**File_Not_Found_Agent (100/100)**: Syntactically perfect error message with clear grammar, proper punctuation, and well-formed sentence structure.

**Comprehensive_Test_Generator (85/100)**: Minor syntax issues including incomplete helper functions `setup_test_data()` and `teardown_test_data()` containing only 'pass' statements (lines 18-19), and some test functions referencing undefined variables like 'region_rank' in assertions (line 195).

**Overall Correctness: 92.5/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | File_Not_Found_Agent | Comprehensive_Test_Generator | Overall |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 25 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Correctness | 100 | 85 | 92.5 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **44.17** |

## Recommendations

**For File_Not_Found_Agent:**
- Enhance error handling by providing specific troubleshooting steps
- Suggest alternative file locations to check
- Consider offering to proceed with template or example content when original file is unavailable
- Implement automated file discovery mechanisms

**For Comprehensive_Test_Generator:**
- Complete implementation of helper functions `setup_test_data()` and `teardown_test_data()` with actual BigQuery table creation and data insertion logic
- Fix undefined variable references in test assertions
- Add error handling for BigQuery connection failures and timeout scenarios
- Validate all test function implementations for completeness
