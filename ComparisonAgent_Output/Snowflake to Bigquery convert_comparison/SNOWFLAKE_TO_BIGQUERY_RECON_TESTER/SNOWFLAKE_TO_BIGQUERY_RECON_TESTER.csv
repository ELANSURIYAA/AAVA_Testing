Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents implement Snowflake to BigQuery data migration pipelines with similar core functionality. Agent 2 provides significantly enhanced enterprise-grade features including comprehensive logging, error handling, data validation, and detailed reporting capabilities. While both achieve the same fundamental goal, Agent 2 demonstrates superior production readiness and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (both agents)","Both agents address identical migration requirements: Snowflake query execution, Parquet export, GCS upload, BigQuery external table creation, and data validation. Agent 1 focuses on basic workflow implementation while Agent 2 extends with enterprise features like comprehensive logging, detailed comparison reporting, and robust error handling. Core business logic and data transformation intent are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100, Lines 51-100 vs 200-300","Both follow similar high-level structure: environment setup, connection functions, data processing pipeline, and main execution flow. Agent 2 introduces additional structural layers including utility functions (lines 85-120), enhanced schema inference (lines 122-140), and comprehensive comparison logic (lines 142-180). Control flow patterns are consistent but Agent 2 has more sophisticated error handling and logging integration throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER,75,"Lines 35, 37, 39","Syntax error on line 35: 'SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER.csv' is not a valid variable name due to dots in identifier. Same issue on lines 37 and 39. Variable naming violates Python syntax rules. All other syntax elements are valid including imports, function definitions, and control structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Enhanced_Migration_Script,95,"Lines 280-285","Minor issue with potential undefined variable 'ext_table_df' if BigQuery external table query fails before assignment (line 282). All other syntax is valid with proper imports, function definitions, exception handling, and variable scoping. Code demonstrates high syntactic quality with consistent formatting and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores (75 + 95) / 2 = 85. Both agents are largely syntactically correct with Agent 1 having variable naming violations and Agent 2 having minor scoping considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER,,"Fix variable naming syntax errors on lines 35, 37, 39 by replacing dots with underscores (e.g., 'SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER_csv'). Add comprehensive error handling and logging similar to Agent 2. Implement data validation and comparison reporting for production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Enhanced_Migration_Script,,"Address potential variable scoping issue around line 282 by adding proper error handling for external table query failures. Consider adding configuration file support for better maintainability. The comprehensive approach with logging and validation makes this production-ready."
