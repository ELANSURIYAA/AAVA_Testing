Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Received placeholder text '{{agent 1_string_true}}' and '{{agent 2_string_true}}' instead of actual content. A valid comparison requires actual agent outputs to analyze semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of two distinct outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output. Syntax-level validation requires real content to analyze."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output. Syntax-level validation requires real content to analyze."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform a valid comparison: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text, 2) Ensure outputs are in a comparable format, 3) Include sufficient context about the task or problem being solved, 4) Verify that both agents attempted to solve the same problem."
