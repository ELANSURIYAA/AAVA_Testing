Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide Python scripts for Snowflake to BigQuery data migration using Parquet files and Google Cloud Storage as intermediate storage. Agent 1 provides a basic implementation with core functionality, while Agent 2 delivers an enterprise-grade solution with comprehensive error handling, logging, validation, and modular design. Agent 1 contains critical syntax errors that prevent execution, while Agent 2 demonstrates production-ready code quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both scripts address the identical core objective of migrating data from Snowflake to BigQuery via Parquet export and GCS transfer. They implement the same fundamental workflow: execute Snowflake query, export to Parquet, upload to GCS, create BigQuery external table, execute BigQuery query, and validate results. The semantic intent and business logic are highly aligned, with both scripts targeting the same use case and following similar transformation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both scripts follow similar high-level structure with sequential steps for the migration process. However, Agent 2 demonstrates superior modular design with dedicated utility functions, comprehensive configuration management, and better separation of concerns. Agent 1 uses a more linear approach with functions embedded in the main execution flow, while Agent 2 organizes code into logical sections with utility functions, configuration constants, and structured error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,25,"Lines 33, 35, 37","Agent 1 contains critical syntax errors that prevent execution. Line 33 uses invalid variable name 'SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER.csv' which contains dots in the variable name, violating Python naming conventions. This error is repeated on lines 35 and 37, making the script non-executable. Additionally, the script lacks proper error handling and validation mechanisms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, valid variable names, appropriate imports, and well-structured code organization. The script includes comprehensive error handling, logging mechanisms, and follows Python best practices. Minor deduction for some potential edge cases in schema inference logic, but overall the code is production-ready and syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,60,"","Average correctness score reflecting the significant syntax errors in Agent 1 balanced against the high-quality implementation in Agent 2."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 33, 35, 37","Critical: Fix syntax errors by replacing 'SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_RECON_TESTER.csv' with valid Python variable names like 'parquet_filename'. Add comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms. Implement input validation and connection management best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"","Excellent implementation. Consider adding more granular configuration options and potentially async operations for large dataset handling. The current implementation is production-ready and follows enterprise best practices."
