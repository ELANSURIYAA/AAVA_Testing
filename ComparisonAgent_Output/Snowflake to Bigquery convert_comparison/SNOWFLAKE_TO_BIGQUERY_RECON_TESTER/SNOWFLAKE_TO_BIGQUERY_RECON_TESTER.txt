# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**ERROR: No agent outputs provided for comparison.** The input contains placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` but no actual content to analyze. Cannot perform semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation without actual agent outputs.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - no agent outputs provided for comparison.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity - no agent outputs provided for comparison.

### Correctness
- **Agent1**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 1 output not provided
- **Agent2**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 2 output not provided  
- **Overall**: N/A/100 - Cannot calculate overall correctness - no agent outputs available

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide actual agent outputs** to enable comprehensive comparison and scoring across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions
2. Ensure agent outputs contain actual code, documentation, or test cases rather than placeholder variables
3. Include proper context about the task the agents were supposed to perform
