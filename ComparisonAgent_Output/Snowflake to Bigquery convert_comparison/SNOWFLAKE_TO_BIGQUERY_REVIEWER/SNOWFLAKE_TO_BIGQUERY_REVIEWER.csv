Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion with similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and optimization needs. Agent_2_Review provides more detailed technical analysis while Agent_1_Review offers more concise practical recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical conversion review goals with similar conclusions about JSON handling, clustering issues, and optimization needs. Agent_2_Review provides deeper technical detail on edge cases and error handling (lines 15-25), while Agent_1_Review focuses more on practical implementation concerns (lines 20-30). Both identify the same core issues: CLUSTER BY removal, JSON function conversion accuracy, and performance optimization needs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both follow nearly identical 6-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations. Agent_2_Review uses more detailed subsections within Conversion Accuracy (lines 8-15) and provides more granular analysis. Agent_1_Review uses more concise bullet-point style organization. Both maintain logical flow from technical analysis to business recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Review,95,"Lines 1-30","Well-formatted documentation with clear section headers, proper grammar, and coherent technical content. Minor issue: some technical details could be more specific (line 15 mentions 'performance should be tested' without specific metrics)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Review,98,"Lines 1-50","Excellent technical documentation with comprehensive coverage, proper formatting, and detailed technical analysis. Very minor issue: slight redundancy in JSON handling explanation (lines 18-20)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
