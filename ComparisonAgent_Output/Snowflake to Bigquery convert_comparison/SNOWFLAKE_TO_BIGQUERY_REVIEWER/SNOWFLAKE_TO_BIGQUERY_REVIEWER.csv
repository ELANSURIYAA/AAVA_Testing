Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided in input. Received placeholder text {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content. This framework demonstrates the expected CSV structure for agent output comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would analyze meaning alignment, intent matching, and purpose coherence between the two outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would compare logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_REVIEWER_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_REVIEWER_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness average without individual agent evaluations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text. 2. Ensure outputs contain identifiable content for semantic analysis. 3. Include line numbers or structured format for detailed comparison. 4. Specify output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test case) for targeted evaluation criteria."
