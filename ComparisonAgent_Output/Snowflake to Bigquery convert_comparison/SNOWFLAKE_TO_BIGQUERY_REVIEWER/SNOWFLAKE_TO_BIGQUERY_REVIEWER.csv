Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a Snowflake to BigQuery conversion comparison task based on the file path context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Would typically assess whether both outputs address the same Snowflake to BigQuery conversion goals and apply similar transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically compare SQL structure, CTE usage, function organization, and conversion approach between agents."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_AGENT,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content. Would typically validate SQL syntax, table references, and Snowflake-specific constructs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,BIGQUERY_AGENT,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content. Would typically validate BigQuery SQL syntax, dataset references, and BigQuery-specific functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be determined without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure template variables are properly replaced with real content. 3. Include line numbers in outputs for precise reference. 4. Specify the exact nature of the Snowflake to BigQuery conversion task for context-appropriate evaluation."
