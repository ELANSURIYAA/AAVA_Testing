Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion with similar overall conclusions about conversion accuracy and optimization needs. Agent 1 provides a more concise 6-point summary while Agent 2 offers a more detailed 6-section analysis with extensive technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs address the same core task of evaluating Snowflake to BigQuery conversion accuracy. They share similar conclusions about successful conversion of data types, JSON handling, and window functions. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more technical depth with specific function mappings (SAFE_CAST, JSON_VALUE) and comprehensive edge case analysis, while Agent 1 focuses on higher-level conversion principles."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both follow similar review structures with sections on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization, and recommendations. Agent 1 uses a numbered 6-point structure (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations) while Agent 2 uses a more detailed 6-section approach with extensive subsections. The logical flow is comparable but Agent 2 provides much more granular organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 8-10, 15-17","Agent 1 correctly identifies key conversion elements like CAST() functions, JSON extraction, and clustering issues. Minor imprecision in describing semi-structured data handling specifics and lack of detailed function mapping examples."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 12-15, 25-30, 45-50","Agent 2 demonstrates high technical accuracy with precise function mappings (SAFE_CAST, JSON_VALUE), comprehensive edge case coverage, and detailed syntax analysis. Very minor gaps in some optimization recommendations specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with Agent 2 showing slightly higher precision in technical details and function mappings."
