# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Unable to perform comparison analysis - agent outputs not provided in input. The system received placeholders `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual content to compare.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The analysis requires concrete content to assess meaning, intent, and overall purpose alignment between the two agents.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. This dimension requires examining logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches which are not available.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: N/A - No output provided for syntax validation
- **Agent 2**: N/A - No output provided for syntax validation  
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot compute overall correctness without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace the placeholder variables with actual agent-generated content for meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Verify Runtime Parameters**: Ensure all runtime parameters (repository, branch, token, folder, file name) are properly substituted before execution.

3. **Content Validation**: Once actual outputs are provided, the system will perform comprehensive analysis across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions with detailed line-by-line comparisons.
