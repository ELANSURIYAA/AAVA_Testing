# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a Snowflake to BigQuery conversion comparison task based on the file path context.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Would typically assess whether both outputs address the same Snowflake to BigQuery conversion goals and apply similar transformation logic.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically compare SQL structure, CTE usage, function organization, and conversion approach between agents.

### Correctness
- **SNOWFLAKE_AGENT**: Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content. Would typically validate SQL syntax, table references, and Snowflake-specific constructs.
- **BIGQUERY_AGENT**: Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual output content. Would typically validate BigQuery SQL syntax, dataset references, and BigQuery-specific functions.
- **Overall**: Overall correctness cannot be determined without individual agent evaluations.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SNOWFLAKE_AGENT | BIGQUERY_AGENT | Overall |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis** - The template variables need to be replaced with real content from the agents being compared.

2. **Ensure template variables are properly replaced** - All placeholder variables like {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} must contain actual agent outputs.

3. **Include line numbers in outputs** - For precise reference and detailed analysis, outputs should include line numbering.

4. **Specify the exact nature of the Snowflake to BigQuery conversion task** - More context about the specific conversion requirements would enable more targeted evaluation criteria.
