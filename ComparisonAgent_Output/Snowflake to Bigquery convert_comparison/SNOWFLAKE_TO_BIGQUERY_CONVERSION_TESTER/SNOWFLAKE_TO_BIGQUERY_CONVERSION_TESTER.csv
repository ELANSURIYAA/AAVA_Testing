Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided. Placeholder values {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} found instead of actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires real content to evaluate intent alignment and meaning correspondence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires real content to evaluate logical flow and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison and scoring."
