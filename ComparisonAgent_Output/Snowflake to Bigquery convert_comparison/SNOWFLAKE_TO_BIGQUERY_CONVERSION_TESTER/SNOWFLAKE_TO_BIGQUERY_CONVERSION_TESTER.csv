Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide test case documentation for Snowflake to BigQuery conversion validation. Agent1 delivers 6 focused test cases covering core conversion aspects with basic pytest implementation. Agent2 provides 10 comprehensive test cases including edge cases, error handling, and performance scenarios with professional pytest structure including fixtures and helper functions. Agent2 demonstrates superior test coverage and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Agent1: Lines 1-50, Agent2: Lines 1-150","Both outputs address Snowflake to BigQuery conversion testing with similar core intent. Agent1 focuses on 6 fundamental conversion aspects (JSON field access, ARRAY_AGG, type casting, window functions, filtering, performance). Agent2 expands this to 10 comprehensive scenarios including happy path, edge cases, boundary conditions, error handling, and performance testing. Agent2 shows deeper understanding of testing methodology with data anomaly scenarios and comprehensive validation approaches. The semantic alignment is strong but Agent2 provides broader scope and more sophisticated test design."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Agent1: Lines 1-50, Agent2: Lines 1-150","Both follow test case documentation → pytest script structure but with significant implementation differences. Agent1 uses simple list format for test cases with basic pytest functions. Agent2 employs professional table format with comprehensive pytest implementation including module-level fixtures, helper functions for setup/teardown, and detailed test scenarios. Agent1 structure is straightforward but limited, while Agent2 demonstrates enterprise-grade test automation structure with proper separation of concerns and reusable components."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,70,"Lines 25-50","Basic syntax correctness with valid pytest structure. However, implementation is incomplete with placeholder queries (lines 28, 34, 40, 46), missing test data setup, and overly simple assertions. The BigQuery client fixture is correctly implemented but test functions lack comprehensive validation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,90,"Lines 50-150","Professional pytest implementation with proper fixtures, comprehensive SQL query with correct BigQuery syntax, and detailed test scenarios. Minor deduction for placeholder helper functions (setup_test_data, teardown_test_data) at lines 60-65, but overall structure and implementation are enterprise-grade with proper error handling and comprehensive test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,80,,"Average of individual agent scores. Agent2 significantly outperforms Agent1 in implementation completeness and professional structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Enhance test case documentation with table format for better readability. Implement complete BigQuery queries instead of placeholders. Add comprehensive test data setup and teardown procedures. Include edge cases and error handling scenarios. Improve assertion logic with specific validation criteria."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Complete implementation of helper functions (setup_test_data, teardown_test_data). Add more specific performance benchmarks for large dataset testing. Consider adding integration test scenarios with actual Snowflake comparison. Include data validation checksums for result verification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Agent2 provides superior test coverage and implementation quality. Agent1 should adopt Agent2's comprehensive approach including table format documentation, professional pytest structure, and extensive edge case coverage. Both agents should ensure complete implementation of all helper functions and test data management procedures."
