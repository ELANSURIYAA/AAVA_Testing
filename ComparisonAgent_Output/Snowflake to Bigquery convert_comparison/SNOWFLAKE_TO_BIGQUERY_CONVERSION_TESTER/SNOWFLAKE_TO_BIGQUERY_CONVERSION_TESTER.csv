Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide test case documentation for Snowflake to BigQuery conversion validation. TestCaseDoc1 offers basic test coverage with 6 test cases and simple pytest implementation. TestCaseDoc2 provides comprehensive testing with 10 test cases, professional table format, advanced pytest structure with fixtures, and broader coverage including edge cases and error handling. TestCaseDoc2 demonstrates superior completeness and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (TestCaseDoc1), Lines 1-100 (TestCaseDoc2)","Both outputs address identical core objective of validating Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion. TestCaseDoc1 covers fundamental conversion aspects: JSON field access (TC001), ARRAY_AGG (TC002), type casting (TC003), window functions (TC004), semi-structured filtering (TC005), and performance (TC006). TestCaseDoc2 covers same core areas but expands with comprehensive edge cases: null handling (TC03), missing metadata fields (TC04), boundary conditions (TC06), empty datasets (TC07), invalid JSON (TC08), and performance at scale (TC10). Both demonstrate same understanding of conversion challenges but TestCaseDoc2 shows deeper analysis of potential failure scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Lines 1-30 (TestCaseDoc1), Lines 1-50 (TestCaseDoc2)","TestCaseDoc1 uses simple numbered list format for test cases with basic structure: ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, placeholders for Actual Result and Pass/Fail Status. TestCaseDoc2 employs professional table format with identical column structure but enhanced readability. Both follow similar logical progression from basic to complex scenarios. Key structural difference: TestCaseDoc2 includes comprehensive pytest implementation with proper fixtures (lines 51-70), helper functions for setup/teardown (lines 45-50), and modular test organization, while TestCaseDoc1 has basic pytest structure without fixtures or proper test data management."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,TestCaseDoc1,75,"Lines 31-60","TestCaseDoc1 pytest script has valid Python syntax and proper BigQuery client initialization. Issues: Missing proper test data setup/teardown (line 35-40), basic assertions without comprehensive validation (lines 45-60), placeholder query structure without actual BigQuery-specific syntax conversion examples, and incomplete test isolation. Test functions are syntactically correct but lack production-ready implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,TestCaseDoc2,92,"Lines 51-150","TestCaseDoc2 demonstrates superior correctness with comprehensive pytest implementation. Proper fixture usage for BigQuery client (lines 51-53), structured test data management with setup/teardown functions (lines 35-42), complete BigQuery SQL query with proper JSON extraction using SAFE_CAST and JSON_VALUE (lines 70-120), comprehensive test assertions covering multiple scenarios, and proper error handling. Minor issues: Some helper functions are not fully implemented (marked as 'pass' placeholders on lines 38-40), but overall structure is production-ready."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,84,,"Average of TestCaseDoc1 (75) and TestCaseDoc2 (92). TestCaseDoc2 significantly outperforms in implementation completeness and production readiness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,TestCaseDoc1,,"Enhance pytest implementation with proper fixtures and test data management. Add comprehensive assertions beyond basic 'not None' checks. Implement actual BigQuery-specific SQL conversion examples in test queries. Include edge case coverage for null handling, invalid JSON, and boundary conditions. Add proper test isolation with setup/teardown mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,TestCaseDoc2,,"Complete implementation of helper functions marked as 'pass' placeholders. Consider adding more specific performance benchmarks in test_large_dataset_performance. Add validation for actual data comparison between Snowflake and BigQuery results. Include integration tests with actual database connections for end-to-end validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"TestCaseDoc2 serves as excellent template for production testing. Both outputs should include actual test data samples and expected results for better validation. Consider adding automated test execution reports and CI/CD integration guidelines. TestCaseDoc1 should adopt TestCaseDoc2's table format and comprehensive pytest structure for improved maintainability."
