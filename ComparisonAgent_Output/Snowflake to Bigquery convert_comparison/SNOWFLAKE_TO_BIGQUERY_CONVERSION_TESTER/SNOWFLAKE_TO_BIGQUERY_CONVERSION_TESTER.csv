Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two test case documents for Snowflake to BigQuery conversion testing. Agent 1 provides 6 basic test cases focusing on specific syntax conversions with simple pytest structure. Agent 2 delivers 10 comprehensive test cases including edge cases and error handling with complete BigQuery SQL implementation. Both address the same conversion testing goal but with significantly different depth and coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs target Snowflake to BigQuery conversion testing with overlapping core concepts. Agent 1 focuses on 6 specific syntax validations (JSON field access, ARRAY_AGG, type casting, window functions, semi-structured filtering, performance). Agent 2 covers similar areas but expands to 10 test cases including comprehensive edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions. The semantic intent aligns on conversion validation but diverges in scope and thoroughness."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,N/A,"Agent 1 uses simple text-based test case format with basic pytest structure. Agent 2 employs structured table format with detailed columns (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status) and comprehensive pytest implementation with fixtures, helper functions, and actual BigQuery SQL. Both follow test case documentation patterns but with different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test Case Document (Basic),85,Lines 45-80,"Pytest script has valid Python syntax and proper imports. Test functions are well-structured with appropriate assertions. However, queries are placeholder-level without actual BigQuery-specific syntax implementation. Missing comprehensive test setup and teardown functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test Case Document (Comprehensive),95,Lines 50-200,"Complete pytest implementation with proper BigQuery client setup, fixtures, helper functions for test data management, and actual BigQuery SQL with correct syntax (JSON_VALUE, SAFE_CAST, etc.). Minor deduction for incomplete setup_test_data and teardown_test_data function implementations (marked as 'pass')."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate good technical accuracy with Agent 2 showing superior implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test Case Document (Basic),N/A,Lines 1-44,"Enhance test case documentation with structured format including preconditions, detailed test steps, and expected results. Implement actual BigQuery SQL syntax in pytest functions rather than placeholder queries. Add comprehensive edge case and error handling test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test Case Document (Comprehensive),N/A,Lines 50-200,"Complete the implementation of setup_test_data and teardown_test_data helper functions. Consider adding more specific assertions for data validation. Add performance benchmarking capabilities for large dataset testing as mentioned in TC10."
