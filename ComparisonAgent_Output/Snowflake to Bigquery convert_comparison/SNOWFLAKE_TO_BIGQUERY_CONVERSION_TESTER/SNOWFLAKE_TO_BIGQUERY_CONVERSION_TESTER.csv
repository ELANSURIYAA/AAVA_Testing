Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-100+ (both outputs)","Both agents produced test case documents for Snowflake to BigQuery conversion validation. Agent2_TestCases provides more comprehensive coverage with 10 test cases vs 6, includes detailed table format, edge cases, error handling, and a complete BigQuery SQL query. Agent1_TestCases offers simpler structure but lacks depth in test scenarios and implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (both)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion. They cover similar fundamental areas like JSON field access, array aggregation, type casting, and window functions. However, Agent2_TestCases expands significantly into edge cases, error handling, and performance testing that Agent1_TestCases lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-20, 51-100","Agent1_TestCases uses simple sequential format with basic test case structure. Agent2_TestCases employs professional table format with standardized columns (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Pass/Fail Status). The pytest implementations differ significantly in complexity and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_TestCases,85,"Lines 51-100","Pytest script has valid Python syntax and proper BigQuery client usage. However, queries are incomplete placeholders ('project.dataset.table') and assertions are too generic. Missing proper test data setup and teardown functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_TestCases,95,"Lines 51-200+","Comprehensive pytest implementation with proper fixtures, helper functions, complete BigQuery SQL query, and detailed test scenarios. Minor issues: setup_test_data and teardown_test_data functions are declared but not implemented (lines 15-20)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_TestCases,,"Lines 10-50","Expand test coverage to include edge cases and error scenarios. Implement complete BigQuery SQL queries instead of placeholders. Add proper test data management and more specific assertions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_TestCases,,"Lines 15-20","Implement the declared setup_test_data and teardown_test_data helper functions to make the test suite fully executable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Agent2_TestCases demonstrates superior test design with comprehensive coverage and professional structure. Agent1_TestCases should adopt the table format and expand test scenarios to match industry standards."
