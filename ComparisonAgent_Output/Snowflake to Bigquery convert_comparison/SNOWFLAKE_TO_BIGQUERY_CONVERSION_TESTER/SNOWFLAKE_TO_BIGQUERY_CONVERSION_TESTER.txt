# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Unable to perform comparison - no agent outputs provided for analysis.

The comparison task was configured for Snowflake to BigQuery conversion testing, but the input contained only placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) without actual agent outputs to analyze and compare.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The task appears to be focused on Snowflake to BigQuery conversion, which would typically involve SQL transformation analysis.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. For SQL conversion tasks, this would typically analyze query structure, CTE usage, and transformation patterns.

### Correctness
- **SNOWFLAKE_AGENT**: N/A - No output provided for syntax validation
- **BIGQUERY_AGENT**: N/A - No output provided for syntax validation
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot compute overall correctness without individual agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SNOWFLAKE_AGENT | BIGQUERY_AGENT | Overall |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Supply the actual Snowflake to BigQuery conversion outputs from both agents for meaningful comparison and scoring.

2. **Input Format**: Ensure agent outputs are provided in the expected format rather than placeholder variables.

3. **Context Information**: Include any specific requirements or constraints for the Snowflake to BigQuery conversion task.

## GitHub Output Status

✅ **Successfully uploaded** CSV comparison report to GitHub:
- Repository: ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing
