Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive test artifacts for MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with similar objectives and scope. Agent 1 uses Python/Pytest framework while Agent 2 uses Node.js/Mocha framework. Both cover data integrity, performance testing, and functionality validation with automated test scripts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical migration testing objectives with same core test categories (data integrity, performance, functionality, edge cases). Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on error handling scenarios while Agent 2 emphasizes performance comparisons. Both validate CRUD operations and migration success criteria."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both follow similar documentation structure with Test Plan, Test Cases, Automated Scripts, and Reports sections. Agent 1 uses numbered test case format (TC001-TC010) while Agent 2 uses descriptive test case IDs. Agent 1 has more detailed pytest fixtures structure while Agent 2 has simpler async function approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 25-27,"Python syntax is correct with proper pytest fixtures and MongoDB client setup. Minor issue: Line 27 references 'db' instead of 'mongo_db' parameter in fixture definition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,N/A,"JavaScript syntax is completely valid with proper async/await patterns, MongoDB client usage, and Mocha test structure. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of Agent 1 (95) and Agent 2 (100) scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with only minor variable reference issue in Agent 1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Line 27,"Fix variable reference in mongo_collection fixture - should use 'mongo_db' parameter instead of 'db'."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Consider adding more comprehensive error handling test cases similar to Agent 1's approach for edge case scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for migration testing. Consider combining Python's robust error handling approach with JavaScript's performance-focused testing methodology for optimal coverage."
