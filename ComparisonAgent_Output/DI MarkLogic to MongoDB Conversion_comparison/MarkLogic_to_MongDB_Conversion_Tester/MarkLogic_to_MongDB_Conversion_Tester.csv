Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-156,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test artifacts for MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with similar objectives and scope. Agent 1 uses Python/Pytest framework while Agent 2 uses Node.js/Mocha/Chai. Both include test plans, test cases, automated scripts, and detailed reports. Key differences: Agent 1 provides 10 specific test cases with complete pytest implementation, while Agent 2 focuses on 4 main test categories with JavaScript implementation. Agent 1 includes more edge case handling and error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-156,"Both outputs address the same core objective of validating MarkLogic to MongoDB migration. They share similar testing strategies (data integrity, performance, functionality, edge cases) and comparable scope coverage. Agent 1 focuses more on CRUD operations and error handling (lines 45-120), while Agent 2 emphasizes schema mapping and index migration validation (lines 25-45). Both conclude with findings and recommendations for optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-156,"Both follow similar high-level structure: Test Plan -> Test Cases -> Automated Scripts -> Report/Findings. However, Agent 1 uses a more granular approach with 10 numbered test cases (lines 25-44) and comprehensive pytest fixtures (lines 50-120), while Agent 2 uses 4 categorized test areas (lines 20-45) with simpler script structure (lines 60-85). Agent 1 includes more detailed error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,50-120,"Python/Pytest code is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions. Minor issue: line 65 uses 'db' instead of 'mongo_db' parameter. All MongoDB operations use correct pymongo syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,60-85,"JavaScript/Node.js code is syntactically correct with proper async/await patterns, MongoDB client usage, and assert statements. All variable references are consistent and MongoDB operations follow correct syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minimal syntax issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,65,"Fix variable reference issue on line 65: change 'db' to 'mongo_db' to match fixture parameter. Consider adding more detailed performance benchmarking tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,60-85,"Expand test coverage to include more edge cases and error scenarios similar to Agent1's approach. Add more comprehensive CRUD operation testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-156,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for migration testing. Consider combining Agent1's comprehensive error handling with Agent2's focus on schema validation for optimal test coverage. Standardize on single testing framework for consistency across team."
