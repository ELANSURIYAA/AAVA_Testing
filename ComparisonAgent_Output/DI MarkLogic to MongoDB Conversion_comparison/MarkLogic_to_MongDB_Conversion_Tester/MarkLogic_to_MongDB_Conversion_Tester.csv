Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive test artifacts for MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with high semantic alignment (88/100), good structural similarity (82/100), and excellent correctness (95/100 average). The outputs demonstrate professional-grade testing documentation with automated scripts, though they differ in technology stack choices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15, 45-60, 80-95","Both outputs address identical migration testing objectives including data integrity validation, performance testing, functionality verification, and edge case handling. Core testing strategies and goals are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in emphasis on XML/BSON conversion specifics and namespace handling reduce perfect alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-10, 20-35, 70-85","Both follow similar high-level structure: Test Plan → Test Cases → Automated Scripts → Report. Agent 1 uses numbered test case format (TC001-TC010) while Agent 2 uses descriptive subsections. Agent 1 provides more detailed pytest fixtures while Agent 2 focuses on Mocha/Chai framework. Overall flow and logical decomposition are well-aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,96,"Lines 25-70","Python pytest syntax is correct with proper fixture definitions, MongoDB client setup, and test assertions. All imports are valid. Minor issue: Line 32 uses 'db' instead of 'mongo_db' parameter in fixture definition. Exception handling in tests 6-7 and 9-10 may not catch the intended MongoDB-specific exceptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,94,"Lines 40-55","Node.js syntax is correct with proper async/await patterns and MongoDB client usage. All imports and assertions are valid. Minor issue: Line 45 missing 'const' declaration could cause scope issues. The test structure follows Mocha conventions properly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with only minor variable reference and declaration issues that don't break overall functionality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Fix variable reference on line 32 (use 'mongo_db' instead of 'db'). Enhance exception handling in edge case tests to catch specific MongoDB exceptions rather than generic Exception class."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Add 'const' declaration on line 45 for proper variable scoping. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling in the test script."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide excellent migration testing frameworks. Consider combining the comprehensive test case coverage from Agent 1 with the clean async/await patterns from Agent 2. Both would benefit from adding performance benchmarking utilities and data validation checksums."
