Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-156 (Agent1), Lines 1-108 (Agent2)","Both agents successfully created comprehensive test artifacts for MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with high semantic alignment (92/100) and strong structural similarity (88/100). Agent1 uses pytest/Python framework while Agent2 uses Mocha/Node.js framework. Both demonstrate solid syntax correctness with minor issues in edge case handling. Overall assessment: 89/100."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-20 (both agents)","Both outputs address identical migration testing objectives with comprehensive coverage of data integrity, performance, functionality, and edge cases. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent1 focuses more on detailed test case enumeration (TC001-TC010) while Agent2 emphasizes schema mapping and hierarchical relationships. Both demonstrate clear understanding of MarkLogic to MongoDB migration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 21-156 (Agent1), Lines 21-108 (Agent2)","Both follow similar logical structure: Test Plan → Test Cases → Automated Scripts → Detailed Report. Agent1 provides more granular test case breakdown with 10 specific test cases, while Agent2 focuses on 4 broader categories. Both include comprehensive automated testing sections with appropriate framework choices for their respective languages."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,87,"Lines 85-90, 95-97","Python pytest code is mostly syntactically correct. Issues identified: Line 85 - undefined variable 'db' should be 'mongo_db', Line 95-97 - pytest.raises() usage for empty document insertion may not raise exception as MongoDB allows empty documents, Line 140-142 - invalid document structure test assumes exception but MongoDB is schema-flexible."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,91,"Lines 65-85","JavaScript/Node.js code demonstrates good syntax and structure. Minor issue: Line 75 - assert.strictEqual usage is correct but could benefit from more descriptive error messages. The async/await pattern is properly implemented and MongoDB client connection handling follows best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both agents demonstrate strong technical competency with minor syntax and logical issues that would be easily resolved in implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 85, 95-97, 140-142","Fix undefined variable reference on line 85 (db → mongo_db). Reconsider pytest.raises() expectations for empty documents and invalid structures as MongoDB is schema-flexible and may not raise exceptions as expected."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 75, 80-85","Enhance error handling with more descriptive assertion messages. Consider adding more comprehensive edge case testing similar to Agent1's approach with 10 detailed test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both agents provide excellent foundation for MarkLogic to MongoDB migration testing. Consider combining Agent1's comprehensive test case enumeration with Agent2's cleaner code structure. Both frameworks (pytest and Mocha) are appropriate choices for their respective ecosystems."
