Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between Pytest_Script (detailed MongoDB test implementation) and Analysis_Summary (high-level migration summary). Pytest_Script provides concrete, executable test cases with 10 specific test scenarios covering CRUD operations, error handling, and performance testing. Analysis_Summary offers only a brief paragraph acknowledging completion of analysis without technical details. Significant disparity in depth, actionability, and technical value."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,N/A,"Both outputs address MongoDB migration testing domain but with fundamentally different approaches and depth. Pytest_Script (lines 1-95) provides specific, actionable test cases covering document loading, insertion, search, update, deletion, error handling, and performance scenarios. Analysis_Summary (lines 1-3) offers only high-level acknowledgment of completion without technical substance. While both relate to MongoDB migration, the semantic alignment is poor due to vast differences in specificity and actionability."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,N/A,"Pytest_Script follows structured pytest framework with fixtures (lines 4-18), individual test functions (lines 20-95), proper setup/teardown, and logical test organization. Analysis_Summary lacks any meaningful structure - just a single paragraph statement. No comparable structural elements exist between outputs. Pytest_Script demonstrates clear logical flow: setup fixtures, then individual test cases, then execution notes. Analysis_Summary has no discernible structure beyond basic prose."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Pytest_Script,75,"Lines 85, 95","Pytest_Script has several syntax and logic issues: Line 85 uses 'toArray()' method which doesn't exist in pymongo (should be 'list()'). Line 95 references 'toArray()' again. Some test logic issues: Lines 50-55 expect exceptions for empty documents and missing fields, but MongoDB typically allows these operations. Line 90 expects exception for 'invalid_field' but this wouldn't typically raise an exception in MongoDB. Overall structure and most syntax is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Analysis_Summary,100,N/A,"Analysis_Summary is syntactically correct as prose. No technical syntax errors, proper grammar, and coherent sentence structure. However, it provides no technical implementation to evaluate for correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,N/A,"Average of Pytest_Script (75) and Analysis_Summary (100). Pytest_Script has implementation issues but demonstrates substantial technical content. Analysis_Summary is correct but minimal."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Pytest_Script,N/A,"Lines 85, 95","Fix pymongo syntax errors by replacing 'toArray()' with 'list()' conversion. Review test expectations for empty documents and missing fields - MongoDB may not raise exceptions as expected. Consider adding more robust error handling and validation logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Analysis_Summary,N/A,N/A,"Expand beyond high-level summary to include technical specifications, concrete test cases, implementation details, and actionable migration strategies. Current output lacks sufficient technical depth for practical use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Significant alignment needed between outputs. Pytest_Script should be refined for syntax correctness while Analysis_Summary should be expanded with technical depth matching the implementation detail level of Pytest_Script."
