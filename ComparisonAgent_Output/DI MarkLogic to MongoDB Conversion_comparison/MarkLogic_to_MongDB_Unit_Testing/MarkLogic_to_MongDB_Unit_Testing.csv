Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Agent 1 provides a comprehensive test suite with 10 specific test cases and complete pytest implementation for MongoDB operations. Agent 2 offers only a high-level summary without concrete implementation details. The outputs address similar goals but with vastly different levels of detail and actionability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"","Both outputs address MongoDB testing in migration context. Agent 1 focuses on operational testing with specific CRUD operations, error handling, and performance scenarios. Agent 2 mentions comprehensive analysis including schema mapping and performance considerations but lacks implementation specifics. Moderate semantic alignment due to shared migration testing theme."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,25,"","Agent 1 follows clear structure: test case definitions (lines 1-30) followed by complete pytest implementation (lines 31-95). Agent 2 lacks structured organization, presenting only narrative description without logical decomposition or implementation blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Case_List,95,"Lines 32-95","Python syntax is correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions. Minor deduction for lines 86-87 and 94-95 where exception handling could be more specific (catching generic Exception rather than specific MongoDB exceptions)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Analysis,85,"Lines 1-3","Text is well-formed and grammatically correct. Deduction for lack of concrete deliverables and vague references to 'detailed content' and 'observations above' without actual supporting material."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"","Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 85) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Case_List,,"Lines 86-87, 94-95","Enhance exception handling by catching specific MongoDB exceptions (e.g., pymongo.errors.DuplicateKeyError) instead of generic Exception class for better error diagnostics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Analysis,,"Lines 1-3","Provide concrete implementation details, specific test cases, and actual code examples to match the comprehensive scope claimed in the description."
