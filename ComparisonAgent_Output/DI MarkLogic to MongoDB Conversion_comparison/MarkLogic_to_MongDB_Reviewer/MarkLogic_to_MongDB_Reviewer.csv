Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Both outputs are comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analysis reports with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (88/100). Report_V1 provides a more concise analysis while Report_V2 offers deeper technical detail and validation results. Both demonstrate strong correctness with proper syntax and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All Lines,"Both reports address the same core objective of analyzing MarkLogic to MongoDB migration. They cover identical functional areas: document operations (load, insert, search, update, delete), indexing strategies, and optimization recommendations. The semantic intent and conclusions are highly aligned, with both recommending similar optimization strategies and identifying comparable technical considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50 vs 1-60,"Both reports follow similar logical flow: MarkLogic analysis, MongoDB implementation analysis, comparison, and recommendations. Report_V1 uses a more streamlined 6-section structure while Report_V2 employs a more detailed 6-section approach with numbered subsections. Both maintain consistent hierarchical organization with clear section delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_V1,95,Lines 15-20,"Report_V1 demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. Minor issue: Line 15-20 XML examples could benefit from more complete namespace declarations for full technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_V2,97,Lines 25-30,"Report_V2 shows superior technical accuracy with complete code examples and proper syntax. Very minor formatting inconsistency in BSON structure examples at lines 25-30."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both reports maintain high correctness standards with proper technical terminology, consistent internal references, and well-formed examples. Average correctness score reflects strong technical accuracy across both outputs."
