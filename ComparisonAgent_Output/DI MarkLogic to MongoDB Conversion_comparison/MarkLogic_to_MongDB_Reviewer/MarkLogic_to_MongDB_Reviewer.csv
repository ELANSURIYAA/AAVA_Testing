Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-100,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with similar scope and depth. Output 1 focuses on technical implementation details while Output 2 provides more structured validation results and optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-100,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing MarkLogic to MongoDB migration. They cover identical functional areas (load, insert, search, update, delete operations) and provide similar conclusions about data model conversion, query logic translation, and optimization needs. Minor differences in emphasis and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,1-100,"Both outputs follow similar report structure with sections on MarkLogic analysis, MongoDB implementation, comparison, and recommendations. Output 1 uses 7 main sections while Output 2 uses 6 numbered sections. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations with consistent subsection organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,95,1-100,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper XML/JSON examples, and coherent internal references. Minor issue with incomplete sentence structure in line 45 regarding indexing strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,98,1-100,"Excellent documentation structure with numbered sections, consistent formatting, proper code examples, and complete internal references. All sections are well-formed with clear transitions and comprehensive coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency. Average of individual scores."
