Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of MarkLogic to MongoDB migration with high semantic alignment (92/100), strong structural similarity (88/100), and excellent correctness (95/100 average). Output_1 focuses on systematic analysis with clear recommendations, while Output_2 provides more detailed technical examples and specific performance metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Output_1), Lines 1-60 (Output_2)","Both outputs address the same core migration analysis goal with nearly identical intent. Both cover MarkLogic functions, MongoDB implementation, comparison findings, and recommendations. Minor differences in emphasis: Output_1 focuses more on general optimization strategies while Output_2 includes specific performance metrics (20% improvement mentioned in line 45 of Output_2). Both maintain consistent focus on technical migration aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Output_1), Lines 1-60 (Output_2)","Both follow comprehensive review structure with similar logical flow: source analysis → target implementation → comparison → recommendations → conclusion. Output_1 uses bullet points and clear sections, Output_2 uses numbered sections with embedded code examples. Both maintain hierarchical organization but Output_2 provides more granular subsections (6 main sections vs 5 in Output_1)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,96,"Lines 1-50","Excellent syntax and structure. All sections properly formatted, consistent bullet point usage, proper markdown syntax throughout. Clear hierarchical structure with appropriate heading levels. No broken references or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,94,"Lines 1-60","Very good syntax and structure with minor inconsistencies. Proper numbered sections and code block formatting. Minor issue with inconsistent spacing in code examples (lines 15-20) and slight formatting variation in recommendation numbering (lines 50-55). Overall well-structured with clear organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (96 + 94) / 2 = 95. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and structure."
