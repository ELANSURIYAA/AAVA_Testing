Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-120","Two fundamentally different but complementary outputs addressing MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration. Python_Script provides executable validation code with database connections and CRUD operations. Reconciliation_Report provides analytical documentation with migration challenges and recommendations. Both serve the migration validation goal but through different approaches - implementation vs analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-120","Both outputs address MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration validation but with fundamentally different approaches. Python_Script focuses on technical implementation with executable functions for database operations (lines 5-140). Reconciliation_Report provides strategic analysis with migration challenges and recommendations (lines 10-110). Semantic alignment is low due to different output types - code vs documentation - despite shared migration validation purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-120","Completely different structural approaches. Python_Script follows standard code structure: imports (lines 1-3), function definitions (lines 5-120), main execution (lines 122-150). Reconciliation_Report uses markdown documentation structure: headers, subsections, code examples, bullet points (lines 1-120). No structural overlap between executable code and analytical report formats."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Python_Script,85,"Lines 45, 67, 89, 102","Python syntax is mostly correct with proper imports, function definitions, and MongoDB operations. Issues: Line 45 - ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt variable name contains invalid characters for Python identifiers. Line 67 - Same invalid variable name in function definition. Line 89 - generate_validation_ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt function name invalid. Line 102 - ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt dictionary key invalid. These naming issues would cause syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Reconciliation_Report,95,"Lines 25, 45","Markdown formatting is well-structured with proper headers, code blocks, and lists. Minor issues: Line 25 - XML example could have better indentation. Line 45 - JSON structure formatting could be more consistent. Overall excellent documentation structure with clear sections and proper markdown syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are largely well-formed with minor syntax/formatting issues."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Python_Script,,"Lines 45, 67, 89, 102","Fix variable naming: Replace ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt with valid Python identifier like 'report' or 'validation_report'. Add error handling for database connections. Include logging for validation steps. Add configuration file support for database URIs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Reconciliation_Report,,"Lines 25, 45, 80-90","Improve code example formatting consistency. Add more specific technical details about index migration strategies. Include performance benchmarking methodology. Expand edge case documentation with specific solutions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Consider combining approaches: Use Python_Script as implementation foundation and Reconciliation_Report as planning/analysis framework. Python_Script provides technical execution while Reconciliation_Report offers strategic guidance. Together they form comprehensive migration validation solution."
