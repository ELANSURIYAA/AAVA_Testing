Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Two distinct but complementary outputs addressing MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration validation. Python_Script provides executable code for technical validation while Reconciliation_Report provides strategic analysis and documentation. Both outputs address the same domain but serve different purposes in the migration process."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"","Both outputs address MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration validation but with different approaches. Python_Script focuses on technical implementation with executable functions, while Reconciliation_Report provides analytical documentation. Both share common concepts like CRUD operations, indexing, and validation but diverge in execution method."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"","Fundamentally different structural approaches. Python_Script follows procedural programming structure with function definitions and main execution flow (lines 1-95). Reconciliation_Report uses document structure with hierarchical sections and subsections (lines 1-85). Minimal structural overlap despite addressing same domain."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Python_Script,85,"Line 14, Line 58","Syntax is mostly valid Python with proper imports and function definitions. However, variable name 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' contains invalid characters for Python identifiers (lines 58, 95). Function logic is sound but this naming issue affects correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Reconciliation_Report,95,"Line 45","Well-structured documentation with consistent formatting and valid markdown syntax. Minor issue with incomplete sentence structure in edge cases section (line 45). All code examples and JSON/XML structures are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"","Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Python_Script,,"Line 58, Line 95","Fix variable naming convention by replacing 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' with valid Python identifier like 'validation_report'. Add error handling for database connections and file operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Reconciliation_Report,,"Line 45","Complete the sentence structure in edge cases section. Consider adding more specific technical details about namespace handling implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Consider integrating both outputs - use Python_Script as technical implementation and Reconciliation_Report as accompanying documentation. This would provide comprehensive migration validation solution."
