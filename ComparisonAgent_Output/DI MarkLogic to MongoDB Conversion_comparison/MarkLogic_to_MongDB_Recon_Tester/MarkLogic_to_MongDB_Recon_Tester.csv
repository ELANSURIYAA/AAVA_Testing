Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 (Python_Script), Lines 1-120 (Reconciliation_Report)","Python_Script provides a complete Python validation script with functional code for migration testing, while Reconciliation_Report delivers a comprehensive analytical report with migration strategies and recommendations. Both outputs address MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration but from different perspectives - implementation vs. analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150, Lines 1-120","Both outputs address MarkLogic-to-MongoDB migration validation. Python_Script focuses on practical implementation with executable code for testing migration accuracy, while Reconciliation_Report provides strategic analysis and reconciliation reporting. The core intent aligns (migration validation) but approaches differ significantly - technical implementation vs. analytical assessment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-150, Lines 1-120","Python_Script follows a functional programming structure with defined functions for each operation (connect, parse, load, insert, search, update, delete, validate). Reconciliation_Report uses a report structure with sections for analysis, challenges, recommendations, and validation results. Fundamentally different organizational approaches - code structure vs. document structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Python_Script,85,"Lines 13, 52, 89","Python script has valid syntax overall but contains issues: Line 13 uses undefined 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing' variable name which is invalid Python identifier, Line 52 references same invalid identifier, Line 89 has similar naming issue. MongoDB and XML operations are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Reconciliation_Report,95,"Lines 15-20, 45-50","Report structure is well-formed with proper markdown syntax, consistent formatting, and logical flow. Minor formatting inconsistency in code block indentation around lines 15-20 and 45-50, but overall excellent structural integrity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Python_Script,,"Lines 13, 52, 89","Fix invalid variable naming 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing' to valid Python identifiers. Add error handling for database connections and file operations. Include logging for validation steps."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Reconciliation_Report,,"Lines 15-20, 45-50","Standardize code block formatting for consistency. Consider adding more specific technical implementation details to complement the strategic analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Consider combining approaches: use Python_Script's implementation framework with Reconciliation_Report's comprehensive analysis structure for a complete migration validation solution."
