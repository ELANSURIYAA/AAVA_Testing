Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,97,,"Both '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' and '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' outputs achieve high semantic and structural similarity, with only minor differences in error handling, configuration abstraction, and logging granularity. Both scripts deliver robust, automated ABAP-to-PySpark migration validation with comprehensive reporting and testability. Syntax is correct for both, with only minor style or path-handling differences. Overall, both are production-grade and auditable."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,98,,"Both scripts implement an automated, robust, and auditable validation pipeline for ABAP-to-PySpark migration, including simulated ABAP execution, data conversion, distributed storage, PySpark transformation, and reconciliation reporting. Both cover error handling, logging, and testability, with minor differences in configuration handling and logging verbosity (see lines 17-30 in '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' vs lines 26-70 in '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt'). Both scripts reach identical business outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"17-30, 26-70","Both scripts follow the same validation flow: configuration, ABAP read/simulation, conversion to Parquet, distributed storage transfer, PySpark loading, transformation, result comparison, and reporting. '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt' uses more modular utility functions and abstracts configuration/environment, while '1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt' uses a class-centric approach with direct parameterization. Both are logically decomposed and schedulable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt,100,,"No syntax or reference errors detected. All imports, function calls, and logging are consistent. Paths are hardcoded for demo but valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt,98,"145-150","Minor risk of file path issues when using os.rename for local storage transfer (line 150); otherwise, syntax and references are valid. All imports and error handling are robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of 100 (1.0 1/ABAP_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester.txt) and 98 (2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,,"17-30, 26-70","Both scripts would benefit from aligning configuration management and logging approach for maximum maintainability and auditability. Consider standardizing error handling and file path logic (see lines 145-150 in '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt')."
Recommendations,Recommendation,,"145-150","Replace os.rename with a safer copy method or handle overwrite errors for local file moves in '2.0 1/abap_to_pyspark_recon_tester.txt'."
