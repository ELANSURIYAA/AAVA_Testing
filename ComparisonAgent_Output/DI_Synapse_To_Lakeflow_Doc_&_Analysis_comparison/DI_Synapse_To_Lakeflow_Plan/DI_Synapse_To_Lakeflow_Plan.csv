Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two cost and effort planning documents for Synapse SQL to Lakeflow conversion with identical structure but different data volumes and costs. Agent 1 processes 65GB/run ($975/month, 24hrs effort) while Agent 2 processes 650GB/run ($9750/month, 17hrs effort). Both documents are syntactically correct and semantically aligned in purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All,"Both outputs address identical goal of cost estimation for Synapse to Lakeflow conversion. Same methodology, pricing model ($0.50/compute unit), and effort categories. Minor differences in data volumes and resulting calculations are contextual rather than conceptual divergences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,All,"Nearly identical document structure: header block (lines 1-4), Lakeflow cost estimation (section 1), manual effort estimation (section 2), API processing cost (section 3). Same subsection organization, formatting, and logical flow. Only difference is filename reference in Agent 2 header."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All,"Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations correct: 65GB × 30 days = 1950GB monthly, 1950 × $0.50 = $975, 24hrs × $50 = $1200. No syntax errors, proper formatting, consistent units and currency notation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All,"Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations correct: 650GB × 30 days = 19500GB monthly, 19500 × $0.50 = $9750, 17hrs × $50 = $850. No syntax errors, proper formatting, consistent units and currency notation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All,"Both documents demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with accurate calculations, proper formatting, and internal consistency. No errors detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,All,"Document is production-ready with accurate calculations and clear structure. Consider adding explicit storage cost breakdown if available."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,All,"Document is production-ready with accurate calculations and clear structure. Remove filename reference from description field for cleaner presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both documents demonstrate high quality with excellent structural alignment. The different data volumes appear to represent different project scopes rather than errors. Consider standardizing description field format across similar documents."
