# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two cost and effort planning documents for Synapse SQL to Lakeflow conversion with identical structure but different data volumes and costs. Agent 1 processes 65GB/run ($975/month, 24hrs effort) while Agent 2 processes 650GB/run ($9750/month, 17hrs effort). Both documents are syntactically correct and semantically aligned in purpose.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address the identical goal of cost estimation for Synapse to Lakeflow conversion. They use the same methodology, pricing model ($0.50/compute unit), and effort categories. The minor differences in data volumes and resulting calculations are contextual rather than conceptual divergences. Both documents follow the same cost formula and breakdown structure.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 98/100)

Nearly identical document structure with:
- Header block (lines 1-4) 
- Lakeflow cost estimation (section 1)
- Manual effort estimation (section 2) 
- API processing cost (section 3)

Same subsection organization, formatting, and logical flow. The only structural difference is a filename reference in Agent 2's header description field.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 100/100)**
Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations are correct:
- 65GB × 30 days = 1,950GB monthly
- 1,950 × $0.50 = $975
- 24hrs × $50 = $1,200

No syntax errors, proper formatting, consistent units and currency notation.

**Agent 2 (Score: 100/100)**  
Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations are correct:
- 650GB × 30 days = 19,500GB monthly
- 19,500 × $0.50 = $9,750
- 17hrs × $50 = $850

No syntax errors, proper formatting, consistent units and currency notation.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 98 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **98** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
Document is production-ready with accurate calculations and clear structure. Consider adding explicit storage cost breakdown if available.

**For Agent 2:**
Document is production-ready with accurate calculations and clear structure. Remove filename reference from description field for cleaner presentation.

**For Both:**
Both documents demonstrate high quality with excellent structural alignment. The different data volumes appear to represent different project scopes rather than errors. Consider standardizing description field format across similar documents.
