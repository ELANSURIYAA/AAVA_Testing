Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50 vs 1-40,"Two distinct analysis documents with fundamentally different purposes: DI_Synapse_Pipeline_Analyzer provides comprehensive technical pipeline migration analysis (complexity score 20/100) while DI_Synapse_Pricing_Analyzer focuses solely on pricing and volume context (complexity score 5/100). Semantic similarity is low due to different analytical focuses, structural similarity is moderate due to shared document template, and correctness is high for both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,Lines 1-50 vs 1-40,"The outputs address completely different aspects of Synapse-to-Lakeflow migration. DI_Synapse_Pipeline_Analyzer (lines 1-50) focuses on technical pipeline conversion with stored procedures, transformations, and syntax mapping. DI_Synapse_Pricing_Analyzer (lines 1-40) focuses exclusively on cost modeling and data volumes. While both support migration planning, their semantic purposes diverge significantly - technical implementation vs. financial planning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50 vs 1-40,"Both outputs follow identical document structure template with sections: Pipeline Overview, Complexity Metrics (table format), Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost. The structural alignment is strong despite different content focus. Both use consistent formatting, numbered sections, and tabular complexity metrics presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Synapse_Pipeline_Analyzer,95,Lines 15-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid table structures, and consistent technical terminology. Minor issue: complexity score calculation methodology not fully detailed in lines 15-25."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Synapse_Pricing_Analyzer,98,Lines 20-30,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent structure, and accurate metadata presentation. Very minor formatting inconsistency in complexity metrics table alignment (lines 20-30)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minimal formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Synapse_Pipeline_Analyzer,N/A,Lines 35-50,"Enhance complexity scoring methodology documentation and provide more detailed justification for transformation logic assessment. Consider adding explicit error handling strategies for pipeline migration."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Synapse_Pricing_Analyzer,N/A,Lines 25-40,"Improve table formatting consistency in complexity metrics section. Consider expanding volume handling details to support more granular capacity planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50 vs 1-40,"These outputs serve complementary purposes in migration planning - combine technical pipeline analysis with cost modeling for comprehensive migration strategy. Consider creating integrated documentation that references both technical and financial aspects."
