## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of documenting Azure Synapse to Databricks migration challenges and solutions. They cover identical technical concepts including variable declarations, temporary tables, control flow differences, and optimization strategies. Output 1 focuses on concise technical delivery while Output 2 adds business context and enhanced formatting. 

Key semantic alignments include:
- Procedure purpose (lines 7-12 vs 9-15)
- Complexity metrics coverage (lines 14-35 vs 17-45) 
- Syntax difference identification (lines 37-55 vs 62-85)
- Optimization recommendations (lines 75-85 vs 110-125)

Minor semantic differences include Output 2's additional business objective emphasis and more detailed metric descriptions. Overall intent and technical accuracy are nearly identical.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow a consistent 6-section structure: Procedure Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost. Output 1 uses simple markdown headers and basic table formatting (lines 14-35). Output 2 employs enhanced formatting with horizontal rules, detailed tables, and structured subsections (lines 17-45, 62-85). 

Flow progression is identical in both: overview → metrics → differences → adjustments → optimization → cost. Output 2 includes additional structural elements like business objective callouts (lines 15-16) and more detailed metric descriptions (lines 25-45). The core logical decomposition and information architecture are nearly identical despite presentation differences.

### Correctness

**Output 1 (Score: 95/100):**
Output 1 demonstrates excellent technical accuracy with proper markdown syntax, consistent table formatting, and accurate technical content. All section headers are properly formatted (lines 1, 14, 37, 57, 75, 87). Complexity metrics table is well-structured with accurate counts (lines 16-35). Technical descriptions of T-SQL vs Databricks differences are precise and complete (lines 39-55). Manual adjustment recommendations are technically sound (lines 59-73). Minor issues include basic table formatting that could be enhanced, and some metric descriptions that could be more detailed.

**Output 2 (Score: 95/100):**
Output 2 shows excellent technical accuracy with enhanced markdown formatting, detailed tables, and comprehensive technical content. All section headers use proper markdown with additional formatting elements (lines 1, 17, 62, 87, 110, 127). Complexity metrics table includes detailed descriptions and proper alignment (lines 19-45). Technical syntax differences are accurately documented with clear explanations (lines 64-85). Business context additions are relevant and accurate (lines 15-16). Minor areas for improvement include some verbose descriptions that could be more concise.

**Overall Correctness: 95/100**
