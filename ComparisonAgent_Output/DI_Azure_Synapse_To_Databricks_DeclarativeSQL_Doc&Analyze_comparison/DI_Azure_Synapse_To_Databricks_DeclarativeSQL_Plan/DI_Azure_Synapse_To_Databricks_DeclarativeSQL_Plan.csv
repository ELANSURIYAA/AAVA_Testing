Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two cost estimation outputs for Synapse to Databricks migration. Agent_1 delivered comprehensive analysis with detailed cost breakdowns ($285-420/month runtime, 40 hours total effort), while Agent_2 failed due to environment file parsing error. Significant divergence in output completeness and utility."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Agent_1: Lines 1-85, Agent_2: Lines 1-5","Major semantic divergence. Agent_1 addresses the core task with comprehensive cost estimation, effort analysis, and technical details. Agent_2 acknowledges the same task domain but fails to deliver due to technical error. Both recognize the Databricks migration context but only Agent_1 fulfills the analytical requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Agent_1: Lines 1-85, Agent_2: Lines 1-5","Fundamental structural differences. Agent_1 follows structured analytical format with clear sections (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing, Testing Effort, API Cost). Agent_2 has minimal structure - header block followed by error message. No comparable organizational framework between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 10-12, 28-30","Syntactically well-formed with proper markdown structure, consistent formatting, and valid cost calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in cost breakdown section alignment. All numerical values properly formatted and calculations appear sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,85,"Lines 1-5","Syntactically correct but minimal content. Proper header block format and clear error message structure. Deduction for incomplete delivery despite correct syntax - fails to meet functional requirements of the task."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 85) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective scopes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Excellent comprehensive analysis demonstrating strong domain expertise. Consider adding risk assessment section and sensitivity analysis for cost estimates. Include contingency planning for effort estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Critical failure in task execution. Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. Provide partial analysis when full environment details unavailable. Consider graceful degradation strategies for missing dependencies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Significant quality gap indicates need for standardized validation processes. Implement pre-execution environment checks and dependency validation. Consider implementing backup data sources or estimation methodologies when primary sources fail."
