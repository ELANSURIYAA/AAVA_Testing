Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive Azure Synapse Pipeline documentation for LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. Agent 1 uses markdown formatting with clear section headers and structured tables. Agent 2 uses plain text with numbered sections and similar content organization. Both cover identical functional requirements including data flow, transformations, and complexity analysis with minor differences in presentation style and scoring metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 75-120, 150-200","Both outputs address the same core objective of documenting the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. They share identical understanding of data sources (STG_HOLDING_METRICS), dimension joins (DIM_DATE, DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT), business rules (income_amount transformation), and target table (FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY). Minor semantic differences include Agent 1 emphasizing 'executive reporting' while Agent 2 uses 'enterprise reporting' terminology. Both correctly identify the same transformation logic and data lineage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-25, 50-75, 100-150","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 7 main sections: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Agent 1 uses markdown headers (##) while Agent 2 uses numbered sections (#). Both include the same data mapping table structure with identical column mappings. The flow of information is consistent: staging → transformation → loading → audit → cleanup. Minor structural differences in formatting and section numbering but logical flow remains the same."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 60-80, 120-140","Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate technical references. All SQL references (table names, column names, joins) are syntactically correct. Data lineage table is properly formatted with consistent column headers. Minor issue: API cost format could be more standardized (line 195)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,93,"Lines 45-65, 110-130","Agent 2 shows good syntactic correctness with consistent section numbering and proper table formatting. All technical references are accurate and SQL syntax is correct. Data mapping table maintains proper structure. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in some sections (lines 45-50) and less standardized formatting compared to Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical content, proper table structures, and consistent internal references. Average score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies but no major syntactic errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-25, 195-200","Standardize API cost formatting and consider adding more detailed error handling documentation. The markdown formatting is excellent and should be maintained as the preferred standard."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 40-50, 180-185","Improve section spacing consistency and consider adopting markdown formatting for better readability. The content accuracy is strong but presentation could be enhanced to match Agent 1's formatting standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 150-170","Both outputs would benefit from adding more detailed error handling scenarios and recovery procedures. Consider including performance optimization recommendations and monitoring best practices for the stored procedure execution."
