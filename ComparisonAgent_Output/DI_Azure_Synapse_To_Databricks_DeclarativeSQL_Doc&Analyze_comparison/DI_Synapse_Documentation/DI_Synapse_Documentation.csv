Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive documentation for the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY Azure Synapse stored procedure. The documents demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical core purpose and technical content. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with both following logical documentation patterns, though Agent_1 uses more detailed formatting and Agent_2 employs a cleaner header structure. Correctness scores are excellent for both agents (Agent_1: 98/100, Agent_2: 96/100) with minor formatting inconsistencies. Overall assessment shows both outputs are production-ready with Agent_1 slightly more comprehensive in presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both documents address the identical stored procedure with the same business purpose, data flow, and transformation logic. Core content including data mapping tables, business rules, and complexity analysis are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in descriptive language and emphasis (e.g., 'executive reporting' vs 'enterprise reporting' at lines 15 and 12 respectively) do not impact overall meaning. Both correctly identify the income_amount transformation rule and dimension table joins."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both documents follow similar 7-section structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Agent_1 uses markdown headers with --- separators and more detailed subsection formatting. Agent_2 uses # headers with cleaner organization. Both include identical data mapping tables and complexity metrics tables. Main structural difference is Agent_1's more elaborate header formatting (lines 1-5) versus Agent_2's simpler approach (lines 1-4)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 45-47,"Document is well-formed with consistent markdown formatting and proper table structures. Minor issue: API cost section appears disconnected from main content flow at line 45. All internal references are consistent and table formatting is proper throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,Lines 8-10,"Document structure is clean and well-organized. Minor formatting inconsistency in the author/date header section (lines 8-10) where the structured format could be more consistent. All tables and references are properly formatted and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score reflects both documents' high quality with minor formatting considerations. Both maintain internal consistency and proper technical documentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 45-47,"Consider integrating the API cost information more naturally into the document flow rather than as a disconnected section. The content is comprehensive and well-structured overall."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 8-10,"Standardize the header formatting in the author/date section for improved consistency. Consider adding more detailed subsection formatting similar to Agent_1 for enhanced readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both documents are production-ready and provide excellent technical documentation. Consider establishing a standard template that combines Agent_1's detailed formatting with Agent_2's cleaner header structure for future documentation projects."
