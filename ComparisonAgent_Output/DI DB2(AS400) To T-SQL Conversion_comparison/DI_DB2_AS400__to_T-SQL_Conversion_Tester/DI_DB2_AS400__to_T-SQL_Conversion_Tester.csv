Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive DB2 to T-SQL conversion testing documentation with syntax differences tables, test case specifications, and pytest implementation scripts. The outputs demonstrate high semantic and structural alignment with minor variations in presentation and detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"","Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting DB2 to T-SQL syntax conversion differences and providing comprehensive test coverage. Agent 1 focuses on 14 syntax differences with detailed parameter mapping, while Agent 2 presents the same 14 differences with enhanced notes/manual adjustment column. Both include comprehensive test case coverage for edge cases, error handling, and performance validation. The semantic intent and domain understanding are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"","Both outputs follow identical high-level structure: syntax differences table, test case document, pytest script implementation. Agent 1 uses a 3-column table format (DB2 Syntax, T-SQL Syntax Converted, implicit notes), while Agent 2 uses a 4-column format (DB2 Syntax, T-SQL Syntax, Notes/Manual Adjustment, explicit guidance). Test case tables are structurally identical with same columns and coverage areas. Pytest scripts follow similar organization with fixtures, helper functions, and parameterized tests."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45-47, 89-91","Minor issues: Line 45-47 shows inconsistent parameter naming in syntax table (DEPT_NUMBER vs IN_DEPT). Line 89-91 in pytest script has potential connection string security exposure with hardcoded credentials. Otherwise syntactically correct markdown tables and valid Python code."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,97,"Line 156","Minor issue: Line 156 in pytest script shows potential parameter mismatch in DECIMAL precision (9,2 vs 15,2 in one location). Otherwise excellent syntax correctness across all sections with proper markdown formatting and valid Python code structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,"","Average correctness score reflecting minor syntax inconsistencies in both outputs but overall high quality and syntactic validity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,"","Standardize parameter naming consistency in syntax differences table. Consider using environment variables or configuration files for database connection strings in pytest scripts to improve security."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,"","Verify DECIMAL precision consistency across all procedure parameter references. The enhanced 4-column table format with explicit notes provides better clarity for manual conversion guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"","Both outputs provide excellent comprehensive coverage for DB2 to T-SQL conversion testing. Consider adding performance benchmarking tests and cross-database compatibility validation. The test case coverage is thorough including edge cases, error handling, and transactional isolation."
