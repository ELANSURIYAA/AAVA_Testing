# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents produced comprehensive DB2 to T-SQL conversion testing documentation with syntax differences tables, test case specifications, and pytest implementation scripts. The outputs demonstrate high semantic and structural alignment with minor variations in presentation and detail level. Overall scores show excellent performance with 92/100 overall rating for both agents.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting DB2 to T-SQL syntax conversion differences and providing comprehensive test coverage. Agent 1 focuses on 14 syntax differences with detailed parameter mapping, while Agent 2 presents the same 14 differences with enhanced notes/manual adjustment column. Both include comprehensive test case coverage for edge cases, error handling, and performance validation. The semantic intent and domain understanding are nearly identical.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow identical high-level structure: syntax differences table, test case document, pytest script implementation. Agent 1 uses a 3-column table format (DB2 Syntax, T-SQL Syntax Converted, implicit notes), while Agent 2 uses a 4-column format (DB2 Syntax, T-SQL Syntax, Notes/Manual Adjustment, explicit guidance). Test case tables are structurally identical with same columns and coverage areas. Pytest scripts follow similar organization with fixtures, helper functions, and parameterized tests.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**
Minor issues identified at lines 45-47 showing inconsistent parameter naming in syntax table (DEPT_NUMBER vs IN_DEPT), and lines 89-91 in pytest script with potential connection string security exposure using hardcoded credentials. Otherwise syntactically correct markdown tables and valid Python code.

**Agent 2 (Score: 97/100)**
Minor issue at line 156 in pytest script showing potential parameter mismatch in DECIMAL precision (9,2 vs 15,2 in one location). Otherwise excellent syntax correctness across all sections with proper markdown formatting and valid Python code structure.

**Overall Correctness: 96/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Structural Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Correctness | 95 | 97 | 96 |
| **Overall** | **92** | **92** | **92** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
- Standardize parameter naming consistency in syntax differences table
- Consider using environment variables or configuration files for database connection strings in pytest scripts to improve security

**For Agent 2:**
- Verify DECIMAL precision consistency across all procedure parameter references
- The enhanced 4-column table format with explicit notes provides better clarity for manual conversion guidance

**For Both Agents:**
Both outputs provide excellent comprehensive coverage for DB2 to T-SQL conversion testing. Consider adding performance benchmarking tests and cross-database compatibility validation. The test case coverage is thorough including edge cases, error handling, and transactional isolation.
