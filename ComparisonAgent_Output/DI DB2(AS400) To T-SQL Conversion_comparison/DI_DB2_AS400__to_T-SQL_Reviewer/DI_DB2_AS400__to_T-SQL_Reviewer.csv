Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of DB2 for i (AS/400) to T-SQL conversion with similar core findings. Agent 1 provides more detailed analysis with 85% accuracy rating and extensive documentation, while Agent 2 offers more concise presentation with tabular issue format and set-based optimization focus."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"","Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing DB2 to T-SQL conversion quality. They identify similar issues including NULL handling discrepancies, error handling gaps, cursor inefficiency, and data type precision problems. Both recommend set-based operations and proper error handling. Minor differences in emphasis and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both follow similar review report structure with summary, accuracy assessment, issues identification, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. Agent 1 uses numbered sections with subsections and detailed formatting, while Agent 2 uses simpler structure with tabular issue presentation. Flow and logical progression are comparable but presentation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 27-28, 31-34, 42-44","Excellent technical accuracy with specific line references for issues. Correctly identifies NULL handling differences, incomplete error handling, and precision mismatches. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in issue descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 13-33, 36-44, 39","Strong technical accuracy with systematic tabular issue presentation. Correctly identifies cursor inefficiency and error handling issues. Minor deductions for less specific line referencing in some cases and cursor status check discrepancy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"","Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with accurate identification of conversion issues and appropriate recommendations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 1-44","Implement TRY...CATCH error handling, correct data type precision to DECIMAL(15,2), document NULL handling changes, add input validation, and consider set-based operations for performance improvement."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 13-33, 36-44","Refactor to set-based aggregation, improve error handling by setting both output parameters to NULL, use local cursor status checks, add input validation, and implement SET XACT_ABORT ON for robust error handling."
