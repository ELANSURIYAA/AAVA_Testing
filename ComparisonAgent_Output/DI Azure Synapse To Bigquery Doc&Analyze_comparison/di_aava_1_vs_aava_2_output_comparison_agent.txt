# **AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 WORKFLOW OUTPUT COMPARISON REPORT**

---

## **CRITICAL ERROR: COMPARISON CANNOT BE COMPLETED**

**STARTING COMPARISON BETWEEN AAVA 1.0 AND AAVA 2.0 OUTPUTS**

---

## **1. AGENT SUMMARY TABLE**

| Agent Name 1.0 | Agent Name 2.0 | Matching Score |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| N/A | N/A | 0% |

---

## **2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Overall Status:** ❌ **FAIL**

**Overall Matching Percentage:** **0%**

**Business Logic Equivalency:** **CANNOT BE DETERMINED**

**Summary:**
The comparison process has failed at the input discovery and validation stage. While both required output files have been identified in the directory structure:
- AAVA_1.0_Output.txt
- AAVA_2.0_Output.txt

The system is unable to read the content of these files due to file access errors. Multiple path resolution attempts were made, but all resulted in "No such file or directory" errors despite the files being listed in the directory.

**Root Cause:** File system access issue or permission restriction preventing file content retrieval.

**Impact:** Without access to the actual file contents, no field-level comparison, value matching, or business logic validation can be performed.

---

## **3. COMPARISON SUMMARY**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Fields Compared | 0 |
| Matched Fields | 0 |
| Mismatched Fields | 0 |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 1.0) | Unknown |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 2.0) | Unknown |
| Total Files Compared | 0 of 2 |

---

## **4. MATCHING PERCENTAGE**

**Overall Matching Percentage:** **0%**

**Calculation:**
```
Matching % = (Matched Fields / Total Fields Compared) × 100
Matching % = (0 / 0) × 100 = 0%
```

**Explanation:** No fields could be compared due to inability to access input files.

---

## **5. DETAILED FIELD-LEVEL COMPARISON**

**Status:** ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE**

No field-level comparison could be performed because the input files could not be read.

**Attempted Files:**
- `/src/2afbcfe7-eceb-46c2-821c-0ca2ddbecc1f/AAVA_1.0_Output.txt` - **ACCESS FAILED**
- `/src/2afbcfe7-eceb-46c2-821c-0ca2ddbecc1f/AAVA_2.0_Output.txt` - **ACCESS FAILED**

---

## **6. MISSING DETAILS**

### **Fields Missing in AAVA 1.0:**
Cannot be determined - file content inaccessible.

### **Fields Missing in AAVA 2.0:**
Cannot be determined - file content inaccessible.

---

## **7. VALUE MISMATCHES**

**Status:** Cannot be determined due to file access failure.

| Field Name | AAVA 1.0 Value | AAVA 2.0 Value | Severity | Functional Impact |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

---

## **8. REMARKS**

**Functional Equivalence:** ❌ **CANNOT BE CONFIRMED**

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Both output files exist in the directory structure
- ❌ File content cannot be accessed or read
- ❌ No data normalization performed
- ❌ No field comparison executed
- ❌ No value validation completed

**Risk Assessment:** **CRITICAL**

Without the ability to compare actual workflow outputs, there is **no validation** that AAVA 2.0 produces equivalent results to AAVA 1.0. This represents a critical blocker for:
- Production migration approval
- Quality assurance sign-off
- Business logic validation
- Regression testing confirmation

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Investigate and resolve file system access issues
2. Verify file permissions and path configurations
3. Confirm workflow output files are being generated correctly
4. Re-run comparison agent after file access is restored
5. Do NOT proceed with migration until successful comparison is completed

---

## **9. FINAL VALIDATION STATUS**

**Status:** ❌ **FAIL**

**Justification:**
The comparison process failed at Step 1 (Input Discovery & Validation). Both required input files were identified but could not be read due to file system access errors. Zero fields were compared, resulting in 0% matching percentage, which is below the 90% threshold required for PASS status.

**Production Migration Recommendation:** 🛑 **DO NOT PROCEED**

Migration from AAVA 1.0 to AAVA 2.0 **CANNOT be approved** until:
1. File access issues are resolved
2. Complete comparison is successfully executed
3. Matching percentage meets or exceeds 90% threshold
4. Business logic equivalency is confirmed

## **10. APPENDIX: FILE-LEVEL COMPARISON MATRIX**

| Agent Name | AAVA 1.0 Output File | AAVA 1.0 LOC | AAVA 2.0 Output File | AAVA 2.0 LOC | Matching % |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|
| Unknown | AAVA_1.0_Output.txt | Unknown (File Inaccessible) | AAVA_2.0_Output.txt | Unknown (File Inaccessible) | 0% |

**Note:** LOC (Lines of Code) values could not be determined as files are inaccessible.

---

## **ERROR DETAILS**

**Error Type:** File Access Failure

**Files Affected:**
1. `/src/2afbcfe7-eceb-46c2-821c-0ca2ddbecc1f/AAVA_1.0_Output.txt`
2. `/src/2afbcfe7-eceb-46c2-821c-0ca2ddbecc1f/AAVA_2.0_Output.txt`

**Error Message:** `[Errno 2] No such file or directory`

**Attempted Path Variations:**
- Full absolute path with /src prefix
- Relative path without /src prefix
- Direct filename only
- Path with src/ prefix

**Result:** All attempts failed with the same error.

---

**COMPARISON COMPLETED — STATUS: FAIL**

**Report Generated:** Unable to complete comparison due to critical file access error.

**Next Steps:** Resolve file system access issues and re-execute comparison agent.
