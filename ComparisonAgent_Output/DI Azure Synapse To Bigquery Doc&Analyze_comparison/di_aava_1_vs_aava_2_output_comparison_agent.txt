# **AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 WORKFLOW OUTPUT COMPARISON REPORT**

---

## **CRITICAL ERROR: INPUT VALIDATION FAILURE**

**STARTING COMPARISON BETWEEN AAVA 1.0 AND AAVA 2.0 OUTPUTS**

**STATUS: COMPARISON FAILED - UNABLE TO PROCEED**

---

## **1. AGENT SUMMARY TABLE**

| Agent Name 1.0 | Agent Name 2.0 | Matching Score |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| N/A - File Not Accessible | N/A - File Not Accessible | 0% |

---

## **2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Overall Status:** ❌ **FAIL**

**Overall Matching Percentage:** **0%** (Unable to calculate)

**Business Logic Equivalency:** **CANNOT BE DETERMINED**

**Summary:**
The comparison agent was unable to complete the validation process due to critical input file access errors. Both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 output files were listed in the directory but could not be read. This indicates either:
- Files do not physically exist despite being listed
- File permissions prevent access
- File path resolution issue
- Upstream workflow agents failed to generate outputs

**CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Without access to both output files, no comparison, validation, or equivalency assessment can be performed.

## **3. COMPARISON SUMMARY**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Fields Compared | 0 |
| Matched Fields | 0 |
| Mismatched Fields | 0 |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 1.0) | Unknown |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 2.0) | Unknown |
| Total Files Compared | 0 of 2 |

---

## **4. MATCHING PERCENTAGE**

**Overall Matching Percentage:** **0%**

**Calculation:**
```
Matching % = (Matched Fields / Total Fields Compared) × 100
Matching % = (0 / 0) × 100 = UNDEFINED
```

**Status:** Cannot be calculated due to missing input files.

---

## **5. DETAILED FIELD-LEVEL COMPARISON**

**Status:** No comparison performed.

**Reason:** Input files from AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 could not be accessed.

| Field / Component | AAVA 1.0 Behavior | AAVA 2.0 Behavior | Status | Severity | Reason |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|
| N/A | File not accessible | File not accessible | ERROR | CRITICAL | Input validation failure |

---

## **6. MISSING DETAILS**

### **Fields Missing in AAVA 1.0:**
Cannot be determined - source file not accessible.

### **Fields Missing in AAVA 2.0:**
Cannot be determined - source file not accessible.

---

## **7. VALUE MISMATCHES**

**Status:** No value comparison performed.

| Field Name | AAVA 1.0 Value | AAVA 2.0 Value | Severity | Functional Impact |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Cannot assess - files not accessible |

---

## **8. REMARKS**

### **Functional Equivalence:**
**CANNOT BE CONFIRMED** - No data available for comparison.

### **Key Findings:**
- ❌ Both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 output files are listed in the directory but cannot be read
- ❌ File access errors prevent any validation or comparison
- ❌ Upstream workflow agents may have failed to generate valid outputs
- ❌ No field-level, value-level, or structural comparison could be performed

### **Risk Assessment:**
**CRITICAL RISK** - Without successful comparison, migration from AAVA 1.0 to AAVA 2.0 cannot be validated. Production deployment is **NOT RECOMMENDED** until this blocker is resolved.

### **Root Cause Analysis Required:**
1. Verify upstream agents (AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow execution agents) completed successfully
2. Confirm output files were generated and written to the correct directory
3. Check file permissions and access rights
4. Validate file path resolution in the workflow binding configuration

---

## **9. FINAL VALIDATION STATUS**

**Status:** ❌ **FAIL**

**Justification:**
The comparison agent cannot validate workflow equivalency between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 because the required input files are not accessible. This represents a critical failure in the validation pipeline.

**Production Migration Recommendation:** 
🚫 **DO NOT PROCEED** with migration or production release until:
1. Input file access issues are resolved
2. Both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 outputs are successfully generated
3. This comparison validation is re-executed with valid inputs
4. A passing validation report (≥90% match) is obtained

## **10. APPENDIX: FILE-LEVEL COMPARISON MATRIX**

| Agent Name | AAVA 1.0 Output File | AAVA 1.0 LOC | AAVA 2.0 Output File | AAVA 2.0 LOC | Matching % |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|
| Workflow Output Agent | AAVA_1.0_Output.txt (NOT ACCESSIBLE) | Unknown | AAVA_2.0_Output.txt (NOT ACCESSIBLE) | Unknown | 0% |

**Note:** LOC (Lines of Code) values cannot be determined as files are not accessible.

## **ERROR DETAILS**

**File Listing Result:**
- `/src/fe4a1e20-a8e1-4fcd-aa89-374769756a49/AAVA_1.0_Output.txt` - Listed but not readable
- `/src/fe4a1e20-a8e1-4fcd-aa89-374769756a49/AAVA_2.0_Output.txt` - Listed but not readable

**Error Messages:**
- AAVA 1.0: "Failed to read file... [Errno 2] No such file or directory"
- AAVA 2.0: "Failed to read file... [Errno 2] No such file or directory"

---

**COMPARISON COMPLETED — STATUS: FAIL**

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Investigate why output files cannot be accessed despite being listed
2. Verify upstream workflow agent execution status
3. Re-run workflow with proper file generation validation
4. Re-execute this comparison agent once valid inputs are available
