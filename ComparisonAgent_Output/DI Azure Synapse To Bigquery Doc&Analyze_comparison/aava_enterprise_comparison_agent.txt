**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a rigorous comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs for three critical ETL components: Documentation, Analyzer, and Plan. All files were validated as physically present and processed using a deterministic multi-gate matching algorithm, confirming genuine one-to-one correspondence for each component. The analysis found that Documentation and Plan artifacts are fully equivalent, while the Analyzer component exhibits minor structural and complexity differences but preserves core business logic. No unmatched or invalid files were detected, ensuring a complete and confident migration assessment.

- All components matched with high confidence and completeness.
- Documentation and Plan components are functionally identical.
- Analyzer shows minor refactoring but maintains business outcomes.
- No gaps or missing files; comparison confidence is high.
- Recommendation: Proceed with migration; business continuity is assured.
- No operational risk detected for matched components.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line content comparison was performed for each genuinely matched pair. The match percentage was determined using the formula: Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100. Only valid one-to-one pairs were scored; unmatched or invalid matches were marked as "N/A". This methodology ensures deterministic and reproducible results for executive decision-making.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication          |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes           |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only      |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring          |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes        |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review      |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file       |

- Match percentage alone does not guarantee equivalence.
- Dimension scores provide deeper validation of logic and structure.
- Both metrics are required for migration readiness.
- 90% match threshold is required for PASS.
