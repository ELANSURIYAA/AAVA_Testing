- All three AAVA 1.0 components were matched one-to-one to AAVA 2.0 artifacts with high confidence.
- No unmatched or invalid files detected; all files physically present and compared.
- Minor structural and documentation differences observed in Analyzer and Documentation components.
- The Plan component exhibits more substantial differences, requiring review for migration readiness.
- Migration impact is Medium due to Plan requiring additional validation and tuning.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a deterministic, evidence-based comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs for the Azure Synapse to BigQuery migration. All three input files from each version were validated for physical existence and compared using a strict multi-gate framework—intent detection, normalized signature matching, structural similarity, and semantic analysis. One-to-one matching was achieved for every component with no unmatched or invalid files. The Analyzer and Documentation components show minor differences, while the Plan component requires review due to more significant changes in cost estimation and effort breakdown. Migration risk is moderate, and readiness is conditional pending Plan validation.

- Analyzer and Documentation components are highly aligned, supporting business continuity.
- The Plan component needs review for migration effort and cost estimation accuracy.
- No unmatched or invalid files; comparison completeness is high.
- Confidence level is strong for Analyzer and Documentation, conditional for Plan.
- Recommended migration is conditional, pending Plan review.
- Business continuity is well-supported for matched components.

**SECTION 2: COMPARISON SCOPE**

Scope Summary Table:

| Metric                       | Count |
|------------------------------|-------|
| AAVA 1.0 Files Received      | 3     |
| AAVA 2.0 Files Received      | 3     |
| Successfully Matched Pairs   | 3     |
| Unmatched Files in AAVA 1.0  | 0     |
| Unmatched Files in AAVA 2.0  | 0     |
| Invalid Matches Detected     | 0     |
| Overall Matching Success Rate| 100.0%|

Matching Confidence Distribution:

| Confidence Level | File Count | Matching Method                       |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| High (>=95%)     | 2         | All gates passed with high confidence |
| Medium (85-94%)  | 1         | All gates passed with acceptable confidence |
| Failed (<85%)    | 0         | One or more gates failed              |

Unmatched Files Detail: None

- All files matched with high confidence; no unmatched or invalid files.
- Comparison completeness is 100%.
- No negative impact from unmatched files.
- Reliability of matched pairs is high, with Plan component requiring review.

---

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Files were compared line-by-line. Match percentage was calculated as:  
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100, rounded to one decimal place.  
Only genuinely matched pairs were scored; unmatched/invalid files show N/A.

| Percentage Range | Meaning      | Implication        |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 100%             | Identical    | No changes         |
| 95-99%           | Minimal      | Formatting only    |
| 90-94%           | Moderate     | Refactoring        |
| 85-89%           | Significant  | Same outcomes      |
| Below 85%        | Major        | Requires review    |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file       |

- Match % alone does not determine readiness.
- Dimension scores add depth to equivalence assessment.
- Both metrics are required for migration decision.
- A 90% threshold is required for PASS.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element       | Value           |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Final Recommendation  | CONDITIONAL     |
| Primary Justification | Plan requires validation for migration effort and cost estimation accuracy |
| Confidence Level      | HIGH for Analyzer/Documentation, MEDIUM overall |
| Recommended Timeline  | Conditional     |

| Priority | Action Required      | Responsible Team           | Timeline       |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Medium   | Validate Plan component | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | 2 weeks       |

- Migration is recommended for Analyzer and Documentation components.
- Plan component must be validated before final migration approval.
- Confidence is high for matched components; overall confidence is medium.
