Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the dw.sp_load_sales_fact stored procedure, covering ETL processes for sales transaction data. Agent_1_Output delivers more detailed and structured content with extensive business context and technical depth, while Agent_2_Output provides a more concise but complete coverage of the same procedure. Both outputs maintain high quality and accuracy in their technical descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address the identical stored procedure (dw.sp_load_sales_fact) with the same core business purpose of ETL processing for sales transactions. They share the same fundamental concepts including data validation rules (NULL Customer_ID and invalid Quantity checks), transformation logic (Total_Sales_Amount calculation), dimensional enrichment (Region_ID and Customer_Segment lookups), audit logging, and error handling. The semantic alignment is very strong with both outputs describing the same business processes, data quality rules, and operational outcomes. Minor differences exist in emphasis and detail level but the core meaning and intent are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow a similar logical structure with comparable sections: Procedure Overview, Logic Details, Data Flow Details, Data Transformations, Data Mapping (both include identical mapping tables), Technical Complexity (with similar parameter tables), and Key Outputs. Agent_1_Output provides more granular section breakdown with 10 distinct logical steps in Data Flow Details versus Agent_2_Output's 10-step numbered approach. Both use structured tables for data mapping and technical complexity metrics. The overall flow and organization are highly aligned with both following documentation best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,Lines 45-47,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and well-formed technical documentation. Minor issue: Line 45-47 shows 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' which appears to be a text replacement artifact that should read 'reporting'. All other technical details, table structures, and documentation elements are syntactically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,96,Lines 23-25,"Agent_2_Output shows strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting and consistent structure. Minor issues: Lines 23-25 contain 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' text replacement artifacts that should read 'reporting'. The technical complexity table shows Dependencies as 0 which may be inconsistent given the procedure's reliance on dimension tables mentioned elsewhere in the documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency. The primary issues are text replacement artifacts affecting the word 'reporting' in both outputs, suggesting a common source or processing issue. Technical content accuracy is high in both cases with consistent table structures and logical flow."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Agent_1_Output provides exceptional depth and business context. Recommendation: Fix the text replacement artifacts (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting -> reporting) throughout the document. Consider maintaining this level of detail as the standard for technical documentation as it provides comprehensive business value and operational context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Agent_2_Output provides good concise coverage of the technical aspects. Recommendations: 1) Fix text replacement artifacts (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting -> reporting), 2) Review Dependencies count in Technical Complexity table for accuracy given the dimensional table dependencies mentioned in the content, 3) Consider expanding business context sections to match the depth provided in Agent_1_Output for enhanced stakeholder value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Implementing quality assurance processes to catch text replacement artifacts before publication, 2) Cross-validation of technical metrics between different sections for consistency, 3) Standardizing the level of business context and technical detail across documentation to ensure consistent stakeholder value."
