Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Comprehensive comparison of two documentation outputs for dw.sp_load_sales_fact stored procedure. Agent_1_Comprehensive provides extensive detail with 75+ sections and comprehensive business context. Agent_2_Concise delivers focused technical content with streamlined presentation. Both documents are technically accurate and structurally sound, with Agent_1_Comprehensive offering superior depth for enterprise documentation needs while Agent_2_Concise provides efficient technical reference material."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,All Lines,"Both outputs address the identical stored procedure (dw.sp_load_sales_fact) with consistent core purpose and ETL functionality. Agent_1_Comprehensive provides extensive business context, organizational value propositions, and detailed explanations of each processing step. Agent_2_Concise covers the same technical concepts but with streamlined descriptions. Key semantic alignment includes: identical procedure name, same data flow concepts (validation, transformation, loading), consistent table names and column mappings, aligned technical complexity metrics, and matching audit/logging approaches. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent_1_Comprehensive focuses heavily on business value and compliance aspects while Agent_2_Concise prioritizes technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,All Lines,"Excellent structural alignment with both documents following nearly identical organization patterns. Both use: Procedure Overview section, Logic Details section, Data Flow Details with numbered steps, Data Transformations section, Data Mapping tables with identical column headers, Technical Complexity metrics table, and Key Outputs section. Agent_1_Comprehensive includes additional subsections like 'Business Purpose' and 'Organizational Value' within overview, more detailed step-by-step breakdowns (10 steps vs 10 steps), and expanded explanations within each section. Agent_2_Concise maintains the same logical flow but with more concise presentations. The data mapping tables are structurally identical with same column headers and similar row organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Comprehensive,98,Lines 45-47,"Highly accurate documentation with proper formatting and consistent internal references. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 45-47 where 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be a placeholder or encoding issue that should read 'reporting'. All table structures are properly formatted, technical details are accurate, and cross-references are consistent throughout the document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Concise,99,All Lines,"Excellent technical accuracy with clean formatting and consistent structure throughout. All table formats are properly aligned, technical specifications match the procedure requirements, and no formatting or reference inconsistencies detected. Documentation maintains professional standards with clear section delineation and accurate technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Both documents demonstrate high correctness standards with only minor formatting issues in Agent_1_Comprehensive. Technical accuracy is excellent across both outputs with proper table structures, consistent terminology, and accurate procedure specifications."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 1-200,"Ideal for enterprise documentation repositories requiring comprehensive business context and detailed explanations. Recommend addressing the formatting inconsistency with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' placeholder text. Consider this format for stakeholder presentations, training materials, and compliance documentation where detailed business justification is required."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Concise,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Excellent for technical reference documentation and developer handbooks. The concise format is optimal for quick reference during development and maintenance activities. Recommend this approach for technical teams who need efficient access to procedure specifications without extensive business context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both documents serve complementary purposes in a complete documentation strategy. Agent_1_Comprehensive for business stakeholders and comprehensive records, Agent_2_Concise for technical teams and operational reference. Consider maintaining both formats or creating a hybrid approach that includes expandable sections for different audience needs."
