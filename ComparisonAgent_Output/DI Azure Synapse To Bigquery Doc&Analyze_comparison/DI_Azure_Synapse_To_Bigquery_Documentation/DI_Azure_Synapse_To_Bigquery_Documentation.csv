Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation for the dw.sp_load_sales_fact stored procedure. Agent_1_Output delivers more detailed business context and organizational value propositions, while Agent_2_Output provides a more concise but equally accurate technical description. Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment (92/100), nearly identical structural organization (95/100), and excellent syntactic correctness (100/100 each). The documentation quality is high for both agents, with Agent_1_Output excelling in business context and Agent_2_Output providing clearer technical summaries. Overall assessment shows both outputs are production-ready with complementary strengths."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All Lines,"Both outputs describe the same ETL stored procedure with highly aligned meaning and intent. Agent_1_Output provides extensive business context including organizational value, compliance requirements, and business intelligence enablement (lines 15-25). Agent_2_Output covers the same core concepts more concisely but with equal technical accuracy (lines 8-15). Both describe identical data validation rules, transformation logic, and audit capabilities. Minor differences include Agent_1_Output's emphasis on regulatory compliance and Agent_2_Output's focus on operational efficiency. The semantic alignment is strong with both addressing the same business problem and technical solution."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,All Lines,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with the same major sections in the same order. Both use: Procedure Overview, Logic Details, Data Flow Details (10 steps in Agent_1_Output vs 10 steps in Agent_2_Output), Data Transformations, Data Mapping (identical table structure), Technical Complexity (identical table format), and Key Outputs. Agent_1_Output includes additional subsections for Business Purpose and Organizational Value (lines 12-25), while Agent_2_Output maintains a more streamlined structure. The data mapping tables are identical in format and content. The logical flow and decomposition approach are virtually the same."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,All Lines,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, valid table structures, and no syntax errors. All technical references are accurate including table names (dw.Fact_Sales, stg.Sales_Transactions), column names, and SQL operations. The documentation follows consistent formatting standards with proper section headers, bullet points, and table structures. No broken references or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,All Lines,"Agent_2_Output shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate technical references, and consistent structure. All table names, column names, and technical details are correctly formatted and referenced. The data mapping table structure is identical to Agent_1_Output and syntactically perfect. Documentation follows consistent formatting with proper headers and organization. No syntax errors or broken references identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All Lines,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or technical inaccuracies. The documentation is well-structured, internally consistent, and follows proper formatting standards."
