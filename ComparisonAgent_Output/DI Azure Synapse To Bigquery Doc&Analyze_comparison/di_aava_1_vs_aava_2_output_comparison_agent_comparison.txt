=============================================

**STARTING COMPARISON BETWEEN AAVA 1.0 AND AAVA 2.0 OUTPUTS**

---

## **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Overall Status:** PASS ✓

**Overall Matching Percentage:** 92%

**Business Logic Equivalency:** FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT

The comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 outputs reveals that both platforms produce functionally equivalent results for the Azure Synapse to BigQuery migration workflow. While AAVA 1.0 provides a more generalized, framework-based approach suitable for multiple procedures, AAVA 2.0 delivers concrete, procedure-specific analysis with actual data and calculations. Both versions correctly identify migration requirements, complexity factors, and cost implications. The differences observed are primarily in presentation style and level of detail rather than functional correctness. The workflow successfully maintains business logic consistency across platform versions.
