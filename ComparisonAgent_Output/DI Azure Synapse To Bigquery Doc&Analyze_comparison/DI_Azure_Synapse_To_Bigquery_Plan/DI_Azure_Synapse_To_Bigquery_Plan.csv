Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,Lines 1-347,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for BigQuery conversion of sales fact ETL procedures. Detailed_Analysis offers extensive breakdown with 6 operation categories and risk factors (276-347 hours), while Concise_Analysis provides streamlined approach with focused manual fixes (9.25 hours). Semantic alignment is strong on core concepts but differs significantly in scope and granularity. Structural approaches vary from detailed tabular breakdowns to simplified narrative format. Both outputs demonstrate technical correctness with proper BigQuery cost calculations and realistic effort estimations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-50 vs 1-20,"Both outputs address BigQuery conversion cost estimation using $5.00/TB pricing model and similar data volume assumptions (1.95TB total, 200-500GB processing). Core semantic concepts align: data quality validation, audit logging, temporary table conversion, and system function replacements. However, Detailed_Analysis emphasizes comprehensive operation-level breakdown with 6 distinct cost categories, while Concise_Analysis focuses on simplified per-run estimates. Semantic divergence occurs in effort estimation scope - Detailed_Analysis projects 276-347 hours with extensive testing phases, while Concise_Analysis estimates 9.25 hours for core fixes only."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,Lines 51-200 vs 21-80,"Structural approaches differ significantly. Detailed_Analysis employs hierarchical organization with numbered sections (1.1, 2.1), detailed tables, and categorical breakdowns. Uses formal cost breakdown tables and comprehensive effort matrices. Concise_Analysis uses simplified section structure with bullet points and streamlined presentation. Both follow logical flow from cost estimation to effort analysis, but Detailed_Analysis includes additional sections for risk factors, monthly projections, and contingency planning. Structural similarity exists in core organization but diverges in depth and presentation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Analysis,95,Lines 60-120,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate mathematical calculations. Cost calculations are precise ($0.35 + $0.175 + $0.475 + $0.50 + $0.025 + $0.015 = $1.54). Effort estimations show detailed breakdown with realistic hour allocations across 7 major categories. Minor formatting inconsistency in one table header alignment (line 180)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Concise_Analysis,92,Lines 25-70,"Well-structured with consistent formatting and accurate cost calculations ($1.00-$2.50 range aligns with processing estimates). Effort breakdown is logically organized with clear hour allocations. Mathematical accuracy maintained throughout. Minor inconsistency in section numbering format (2.1 appears twice at lines 28 and 35)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate calculations, proper formatting, and logical consistency. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies but overall technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Analysis,85,Lines 300-347,"Leverage comprehensive breakdown approach for complex enterprise migrations requiring detailed stakeholder communication and risk assessment. The extensive testing framework (132-166 hours) provides robust quality assurance suitable for mission-critical systems. Consider the detailed cost operation breakdown for accurate budget planning and resource allocation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Concise_Analysis,80,Lines 75-85,"Utilize streamlined approach for straightforward conversions with experienced BigQuery teams. The focused 9.25-hour estimate is suitable for tactical migrations with clear scope boundaries. Effective for proof-of-concept or pilot implementations where comprehensive testing phases may be handled separately."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,82,,"Both approaches offer value depending on project context. Detailed_Analysis excels for enterprise-grade migrations requiring comprehensive documentation and stakeholder buy-in. Concise_Analysis provides practical efficiency for experienced teams with clear conversion requirements. Consider hybrid approach: use Detailed_Analysis framework for planning and Concise_Analysis execution estimates for agile delivery."
