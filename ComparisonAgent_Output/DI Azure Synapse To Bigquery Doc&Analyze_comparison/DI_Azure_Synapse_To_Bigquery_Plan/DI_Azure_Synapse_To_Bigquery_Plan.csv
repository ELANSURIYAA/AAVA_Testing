Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-347 (Agent 1), Lines 1-109 (Agent 2)","Both outputs successfully address BigQuery conversion cost estimation and effort analysis for sales fact ETL procedures. Agent 1 provides comprehensive detailed analysis with granular cost breakdowns and extensive effort estimates (276-347 hours), while Agent 2 offers a more streamlined approach with focused estimates (9.25 hours). The semantic alignment is strong with both addressing the same core requirements, though structural approaches differ significantly in depth and granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (both agents)","Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in addressing BigQuery conversion requirements. Agent 1 provides detailed cost breakdown ($1.54 realistic estimate) with operation-specific analysis, while Agent 2 offers range-based estimates ($1.00-$2.50). Both cover essential elements: runtime costs, effort estimation, and testing requirements. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses on comprehensive analysis while Agent 2 prioritizes practical implementation steps."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-20, 51-100, 200-250 (Agent 1), Lines 1-15, 25-50, 80-109 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Cost Estimation and Effort Estimation sections. However, Agent 1 employs detailed hierarchical breakdown (1.1, 2.1 subsections, tables, risk analysis) while Agent 2 uses simplified numbering (2.1, 2.1). Agent 1 includes comprehensive tables and risk factors absent in Agent 2. Structural flow is logically consistent in both but with significantly different granularity levels."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45-60, 150-180, 280-320","Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and well-organized hierarchical sections. Minor issues: some redundant calculations in lines 45-60, and slight inconsistency in effort hour ranges (276-347 vs 320-420 in lines 280-320). All mathematical calculations are accurate and properly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 25-35, 70-85, 95-105","Agent 2 shows strong syntactic correctness with clean formatting and logical structure. Minor issues include: incomplete metadata header (missing creation date in lines 1-5), slight inconsistency in cost range presentation (lines 25-35), and abbreviated effort breakdown that could benefit from more detailed justification (lines 70-85). All core calculations are mathematically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"All lines reviewed","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate calculations, and logical structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies and presentation variations rather than fundamental errors. Both outputs are technically sound and professionally structured."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,90,"Lines 200-347","Agent 1 excels in comprehensive analysis and detailed cost breakdowns. Recommend maintaining the thorough approach while streamlining presentation. Consider consolidating redundant calculations and creating executive summary tables for key metrics. The risk analysis and contingency planning are valuable additions that should be preserved."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,88,"Lines 50-109","Agent 2 provides excellent practical focus and implementation clarity. Recommend expanding the effort breakdown with more detailed justification for the 9.25-hour estimate. Consider adding risk factors and contingency planning similar to Agent 1. The streamlined approach is valuable but could benefit from more comprehensive cost analysis granularity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,89,"All sections","Both outputs would benefit from hybrid approach: Agent 1's comprehensive analysis depth combined with Agent 2's practical clarity. Recommend standardizing cost presentation format, adding executive summary sections, and ensuring consistent metadata headers. Consider creating unified template that captures both detailed analysis and practical implementation focus."
