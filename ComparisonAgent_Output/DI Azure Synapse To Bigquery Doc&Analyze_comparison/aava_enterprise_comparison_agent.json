PROCESSING & INTELLIGENT MATCHING\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nExtract all files from both input archives automatically.\r\n\nApply 4-level intelligent matching strategy:\r\n\nLevel 1: Direct Name Match\r\n\n- Match files with identical or similar base names (case-insensitive)\r\n\n- Confidence: 100%\r\n\nLevel 2: Component Role Recognition\r\n\n- Detect component type by keywords:\r\n\n  * Converter/Conversion: \"convert\", \"converter\", \"conversion\", \"transform\"\r\n\n  * Unit Test: \"unittest\", \"unit_test\", \"test\", \"testing\"\r\n\n  * Reconciliation: \"recon\", \"reconciliation\", \"validation\"\r\n\n  * Review: \"review\", \"reviewer\", \"quality\"\r\n\n  * Analysis/Tester: \"analysis\", \"analyzer\",

The analysis covers documentation, technical complexity, and migration planning. All key business logic, data flow, and audit requirements are preserved across both versions. Minor differences are limited to formatting, complexity scoring, and cost breakdown granularity. The migration recommendation is positive, with no material risks identified. The comparison confirms the readiness of AAVA 2.0 for production migration, ensuring business continuity and compliance.\n\n- The most significant finding is complete preservation of business logic and audit traceability.\n- Key strengths include robust validation, comprehensive documentation, and clear migration planning.\n- No material concerns or risks were identified in the comparison.\n- Overall confidence in migration safety is high.\n- Recommendation: Proceed with migration to AAVA 2.0.\n- Expected business continuity is assured with zero disruption.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 2: COMPARISON SCOPE**\n\n| Metric                    | Count |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| AAVA 1.0 Files Received   | 3     |\n| AAVA 2.0 Files Received   | 3     |\n| Successfully Matched Pairs| 3     |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 1.0 | 0   |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 2.0 | 0   |\n| Overall Matching Success Rate | 100.0% |\n\n| Confidence Level | File Count | Matching Method Used                |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n| High (90-100%)   | 3         | Direct name match, role recognition |\n| Medium (70-89%)  | 0         | Content similarity analysis         |\n| Low (50-69%)     | 0         | Alphabetical sequential pairing     |\n\n- All files were matched with high confidence using direct name and role recognition.\n- The comparison coverage is complete; no files were left unmatched.\n- File pairing accuracy is verified at 100% confidence.\n- No unmatched files; both archives are fully synchronized in component structure.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**\n\nFiles are compared line-by-line to detect additions, removals, and changes. Unchanged lines are counted and divided by the total line count to compute the match percentage. This metric reflects the proportion of unchanged content, with higher percentages indicating greater similarity. Dimension scores evaluate quality aspects on a 0-10 scale, providing a deeper assessment beyond raw content similarity.\n\n| Percentage Range | Meaning             | Implication                        |\n|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 100%             | Files are identical| No changes whatsoever              |\n| 95-99%           | Minimal differences| Formatting or minor structure only |\n| 90-94%           | Moderate changes   | Refactoring, equivalent logic      |\n| 85-89%           | Significant changes| Substantial, same outcomes         |\n| Below 85%        | Major differences  | Requires detailed review           |\n\n- Match percentage alone is not sufficient for migration approval.\n- Dimension scores provide deeper quality and functional assessment.\n- Both metrics together determine migration readiness and safety.\n- PASS threshold is set at 90% for confident migration decisions.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 4: DIMENSION-BASED COMPARISON**\n\n| Dimension                      | What Was Compared                     | Result     | Score (0-10) |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Business / Functional Logic     | Core business rules and calculation outcomes | Match      | 10           |\n| Code / Syntax Accuracy          | Technical correctness and modern standards   | Match      | 10           |\n| Data Flow & Transformations     | Data processing and transformation logic     | Match      | 10           |\n| Conditional / Control Logic     | Decision-making and branching structures     | Match      | 10           |\n| Error Handling Strategy         | Exception management and validation          | Match      | 9            |\n| Performance Patterns            | Efficiency and optimization approaches       | Match      | 9            |\n| Unit Test Coverage              | Test completeness and quality                | Match      | 9            |\n| Output Structure & Modularity   | Code organization and maintainability        | Match      | 9            |\n| Documentation Quality           | Comments and explanatory content             | Match      | 10           |\n| End-to-End Functional Equivalence| Overall functional alignment                | Match      | 9            |\n| OVERALL DIMENSION SCORE         | -                                           | -          | 95/100       |\n\n- Four dimensions achieved perfect scores, confirming functional and technical equivalence.\n- Dimensions scoring 9 reflect minor structural or complexity scoring differences.\n- Strongest capability is business logic and data quality preservation.\n- No weaknesses;
