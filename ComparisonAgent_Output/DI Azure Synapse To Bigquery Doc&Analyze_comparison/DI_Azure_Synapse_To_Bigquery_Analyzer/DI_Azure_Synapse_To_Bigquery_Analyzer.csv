Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse stored procedure conversion to BigQuery. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation offers more detailed business context and optimization strategies, while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer provides structured metrics and technical transformation details. Both demonstrate strong understanding of ETL processes and conversion requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs address the same stored procedure dw.sp_load_sales_fact with similar understanding of ETL objectives, data quality validation, and BigQuery conversion requirements. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation provides deeper business context and comprehensive optimization strategies (lines 15-25, 95-120), while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer focuses on structured technical metrics and transformation patterns (lines 20-45, 70-85). Both identify key conversion challenges including function replacements, error handling, and temporary table management. Minor divergence in emphasis: Documentation agent prioritizes business alignment and optimization, Analyzer agent emphasizes technical transformation metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,All Lines,"Both outputs follow similar 5-section structure: Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation uses more detailed subsections with comprehensive coverage (lines 10-15, 30-50, 80-95), while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer employs concise tabular format with structured metrics (lines 25-50, 55-70). Documentation agent includes additional business objective elaboration and advanced BigQuery features discussion. Analyzer agent uses more standardized metric presentation. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation,95,Lines 40-45 65-70,"Syntactically correct with comprehensive technical accuracy. Minor imprecision in complexity score methodology (line 42: complexity score 75 vs detailed metrics suggesting lower complexity). All function mappings, data type conversions, and BigQuery syntax references are accurate. Business logic analysis is thorough and technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer,92,Lines 35-40 75-80,"Syntactically correct with good technical accuracy. Minor inconsistency in complexity scoring (line 38: score 65 with moderate classification vs metrics suggesting higher complexity). Some metric values appear conservative compared to detailed analysis provided. All syntax differences and transformation patterns are accurately identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness and internal consistency. Average score reflects minor methodology inconsistencies in complexity assessment but overall strong technical accuracy in conversion analysis."
