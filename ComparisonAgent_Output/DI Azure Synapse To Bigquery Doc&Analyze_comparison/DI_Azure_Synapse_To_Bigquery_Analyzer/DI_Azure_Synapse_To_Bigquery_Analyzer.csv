Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse stored procedure dw.sp_load_sales_fact for BigQuery conversion. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation offers more detailed business context and complexity analysis (complexity score 75), while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer provides cleaner tabular presentation and structured metrics (complexity score 65). Both identify key conversion challenges including function replacements, error handling restructuring, and optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objective of analyzing Azure Synapse to BigQuery conversion. Key semantic alignments: ETL procedure analysis, data quality validation focus, audit logging requirements, dimensional lookup handling. Divergences: DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation emphasizes business objectives and workflow sessions more extensively (lines 15-25), while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer focuses on technical transformation patterns (lines 10-20). Both correctly identify same source tables, transformations, and target outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-200,"Both follow identical 5-section structure: Procedure Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques. Structural differences: DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation uses narrative subsections with detailed explanations (lines 30-80), while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer employs consistent tabular formatting throughout (lines 25-70). Flow logic similar but presentation approaches differ significantly in density and formatting style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Documentation,92,Lines 45-50,"Minor formatting inconsistencies in complexity metrics table structure. Some table alignment issues in lines 45-50 where metric values don't perfectly align with headers. Otherwise syntactically sound with proper markdown formatting and consistent section numbering."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Analyzer,95,Lines 1-200,"Clean and consistent formatting throughout. Well-structured tables with proper alignment and clear delineation. Consistent use of markdown formatting, bullet points, and section headers. No significant syntactic issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minor formatting variations."
