Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Two comprehensive Azure Synapse to BigQuery conversion analysis reports were compared. Both outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (88/100) with shared objectives of analyzing the dw.sp_load_sales_fact stored procedure for BigQuery migration. Structural similarity is strong (82/100) with both following a 5-section analytical framework, though differing in detail depth and presentation style. Correctness scores are excellent for both agents (Agent_1: 95/100, Agent_2: 92/100, Overall: 94/100) with minor formatting inconsistencies. Agent_1 provides more comprehensive metrics and detailed recommendations, while Agent_2 offers a more concise, business-focused approach. Both outputs are technically sound and provide valuable migration guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,All sections,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing Azure Synapse stored procedure dw.sp_load_sales_fact for BigQuery conversion. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Shared understanding of ETL workflow complexity and business purpose, (2) Consistent identification of syntax conversion requirements (SYSDATETIME to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NEWID to GENERATE_UUID), (3) Similar recognition of manual adjustment needs for error handling and temporary tables, (4) Aligned optimization recommendations focusing on partitioning and BigQuery-native features. Minor semantic divergences: Agent_1 emphasizes technical complexity scoring (75/100) while Agent_2 focuses on moderate complexity (65/100), and Agent_1 provides more granular transformation counts versus Agent_2's streamlined categorization."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Sections 1-5,"Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: (1) Procedure Overview, (2) Complexity Metrics, (3) Syntax Differences, (4) Manual Adjustments, (5) Optimization Techniques. Structural alignments include consistent section ordering and logical flow from analysis to recommendations. Key differences: Agent_1 uses detailed tabular metrics presentation with 12+ complexity dimensions, while Agent_2 employs streamlined table format with essential metrics only. Agent_1 provides extensive sub-categorization within sections (High-Complexity Areas, Business Logic Review Areas), whereas Agent_2 maintains linear narrative flow. Both conclude with refactor vs rebuild recommendations, though Agent_1 provides more detailed justification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Excellent technical accuracy with minor formatting inconsistencies. Issues identified: (1) Line 15-20 complexity metrics table contains some inconsistent value formatting, (2) Minor markdown table alignment issues in optimization section, (3) One instance of incomplete sentence structure in business logic review. Strengths include: comprehensive technical terminology usage, accurate Azure Synapse to BigQuery function mappings, consistent internal cross-references, and proper markdown formatting throughout majority of document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 25-30,"Strong technical accuracy with minor structural issues. Issues identified: (1) Lines 25-30 complexity metrics table has inconsistent value alignment, (2) Some abbreviated technical explanations could benefit from expansion, (3) Minor inconsistency in data type conversion examples. Strengths include: clear and concise technical language, accurate function mapping examples, consistent section formatting, and proper business context integration throughout analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Combined correctness assessment shows both outputs maintain high technical accuracy and proper documentation standards. Average score reflects minor formatting and presentation issues that do not impact technical validity or usability of the migration guidance provided."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 1-150,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed metrics and technical depth. Recommendations: (1) Standardize complexity metrics table formatting for improved readability, (2) Consider adding executive summary section for business stakeholders, (3) Enhance cross-referencing between sections for better navigation. Strengths to maintain: thorough technical coverage, detailed optimization strategies, and comprehensive manual adjustment guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 1-100,"Strong concise analysis with good business focus. Recommendations: (1) Expand on technical implementation details for complex transformations, (2) Add more specific line-by-line conversion examples, (3) Include estimated effort/timeline guidance for migration activities. Strengths to maintain: clear business context, streamlined presentation, and practical optimization focus."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All,"Both outputs provide valuable BigQuery migration guidance with complementary strengths. Consider combining Agent_1's technical depth with Agent_2's business clarity for optimal migration documentation. Both correctly identify refactoring as preferred approach over complete rebuild, demonstrating sound technical judgment for enterprise migration scenarios."
