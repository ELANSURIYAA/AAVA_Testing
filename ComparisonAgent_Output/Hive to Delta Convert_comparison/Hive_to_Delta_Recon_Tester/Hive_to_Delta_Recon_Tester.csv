Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two Python scripts for Hive to Delta Lake migration with significant differences in implementation approach, error handling, and production readiness. Agent 1 provides basic functionality while Agent 2 offers enterprise-grade features."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150 (both)","Both scripts address the same core objective of Hive to Delta migration and validation. However, Agent 1 focuses on basic data transfer while Agent 2 includes comprehensive logging, error handling, and production features. The SQL queries have minor syntax differences but equivalent semantic intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 10-50, 80-120","Both follow similar high-level structure with connection, query execution, export, and comparison phases. However, Agent 2 has significantly more modular design with extensive configuration management, logging setup, and error handling that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,70,"Lines 23, 67, 89","Syntax issues include undefined variable 'Hive_to_Delta_Recon_Tester.csv' on line 23, missing error handling for database connections, and potential issues with subprocess calls without proper validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,85,"Lines 45, 167, 201","Minor syntax issues include potential token exposure in logging on line 167, and some variable naming inconsistencies. Overall structure is sound with comprehensive error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,78,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Agent 2 demonstrates significantly better practices but both have room for improvement."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Fix undefined variable 'Hive_to_Delta_Recon_Tester.csv' on line 23, add comprehensive error handling for all database operations, implement proper logging mechanism, and add input validation for all external calls."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Remove potential token exposure in logging statements, standardize variable naming conventions, add more granular error recovery mechanisms, and consider adding unit tests for critical functions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both scripts would benefit from configuration file management, enhanced data validation logic, and more robust comparison algorithms that handle edge cases like null values and data type differences more effectively."
