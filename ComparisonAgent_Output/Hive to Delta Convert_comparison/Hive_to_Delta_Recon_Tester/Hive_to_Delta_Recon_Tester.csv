Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs implement Hive to Delta Lake migration and validation workflows with data comparison capabilities. Agent 2 provides significantly more comprehensive error handling, logging, and configuration management compared to Agent 1's basic implementation. Key differences include enhanced security practices, detailed validation steps, and robust file integrity checking in Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both scripts address the same core objective of migrating Hive data to Delta Lake with validation. They implement similar logical workflows: Hive connection and query execution, data export to Parquet format, Databricks transfer, external table creation, Delta query execution, and result comparison. The main semantic difference lies in Agent 2's additional focus on production-ready features like comprehensive logging, error handling, and security practices, while Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both scripts follow function-based organization with similar high-level flow. Agent 1 uses simpler structure with basic functions (lines 12-45), while Agent 2 implements more sophisticated architecture with configuration management (lines 18-42), enhanced error handling throughout, and modular design. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like logging setup, environment variable validation, and comprehensive file integrity checking that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,65,"Lines 28, 29, 30","Agent 1 contains several syntax and logical issues: undefined variable 'Hive_to_Delta_Recon_Tester.csv' used as filename (lines 28-30), inconsistent variable naming, and missing error handling for critical operations. The script structure is syntactically valid Python but contains logical errors that would prevent successful execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,"Line 109","Agent 2 demonstrates much better syntax and structure with comprehensive error handling, proper variable definitions, and consistent naming conventions. Minor concern: hardcoded token visible in Spark configuration (line 109) which poses security risk. Otherwise, the script follows Python best practices with proper exception handling and logging."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,77,"","Average of individual agent correctness scores. Agent 2 significantly outperforms Agent 1 in syntax correctness and code quality, bringing the overall average to acceptable levels despite Agent 1's issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,"Lines 28-30, Throughout","Agent 1 requires immediate fixes for undefined variables and improved error handling. Recommend adding comprehensive logging, environment variable validation, and proper exception handling throughout the script. Consider adopting Agent 2's architectural patterns for production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,"Line 109, Security practices","Agent 2 should remove hardcoded credentials from configuration and implement proper secrets management. Consider adding more detailed data validation steps and enhanced comparison metrics. The script is otherwise well-structured and production-ready."
