Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case implementations for Hive to Delta conversion testing. Output1 uses more detailed test case descriptions with explicit expected outcomes, while Output2 provides more concise descriptions but includes additional implementation details in the pytest script. Both cover similar testing scenarios including edge cases, boundary conditions, and error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Output1), Lines 1-45 (Output2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing SQL query logic for sales data analysis. They cover identical scenarios: date filtering, join validation, revenue calculation, aggregation logic, ranking, top-N selection, empty tables, NULL handling, boundary dates, and duplicate handling. Minor differences in test case naming (TC001 vs TC01) and description detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-10 (test cases), Lines 51-150 (pytest scripts)","Both follow similar structure with numbered test cases followed by pytest implementations. Output1 uses more verbose test case descriptions with explicit 'Expected Outcome' sections. Output2 has more concise descriptions but includes additional setup complexity in pytest. Both use similar CTE structure in SQL queries but different data setup approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,92,"Lines 60-65, 85-90","Minor syntax issues: inconsistent schema definition in sales_data fixture (line 60-65), and potential issues with date handling in boundary test cases (line 85-90). Otherwise syntactically correct with proper pytest structure and SQL syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,88,"Lines 35-40, 180-185, 220-225","Several syntax issues: inconsistent data structure in setup_tables function (lines 35-40), potential schema mismatch in sales_data setup (lines 180-185), and incomplete error handling in invalid data types test (lines 220-225). SQL syntax is correct but pytest implementation has some inconsistencies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are largely syntactically correct with minor implementation issues that could be easily resolved."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Standardize schema definitions in fixtures and improve date handling consistency in boundary test cases. Consider adding more explicit assertions for revenue calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Fix data structure inconsistencies in setup_tables function, resolve schema mismatches in test data setup, and improve error handling in exception test cases. Consider adding more detailed test case descriptions for better documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized naming conventions, 2) More comprehensive assertion statements, 3) Better separation of test data setup, 4) Addition of performance test cases for large datasets, 5) Integration with actual Delta table operations rather than just SQL logic testing."
