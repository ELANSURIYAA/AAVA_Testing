Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1), Lines 1-200+ (Agent_2)","Both agents provide comprehensive unit testing solutions for Hive to Delta conversion with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent_1 offers a solid foundation with 10 test cases and basic pytest structure. Agent_2 provides more detailed implementation with comprehensive test logic, better error handling, and more realistic test scenarios. Key differences include implementation depth, fixture sophistication, and test coverage completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10 vs 1-10 (test cases), Lines 15-50 vs 15-200 (pytest)","Both agents target the same core objective of testing Hive to Delta conversion logic with similar test case concepts. Agent_1 focuses on basic validation scenarios while Agent_2 provides more comprehensive business logic testing. Both cover filtering, joins, aggregations, and edge cases but with different levels of detail and implementation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-50 vs 15-200 (pytest structure)","Both follow pytest conventions with fixtures and test functions. Agent_1 uses simpler fixture structure while Agent_2 implements more sophisticated setup with helper functions and comprehensive test implementations. Both organize tests logically but Agent_2 provides better separation of concerns and more maintainable code structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,78,"Lines 20-25 (fixture issues), Lines 35-40 (incomplete assertions)","Agent_1 has valid Python syntax but contains incomplete test implementations. The sales_data fixture has inconsistent schema definition, and several test functions lack proper assertions. The SQL query structure is correct but test validation is minimal."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 50-60 (minor schema inconsistencies), Lines 180-190 (exception handling)","Agent_2 demonstrates strong Python and pytest syntax with comprehensive test implementations. Minor issues include some schema inconsistencies in test data setup and one test case that may not properly handle exceptions. Overall structure and logic are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,"Combined assessment","Average correctness score reflecting Agent_1's basic but incomplete implementation and Agent_2's comprehensive and well-structured approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 35-50","Complete test implementations with proper assertions, enhance fixture data quality, add more comprehensive edge case testing, and improve test documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 50-60, 180-190","Address minor schema inconsistencies in test data, improve exception handling in edge cases, and consider adding performance testing scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Overall structure","Agent_2 provides a more production-ready testing framework. Agent_1 should adopt Agent_2's comprehensive approach to test implementation and data setup patterns."
