Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive test case lists and pytest scripts for validating a Delta/Hive SQL query. Agent2_TestCases demonstrates superior implementation with better structure, more complete test fixtures, and proper error handling. Agent1_TestCases provides good conceptual coverage but has implementation gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs target the same SQL validation goals with similar test scenarios. Agent1_TestCases covers core functionality (filtering, joins, calculations, ranking) with test cases TC001-TC010. Agent2_TestCases covers identical scenarios with TC01-TC10 but provides more detailed expected outcomes and edge case handling. Minor differences in test case descriptions and expected outcome specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by pytest script. Agent1_TestCases uses simpler linear approach with basic test functions. Agent2_TestCases employs more sophisticated structure with fixtures (lines 12-16), helper functions (lines 18-25), and modular test organization. Agent2 demonstrates better separation of concerns and reusability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_TestCases,70,"Lines 45-48, 52-55","Pytest script has incomplete schema definitions in fixtures. Sales_data fixture (line 45) has inconsistent tuple structure with 6 elements but schema has 6 names. Some test functions reference undefined variables or have incomplete assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_TestCases,90,"Lines 85-90, 125-130","Well-structured pytest implementation with proper fixtures and helper functions. Minor issues with data setup in some test cases where schema consistency could be improved. Overall syntactically sound with good error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,80,"","Average of individual agent scores. Agent2_TestCases significantly more correct in implementation while Agent1_TestCases has conceptual correctness but implementation gaps."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_TestCases,,"Lines 45-55","Improve pytest script structure by adding proper fixtures, completing schema definitions, and implementing comprehensive assertions. Consider adopting modular approach similar to Agent2_TestCases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_TestCases,,"Lines 85-90","Minor refinements needed in data setup consistency. Consider adding more explicit assertions for edge cases. Overall excellent implementation that could serve as template."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Agent2_TestCases provides superior implementation and should be preferred. Both agents could benefit from additional integration test scenarios and performance validation test cases."
