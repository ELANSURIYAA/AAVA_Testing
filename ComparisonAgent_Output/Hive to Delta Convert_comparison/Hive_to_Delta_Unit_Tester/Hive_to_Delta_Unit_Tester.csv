Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive test coverage for Hive to Delta conversion SQL query testing. Agent1_TestCaseList offers detailed descriptive test cases with clear expected outcomes, while Agent2_PytestScript provides executable pytest implementations. Agent1 achieves higher correctness due to complete specifications, while Agent2 provides practical implementation but with some syntax issues."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Agent1: Lines 1-30, Agent2: Lines 1-200","Both outputs target the same core testing requirements: filtering sales data for last 12 months, validating joins, checking revenue calculations, verifying ranking logic, and handling edge cases. Agent1 provides more comprehensive edge case coverage (TC007-TC010) while Agent2 focuses on implementable test scenarios. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent1 is specification-focused while Agent2 is implementation-focused."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Agent1: Lines 1-30, Agent2: Lines 35-200","Agent1 uses structured list format with consistent test case ID, description, and expected outcome pattern. Agent2 follows pytest framework conventions with fixtures, setup functions, and test methods. Both progress logically from basic functionality to edge cases, but use fundamentally different organizational structures - descriptive vs executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_TestCaseList,95,"Lines 1-30","Well-formed test case specifications with clear IDs, comprehensive descriptions, and specific expected outcomes. Minor deduction for TC008 which could be more specific about NULL handling behavior."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_PytestScript,75,"Lines 45-50, 85-90, 120-125, 160-165","Multiple syntax and implementation issues: incomplete schema definitions in fixtures (lines 45-50), inconsistent data structure in setup_tables function (lines 85-90), malformed sales_data tuples in test_happy_path (line 120-125), and incomplete test assertions in several test methods (lines 160-165)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,"","Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 75) / 2 = 85"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_TestCaseList,,"Lines 15-20","Consider adding more specific assertions for TC008 NULL handling behavior and include performance testing scenarios for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_PytestScript,,"Lines 45-200","Fix schema consistency issues in fixtures, complete test assertions in all test methods, resolve data structure mismatches in setup functions, and add proper error handling for invalid data type tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Combine approaches: use Agent1's comprehensive test case specifications as requirements and Agent2's pytest framework as implementation foundation. Ensure all edge cases from Agent1 are properly implemented in executable format."
