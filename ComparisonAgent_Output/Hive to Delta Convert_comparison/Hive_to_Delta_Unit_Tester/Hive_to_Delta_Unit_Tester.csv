Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents successfully generated comprehensive test case suites for Delta/SQL analytics validation. Agent 1 provided a solid foundation with 10 test cases and basic pytest implementation. Agent 2 delivered more detailed and production-ready test implementations with better data setup and comprehensive assertions. Overall alignment is strong with Agent 2 showing superior implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: validating Delta SQL query logic for sales analytics including filtering (12-month window), joins (sales-products-regions), revenue calculations, aggregations, and ranking. Agent 1 focuses on basic validation scenarios while Agent 2 provides more comprehensive edge case coverage. Minor divergence in test case naming conventions (TC001 vs TC01) and implementation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by pytest implementation. Agent 1 uses simpler fixture setup (lines 15-45) while Agent 2 employs more sophisticated helper functions (lines 12-25). Agent 1 has basic test structure while Agent 2 implements comprehensive test logic with proper data setup, query execution, and detailed assertions. Control flow and decomposition approaches are aligned but implementation complexity differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,"Lines 28, 35, 42","Syntax is valid but has several issues: 1) Line 28 - sales_data fixture creates DataFrame with inconsistent schema expectations, 2) Line 35 - products_data and regions_data fixtures lack proper column definitions, 3) Line 42 - test_filtered_sales function has incomplete assertion logic, 4) Missing proper error handling and edge case validations in test implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 45, 78","Syntax is largely correct with minor issues: 1) Line 45 - sales_rows transformation could be simplified, 2) Line 78 - some test functions have incomplete schema definitions in comments. Overall implementation is robust with proper fixture setup, comprehensive test logic, and appropriate error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting Agent 1's basic but functional implementation and Agent 2's more robust and production-ready code structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,"Lines 28-45, 60-80","Enhance fixture definitions with proper schema validation, implement comprehensive assertion logic in test functions, add error handling for edge cases, and improve test data setup consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,"Lines 45, 120-140","Simplify data transformation logic where possible, add more detailed comments for complex test scenarios, and consider parameterized tests for similar test cases to reduce code duplication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of Delta/SQL testing requirements. Agent 2 provides superior implementation quality and should be preferred for production use. Consider combining Agent 1's clear test case documentation style with Agent 2's robust implementation approach for optimal results."
