Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Delta_Script_Agent and HiveHQL_Session_Agent successfully convert Hive SQL to Delta format with nearly identical semantic intent and structural approach. Both outputs implement the same business logic: filtering sales data for the last 12 months, calculating revenue metrics by category and region, ranking categories, and selecting top 3 performers per region. Key differences include date function usage (DATE_ADD vs DATEADD), data type specifications (DECIMAL vs NUMERIC), join syntax (INNER JOIN vs JOIN), and documentation depth. Overall assessment shows high semantic and structural similarity with excellent syntactic correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business requirements with same logical flow and transformations. Minor semantic differences in date calculation approach: Delta_Script_Agent uses 365-day lookback while HiveHQL_Session_Agent uses 12-month lookback, which may yield slightly different results for leap years or varying month lengths. Both achieve the same analytical objective with equivalent window functions and aggregations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,N/A,"Nearly identical structural decomposition using same CTE names and logical flow. Both use FilteredSales -> CategoryRevenue -> RankedCategories -> Final SELECT pattern. Minimal structural differences in join syntax (INNER JOIN vs JOIN) and formatting style. HiveHQL_Session_Agent includes additional overview comments but maintains same code organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Delta_Script_Agent,95,Lines 8-9,"Syntactically correct SQL with proper CTE structure, valid joins, and window functions. Minor consideration: DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -365) uses day-based calculation which may not align perfectly with business month-based reporting periods."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,HiveHQL_Session_Agent,98,N/A,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper Delta SQL syntax. Uses DATEADD(month, -12, CURRENT_DATE) which is more semantically appropriate for business reporting. NUMERIC data type and comprehensive documentation enhance code quality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with valid SQL structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Delta_Script_Agent,N/A,Lines 8-9,"Consider using DATEADD(month, -12, CURRENT_DATE) instead of DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -365) for more accurate month-based business reporting. Add comprehensive documentation similar to HiveHQL_Session_Agent to improve code maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,HiveHQL_Session_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Excellent implementation with proper Delta syntax and comprehensive documentation. Consider standardizing join syntax to INNER JOIN for explicit clarity, though current JOIN syntax is functionally equivalent."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs successfully achieve the conversion objective with high quality. For production deployment, recommend adopting HiveHQL_Session_Agent's documentation approach and date calculation method while maintaining the structural clarity both solutions demonstrate."
