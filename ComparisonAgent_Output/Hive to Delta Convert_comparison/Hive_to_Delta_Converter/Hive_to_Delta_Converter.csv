Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents successfully converted Hive SQL to Delta format with identical semantic intent and structural approach. Delta_Script_Agent uses DATE_ADD with -365 days while HiveHQL_Sales_Agent uses DATEADD with -12 months. Both outputs are syntactically correct and functionally equivalent with minor platform-specific differences in date functions and data types."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 10-11 (Delta_Script_Agent), Lines 12-13 (HiveHQL_Sales_Agent)","Both outputs have identical semantic intent: filter sales data for last 12 months, calculate category revenue by region, rank categories, and select top 3. Minor semantic difference in date filtering approach: Delta_Script_Agent uses 365-day lookback while HiveHQL_Sales_Agent uses 12-month lookback, which may handle month boundaries differently."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-45 (both agents)","Nearly identical structural approach with same CTE names (FilteredSales, CategoryRevenue, RankedCategories), same logical flow, and same final SELECT structure. Only minor differences in JOIN syntax (INNER JOIN vs JOIN) and comment placement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Delta_Script_Agent,98,"Line 9, Line 11","Syntactically correct SQL with proper CTE usage, valid joins, and correct window functions. Minor consideration: DECIMAL(10,2) and DATE_ADD(-365) are valid but DATE_ADD with negative values might be less readable than DATEADD."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,HiveHQL_Sales_Agent,100,N/A,"Syntactically perfect SQL with proper CTE usage, valid joins, correct window functions, and clean formatting. NUMERIC data type and DATEADD function usage are appropriate for Delta platform."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both outputs are highly correct with only minor stylistic considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Delta_Script_Agent,N/A,"Line 11","Consider using DATEADD(day, -365, CURRENT_DATE) instead of DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -365) for better readability and consistency with modern SQL practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,HiveHQL_Sales_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive documentation and appropriate Delta-specific adaptations. No significant improvements needed."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-5 (both agents)","Both agents could benefit from consistent comment formatting and explicit documentation of platform-specific function choices for future maintenance."
