Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two test case documents and pytest implementations for Hive to Delta conversion testing. Agent_1 provides 6 basic test cases with minimal pytest implementation, while Agent_2 delivers 10 comprehensive test cases with complete pytest scripts. Both outputs target the same SQL query validation but differ significantly in depth, coverage, and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing a Delta Lake query with CTEs for sales data analysis. Agent_1 focuses on basic functional validation (lines 1-47 in test cases, lines 49-89 in pytest). Agent_2 provides comprehensive edge case coverage including boundary conditions, error handling, and data quality scenarios (lines 1-84 in test cases, lines 86-245 in pytest). The semantic intent aligns on query validation but diverges in testing philosophy - Agent_1 takes a minimal approach while Agent_2 emphasizes thorough coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. Agent_1 uses numbered test cases (TC001-TC006) with standard fields (lines 3-47), while Agent_2 uses tabular format (TC01-TC10) with identical field structure (lines 3-84). Pytest structure differs significantly - Agent_1 has basic fixtures and 2 test functions (lines 49-89), Agent_2 implements comprehensive fixture setup, helper functions, and 10 detailed test cases (lines 86-245). The logical flow is similar but implementation depth varies substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 49, 63, 78","Syntax is generally correct with valid Python and SQL. Minor issues: Line 49 missing comma in builder chain, Line 63 hardcoded assertion count without clear justification, Line 78 incomplete comment about additional test cases. The SQL query structure is valid and the pytest fixtures are properly defined."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Line 95, 158","Excellent syntax quality with comprehensive implementation. Minor issues: Line 95 potential schema mismatch in regions table (missing region_name column referenced in original query), Line 158 exception handling test may be too broad. All other syntax elements are correct including proper fixture usage, SQL query structure, and assertion logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical implementation with Agent_2 showing superior attention to detail and comprehensive coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 49, 63, 78, 89","Fix syntax issues in builder chain (line 49), justify hardcoded assertions (line 63), complete implementation comments (line 78), and expand test coverage to include edge cases like null handling, boundary dates, and error conditions (line 89)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 95, 158, 200","Address schema consistency in regions fixture (line 95), refine exception handling specificity (line 158), and consider adding performance benchmarking tests for large datasets (line 200). Overall excellent implementation that could serve as a template for comprehensive testing."
