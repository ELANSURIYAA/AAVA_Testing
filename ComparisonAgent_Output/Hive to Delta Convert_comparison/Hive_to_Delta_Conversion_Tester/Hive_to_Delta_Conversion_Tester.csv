Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation for a Hive to Delta conversion SQL query testing framework. Agent 1 delivers 6 focused test cases with basic pytest implementation, while Agent 2 provides 10 comprehensive test cases covering edge cases with advanced pytest fixtures and error handling. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage and professional testing practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Agent 1: Lines 1-45, Agent 2: Lines 1-120","Both outputs target the same core SQL query testing objectives: filtering sales data for last 12 months, validating joins between sales/products/regions tables, checking revenue calculations, validating aggregations, and verifying ranking logic. Agent 1 focuses on basic happy path scenarios while Agent 2 extends to comprehensive edge cases including boundary conditions, null handling, empty datasets, and tie-breaking scenarios. The semantic intent is highly aligned but Agent 2 provides broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Agent 1: Lines 1-45 (numbered list), Agent 2: Lines 1-25 (table format)","Both outputs follow standard test case documentation patterns but with different structural approaches. Agent 1 uses numbered list format with explicit field labels (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, etc.) while Agent 2 uses tabular format with columns. Both include pytest scripts but Agent 2 employs professional fixture patterns and modular setup functions. The core structure is similar but presentation and organization differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 47-95","Agent 1 pytest script has valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct fixture definitions, and executable test functions. Minor issues include basic assertion patterns and limited error handling. The SQL query structure in tests is syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 27-180","Agent 2 pytest script demonstrates excellent Python practices with proper fixture scoping, modular setup functions, comprehensive test scenarios, and appropriate error handling with pytest.raises. All SQL queries are syntactically valid and the test logic is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python code, proper SQL syntax, and executable test frameworks. Agent 2 shows slightly superior code quality and testing practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Expand test coverage to include edge cases such as boundary date conditions, null value handling, empty datasets, and tie-breaking scenarios. Consider adopting tabular format for better readability and implement fixture patterns for better test organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding more detailed inline documentation for complex test scenarios and potentially group related test cases into test classes for better organization. The current implementation serves as a strong foundation for production testing."
