Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Two comprehensive code review reports comparing Hive to Delta SQL conversion. Concise_Review provides a streamlined 6-section analysis while Detailed_Review offers extensive technical depth with code samples and specific optimization recommendations. Both reach identical conclusions about conversion accuracy and functional parity, with minor differences in presentation depth and technical detail coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15, 20-35","Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Hive to Delta SQL conversion accuracy and identifying discrepancies. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both confirm conversion accuracy and functional parity, (2) Both identify same discrepancies (date filtering via ADD_MONTHS vs DATE_ADD/DATEADD, window clause removal), (3) Both conclude scripts are ready for deployment. Semantic divergence: Detailed_Review provides deeper technical context with actual code samples and more granular analysis of data types, error handling, and performance considerations that Concise_Review mentions only briefly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs follow nearly identical 6-section structure: (1) Summary, (2) Conversion Accuracy, (3) Discrepancies and Issues, (4) Optimization Suggestions, (5) Overall Assessment, (6) Recommendations. Logical flow and section ordering are consistent. Minor structural differences: Detailed_Review includes code blocks and subsection headers within sections, while Concise_Review uses bullet points. Both maintain professional report formatting with clear section delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Concise_Review,95,"Lines 8-12, 25-30","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting and proper section structure. Minor issues: (1) Line 8 - uses 'DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -365)' in description but actual Delta code uses 'DATEADD(month, -12, CURRENT_DATE)' creating potential confusion, (2) Line 25 - states 'no further changes required' but could benefit from acknowledging the optimization suggestions mentioned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Review,98,"Lines 45-50","Highly accurate and well-structured documentation with proper code formatting, consistent terminology, and comprehensive coverage. Minor issue: Lines 45-50 - mentions 'API Cost Consumed: 2 tool calls' which appears to be metadata that could be separated from the main report content for clarity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and professional documentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Concise_Review,N/A,"Lines 35-40","Enhance report by: (1) Clarifying date function discrepancy description to match actual code implementation, (2) Providing more specific optimization guidance beyond 'no further changes required', (3) Adding validation steps for edge cases mentioned in assessment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Review,N/A,"Lines 180-200","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider: (1) Separating API cost metadata from main report content, (2) Prioritizing recommendations by impact/effort matrix, (3) Adding estimated timeline for suggested optimizations, (4) Including specific test cases for validation scenarios mentioned."
