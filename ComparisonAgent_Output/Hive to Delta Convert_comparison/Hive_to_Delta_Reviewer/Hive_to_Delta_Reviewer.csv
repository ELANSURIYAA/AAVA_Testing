Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two Hive to Delta SQL conversion review reports were analyzed. Agent 1 provides a concise 6-section summary focusing on conversion accuracy and optimization. Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive 6-section analysis with detailed code comparisons, specific technical recommendations, and thorough discrepancy analysis. Both agents correctly identify the core conversion elements but differ significantly in depth and technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core task of reviewing Hive to Delta SQL conversion. Both identify key conversion elements: date filtering differences, data type mapping, window clause optimization, and overall conversion accuracy. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more detailed technical analysis including specific code examples, edge case considerations, and comprehensive optimization recommendations. The semantic intent aligns but depth varies substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both follow a 6-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. Agent 1 uses a concise bullet-point approach while Agent 2 employs detailed subsections with code blocks and comprehensive analysis. The logical flow is similar but presentation depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 10-15, 20-25","Agent 1 correctly identifies key conversion elements: date filtering (ADD_MONTHS vs DATE_ADD), window clause optimization, and functional equivalence. Minor issue: states 'DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -365)' but this should reference the actual Delta syntax used. All technical assessments are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 50-100, 150-180","Agent 2 provides syntactically correct code examples for both Hive and Delta implementations. Correctly identifies DATEADD vs ADD_MONTHS differences, DECIMAL vs NUMERIC mapping, and window clause variations. Comprehensive technical accuracy with proper SQL syntax throughout. Minor formatting inconsistencies in code block presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy in identifying conversion elements and SQL syntax differences. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive technical validation with actual code examples."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 45-50","Agent 1 provides appropriate high-level recommendations for deployment readiness but lacks specific technical guidance for optimization implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 180-200","Agent 2 offers comprehensive actionable recommendations including validation strategies, data quality enhancements, Delta-specific optimizations (partitioning, ZORDER), and performance monitoring guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent 2 provides superior actionable guidance with specific technical recommendations. Agent 1 offers basic deployment readiness assessment. For enterprise implementation, Agent 2's comprehensive approach is more valuable."
