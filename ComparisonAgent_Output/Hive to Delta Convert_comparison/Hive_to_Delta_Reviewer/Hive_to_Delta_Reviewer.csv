Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both agents produced code review reports for Hive to Delta SQL conversion analysis. Agent 1 delivered a concise 6-section summary format, while Agent 2 provided comprehensive analysis with actual code samples and detailed technical comparisons. Both maintain professional documentation standards but differ significantly in depth and analytical rigor."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 3-6 (Agent 1), Lines 15-25 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Hive to Delta SQL conversion accuracy. They share similar conclusions about conversion success and functional parity. However, Agent 2 provides substantially more detailed technical analysis with actual code comparisons, while Agent 1 offers high-level assessments. Both identify similar technical issues (date filtering, window clauses) but with different levels of specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both follow logical review report structure with summary, accuracy assessment, issues identification, and recommendations. Agent 1 uses 6 numbered sections with brief subsections. Agent 2 employs detailed sectioned approach with code blocks, comparison tables, and extensive technical analysis. The overall flow is similar but implementation depth varies significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 10-15, 20-25","Agent 1 demonstrates proper report structure, consistent formatting, and accurate technical observations. Minor issue: lacks specific code examples to support claims about date filtering differences (lines 10-15). All sections are well-formed and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 30-80, 120-150","Agent 2 shows excellent technical accuracy with proper SQL syntax in code blocks, detailed comparison methodology, and comprehensive analysis. Very minor formatting inconsistency in section dividers (lines 120-150). All technical claims are well-supported with evidence."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper documentation structure and accurate technical content. Agent 2 slightly superior due to comprehensive evidence-based analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 40-50","Suitable for executive-level summaries and quick technical reviews. Recommend enhancing with specific code examples and more detailed technical analysis for comprehensive reviews."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 150-200","Excellent for detailed technical reviews and implementation guidance. Recommend maintaining this level of detail for complex conversion projects. Consider adding executive summary section for stakeholder communication."
