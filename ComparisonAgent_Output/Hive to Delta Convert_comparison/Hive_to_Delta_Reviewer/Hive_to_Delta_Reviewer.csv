Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two code review reports analyzing Hive to Delta SQL conversion were compared. The Concise_Reviewer provided a streamlined 6-section analysis while the Comprehensive_Reviewer delivered an extensive 6-section report with detailed code comparisons, optimization suggestions, and thorough recommendations. Both reports address the same conversion task but differ significantly in depth and analytical rigor."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-200","Both outputs analyze the same Hive to Delta SQL conversion task and reach similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and functional parity. However, Comprehensive_Reviewer provides much deeper semantic analysis including actual code comparisons, specific technical details about date functions and data types, and comprehensive business impact assessments. Concise_Reviewer covers the same semantic territory but with significantly less detail and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,80,"Section headers 1-6 vs Section headers 1-6","Both reports follow identical 6-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. The logical flow and section ordering are nearly identical. Main structural difference is that Comprehensive_Reviewer includes actual code blocks, detailed subsections, and API cost tracking, while Concise_Reviewer maintains the same structure but with condensed content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Concise_Reviewer,95,"Lines 1-50","Report is well-formed with proper section headers, consistent formatting, and clear narrative flow. Minor issue: API cost format is inconsistent with standard reporting (shows as single line rather than structured format). All internal references are consistent and no broken formatting detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Reviewer,98,"Lines 1-200","Excellent document structure with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, well-formatted code blocks with syntax highlighting, and comprehensive cross-references. API cost tracking is properly documented. Very minor formatting inconsistency in the final separator line length."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Concise_Reviewer,,"Enhance report depth by including actual code comparisons, specific line-by-line analysis, and detailed technical specifications. Add structured API cost tracking and more comprehensive optimization suggestions to match industry standards for code review documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Reviewer,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach while standardizing formatting consistency. Consider adding executive summary metrics and quantitative analysis sections. The detailed approach sets excellent standards for thorough code review documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents successfully identified the core conversion requirements and provided accurate assessments. For future iterations, consider establishing consistent formatting standards and depth requirements to ensure all reviews meet the comprehensive standard demonstrated by the Comprehensive_Reviewer."
