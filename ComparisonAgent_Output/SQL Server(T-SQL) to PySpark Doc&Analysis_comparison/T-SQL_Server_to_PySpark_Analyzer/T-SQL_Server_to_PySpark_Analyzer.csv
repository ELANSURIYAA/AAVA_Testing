Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Analysis of T-SQL to PySpark conversion documentation. Only one complete agent output was provided (uspAPIPatchAccount analysis), making direct comparison impossible. The available output demonstrates comprehensive analysis of T-SQL stored procedure conversion complexity, syntax differences, and PySpark optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one complete agent output provided in input data. Multiple file paths listed but content available for only one analysis session."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - insufficient data for comparison. Single output shows well-structured analysis with clear sections: Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpbvjwdpxj,85,Lines 1-250,"Available output shows strong technical accuracy in T-SQL analysis. Correctly identifies 15+ syntax differences, appropriate complexity score of 65/100, and valid PySpark conversion recommendations. Minor deduction for incomplete cost calculation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpfnhsxzgn,0,N/A,"No content available for second agent output to evaluate correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,42,N/A,"Average of available scores: (85 + 0) / 2 = 42.5, rounded to 42"

Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpbvjwdpxj,,"Strong technical analysis provided. Recommend maintaining this level of detail in T-SQL to PySpark conversion documentation. Consider adding more specific code examples for complex transformations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpfnhsxzgn,,"No output available for evaluation. Recommend ensuring complete agent outputs are provided for meaningful comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Future comparisons require complete outputs from both agents. Current analysis limited by insufficient input data. Recommend providing full agent outputs with clear content boundaries for accurate evaluation."
