Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Unable to perform complete comparison - only one agent output clearly identified in input. The provided input contains a T-SQL stored procedure analysis document but lacks a second distinct agent output for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without two distinct agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without two distinct agent outputs to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpbvjwdpxj,85,1-250,"T-SQL analysis document shows good structure with clear sections, proper formatting, and comprehensive coverage of stored procedure analysis including complexity metrics, syntax differences, and conversion recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpfnhsxzgn,0,,"Second agent output not clearly identifiable in provided input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,42,,"Average of available correctness scores."
