Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Comparison between tmpbvjwdpxj (file path list) and uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__aei_a25a (detailed T-SQL analysis). The outputs represent fundamentally different types of content - one being a simple list of temporary file paths, the other being a comprehensive technical analysis of a stored procedure. This creates significant challenges for meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1 vs Lines 1-200+","The semantic similarity is extremely low. tmpbvjwdpxj contains only temporary file path identifiers with no business logic or technical content, while uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__aei_a25a provides comprehensive analysis of T-SQL stored procedure functionality, complexity metrics, syntax differences, and conversion recommendations. The outputs address completely different purposes and domains."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-200+","Structural similarity is minimal. tmpbvjwdpxj follows a simple list format with repetitive file path entries, while uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__aei_a25a follows a structured analytical report format with numbered sections, subsections, metrics, and detailed technical explanations. The organizational approaches are fundamentally incompatible."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpbvjwdpxj,95,"Lines 1-150","The file path list appears syntactically correct as a list of valid Unix-style file paths. All entries follow consistent naming patterns and directory structures. No syntax errors detected in the path formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__aei_a25a,98,"Lines 1-200+","The technical analysis document is well-structured with proper formatting, accurate T-SQL syntax references, appropriate complexity scoring methodology, and comprehensive coverage of conversion considerations. Minor deduction for some assumptions about PySpark equivalents that may need validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpbvjwdpxj,,"Lines 1-150","Consider providing actual file content rather than just file path listings to enable meaningful comparison and analysis. The current output lacks substantive content for technical evaluation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__aei_a25a,,"Lines 1-200+","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding specific code examples for PySpark transformations and validation of suggested PySpark equivalents through testing. The rebuild recommendation is well-justified given the complexity assessment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","These outputs appear to serve different purposes and may not be intended for direct comparison. Future comparisons should ensure outputs address similar domains or objectives for meaningful evaluation."
