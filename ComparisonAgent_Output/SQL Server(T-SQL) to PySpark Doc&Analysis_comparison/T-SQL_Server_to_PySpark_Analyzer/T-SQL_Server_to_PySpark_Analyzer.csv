Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Analysis of T-SQL to PySpark conversion documentation. Only one substantive agent output was provided (uspAPIPatchAccount analysis), making direct comparison impossible. The available output demonstrates comprehensive technical analysis with detailed complexity metrics, syntax differences, and conversion recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one substantive agent output provided. The available analysis covers T-SQL stored procedure conversion to PySpark with comprehensive technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - only one substantive agent output provided. The available document follows a structured format with clear sections for overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization techniques."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpbvjwdpxj,85,Lines 1-250,"The T-SQL to PySpark analysis demonstrates strong technical accuracy with detailed complexity metrics (250 lines, 5 tables, 5 joins), comprehensive syntax difference identification (15+ differences), and appropriate conversion complexity score (65/100). Minor deductions for some generalized recommendations that could be more specific."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpfnhsxzgn,0,N/A,"No substantive content available for analysis - appears to be empty or placeholder file."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,43,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (85 + 0) / 2 = 42.5, rounded to 43."

Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpbvjwdpxj,,"The T-SQL to PySpark analysis is comprehensive and technically sound. Recommendations: 1) Add more specific code examples for complex transformations, 2) Include performance benchmarking data, 3) Provide more detailed error handling patterns for PySpark."
Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpfnhsxzgn,,"No content available for evaluation. Recommend providing substantive analysis output for meaningful comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Future comparisons require two substantive agent outputs. Consider implementing validation to ensure both agents produce meaningful content before comparison analysis."
