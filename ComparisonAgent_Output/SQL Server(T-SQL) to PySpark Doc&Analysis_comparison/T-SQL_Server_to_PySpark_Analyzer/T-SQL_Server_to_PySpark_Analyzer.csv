Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Analysis of T-SQL to PySpark conversion documentation. Only one substantial agent output available (tmpbvjwdpxj) containing comprehensive analysis of uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure conversion. Other agent outputs appear to be empty or placeholder files."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot perform semantic similarity comparison as only one agent (tmpbvjwdpxj) provided substantial output. The other agent outputs appear to be empty temporary files with no content for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot perform structural similarity comparison as only one agent (tmpbvjwdpxj) provided substantial output with clear document structure including sections for Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, and Optimization Techniques."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tmpbvjwdpxj,85,"Lines 1-250","The T-SQL to PySpark analysis is well-structured and technically accurate. Contains comprehensive coverage of conversion complexity (65/100), detailed syntax differences (15+ identified), proper complexity metrics, and appropriate optimization recommendations. Minor deductions for some generalized statements without specific code examples."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Other_tmp_files,0,N/A,"No substantial content available for correctness evaluation. Files appear to be empty or contain only placeholder paths."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,42,,"Average of available scores: (85 + 0) / 2 = 42.5, rounded to 42"

Recommendations,Recommendation,tmpbvjwdpxj,,"Lines 1-250","The T-SQL to PySpark analysis demonstrates strong technical competency with detailed conversion guidance, complexity assessment, and optimization recommendations. Recommend enhancing with specific code examples and more detailed error handling strategies."
