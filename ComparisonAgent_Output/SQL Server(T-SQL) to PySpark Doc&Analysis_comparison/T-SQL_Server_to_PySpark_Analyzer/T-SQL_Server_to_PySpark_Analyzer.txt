# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform complete comparison - only one agent output clearly identified in input. The provided input contains a T-SQL stored procedure analysis document but lacks a second distinct agent output for comparison.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without two distinct agent outputs to compare.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without two distinct agent outputs to compare.

### Correctness

**tmpbvjwdpxj (Score: 85/100)**
- Lines 1-250: T-SQL analysis document shows good structure with clear sections, proper formatting, and comprehensive coverage of stored procedure analysis including complexity metrics, syntax differences, and conversion recommendations.

**tmpfnhsxzgn (Score: 0/100)**
- Second agent output not clearly identifiable in provided input.

**Overall Correctness: 42/100** (Average of available scores)

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | tmpbvjwdpxj | tmpfnhsxzgn | Overall |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 85 | 0 | 42 |
| **Overall** | **28** | **0** | **14** |

## Recommendations

**Primary Issue:** Provide two distinct agent outputs for meaningful comparison. Current input contains only one analyzable document.

**Next Steps:**
1. Ensure both agent outputs are clearly provided and identifiable
2. Verify that both outputs address the same task or instruction
3. Re-run comparison once both outputs are available
