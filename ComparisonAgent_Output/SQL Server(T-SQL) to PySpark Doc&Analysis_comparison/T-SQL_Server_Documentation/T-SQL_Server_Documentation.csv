Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. Agent outputs were not provided in the input - only placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found. Actual content is required to conduct semantic, structural, and correctness analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholders provided instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholders provided instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores."
