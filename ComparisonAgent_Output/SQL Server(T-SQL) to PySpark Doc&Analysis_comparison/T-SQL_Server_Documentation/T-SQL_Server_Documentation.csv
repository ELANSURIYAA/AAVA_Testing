Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both Documentation_Agent and T-SQL_Server_Documentation outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. Documentation_Agent delivers a more structured approach with detailed subsections and extensive tabular data, while T-SQL_Server_Documentation provides a more streamlined narrative flow. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the procedure's purpose, business context, and technical implementation. The semantic alignment is very high with both agents correctly identifying the procedure's role in API data synchronization and PATCH operations. Structural differences exist in organization and presentation style, but both follow logical documentation patterns. Both outputs are syntactically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic understanding of the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. They correctly identify: 1) The procedure's purpose for API PATCH operations and data synchronization, 2) The business problem of maintaining data consistency between AF Group's internal systems and external APIs, 3) The JSON PATCH format output structure, 4) The batch processing mechanism via @LoopInstance parameter, 5) The complex data transformations and field mappings. Minor semantic differences include Documentation_Agent's emphasis on 'enterprise-grade validation solutions' context while T-SQL_Server_Documentation focuses more on direct procedural analysis. Both correctly interpret the procedure's role in insurance industry data integration workflows."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-20, 50-100, 150-200","Both outputs follow similar high-level documentation structures with numbered sections covering Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Complexity Analysis, and Error Handling. However, significant structural differences exist: Documentation_Agent uses more granular subsections (1.1, 1.2, etc.) and extensive tabular presentations for data mapping and complexity metrics. T-SQL_Server_Documentation employs a more linear narrative structure with fewer subsections. Documentation_Agent includes 60+ detailed field mappings in tabular format, while T-SQL_Server_Documentation presents similar information in a more condensed table. Both use appropriate technical documentation patterns but with different organizational philosophies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_Agent,95,"Lines 10, 25, 100, 200","Documentation_Agent output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured tables. All section numbers are sequential, table headers are consistent, and technical terminology is used accurately. Minor issues include some repetitive phrasing in business context sections and occasional verbose explanations that could be more concise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_Documentation,94,"Lines 15, 75, 150, 225","T-SQL_Server_Documentation output is syntactically correct with proper formatting and consistent structure. Technical details are accurate and well-presented. The documentation maintains internal consistency throughout. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in the complexity analysis table and a few instances where technical details could be more precise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper documentation formatting, accurate technical content, and consistent internal structure. Average score reflects strong syntactic correctness across both agents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_Agent,,"Consider streamlining verbose business context sections and reducing repetitive explanations. The extensive tabular format is excellent for reference but could benefit from executive summary tables for key metrics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,T-SQL_Server_Documentation,,"Consider adding more granular subsections for complex topics and expanding the data mapping table to include all field transformations. The linear narrative style is effective but could benefit from more structured presentation of technical details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology, 2) More detailed error handling analysis with specific recommendations, 3) Performance considerations section, 4) Version control and change management guidance, 5) Cross-references between related procedures or systems."
