Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both documentation outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. Documentation_1 presents a more structured academic approach with detailed tables and metrics, while Documentation_2 offers a more practical business-focused perspective. Both cover the same core functionality but with different emphasis and presentation styles."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs correctly identify the stored procedure's purpose as preparing account data for API PATCH operations. They share the same understanding of business problems (data synchronization between AF Group's internal systems and external APIs) and core functionality. Minor differences exist in emphasis: Documentation_1 focuses more on technical integration aspects while Documentation_2 emphasizes business workflow context. Both correctly identify the JSON PATCH format output and batch processing capabilities."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,,"Both documents follow nearly identical structural organization with 7 main sections: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. The logical flow and section decomposition are highly aligned. Minor structural differences include Documentation_1's use of more detailed tables and metrics formatting, while Documentation_2 uses more narrative explanations within sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_1,95,"Lines 45-50, 180-185","Highly accurate technical documentation with precise SQL component identification. Minor issues: Line 45 shows 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' which appears to be a formatting artifact. Line 180-185 complexity metrics are well-structured but some values like 'Overall Complexity Score: 75/100' could benefit from more detailed calculation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Documentation_2,93,"Lines 60-65, 220-225","Accurate and well-formatted documentation with clear technical details. Minor issues: Line 60-65 shows some inconsistent formatting in the structure description. Line 220-225 complexity score of '60/100' differs from Documentation_1 without clear justification for the variance."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive coverage of the stored procedure functionality. Minor formatting inconsistencies and slight variations in complexity scoring prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_1,,"Excellent comprehensive documentation with strong technical detail. Recommend: 1) Fix formatting artifact 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' on line 45, 2) Provide more detailed methodology for complexity scoring calculations, 3) Consider adding more business context examples to balance technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Documentation_2,,"Strong business-focused documentation with clear practical insights. Recommend: 1) Improve formatting consistency in structure descriptions (lines 60-65), 2) Align complexity scoring methodology with industry standards, 3) Add more detailed technical metrics to complement business perspective, 4) Provide justification for complexity score differences."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable perspectives on the same stored procedure. Consider combining Documentation_1's technical rigor with Documentation_2's business clarity for optimal documentation. Both should standardize complexity scoring methodology and resolve minor formatting inconsistencies for production use."
