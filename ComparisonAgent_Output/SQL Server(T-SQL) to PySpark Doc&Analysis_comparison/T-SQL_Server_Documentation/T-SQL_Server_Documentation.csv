Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. Agent 1 delivers a structured 7-section analysis with detailed complexity metrics and business context. Agent 2 provides similar coverage but with different organizational approach and more granular field descriptions. Key differences include structural organization, depth of technical analysis, and presentation style. Both documents accurately describe the procedure's purpose, data transformations, and API integration functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-366,"Both documents address the same core purpose: documenting the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure for API PATCH operations. They cover identical business problems (data synchronization between AF Group's systems and external APIs), similar technical concepts (JSON PATCH format, batch processing, account data transformation), and equivalent functional descriptions. Minor differences exist in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses more on business context and integration workflow while Agent 2 provides more granular field-level details. The semantic intent and meaning are highly aligned across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,1-366,"Significant structural differences exist between the outputs. Agent 1 uses a numbered 7-section format (Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling) with consistent subsection organization. Agent 2 uses a different structure with dashed separators and includes additional sections like 'Field List and Descriptions' at the end. Both follow logical documentation flow but with different decomposition approaches. Agent 1 includes formal complexity metrics tables while Agent 2 provides more narrative descriptions. The overall information architecture differs substantially despite covering similar content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,1-366,"Agent 1 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, well-formed tables, accurate cross-references, and professional documentation standards. All sections are properly numbered and organized. Tables use correct markdown syntax. No broken references or formatting errors detected. Minor deduction for some repetitive phrasing in business context sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,1-366,"Agent 2 output shows strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent use of separators, well-structured tables, and clear section organization. All field descriptions are properly formatted and internally consistent. Some minor formatting inconsistencies in separator usage and table alignment. The field list section maintains consistent structure throughout. No major syntactic errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper documentation formatting, consistent internal structure, and professional presentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,1-50,"Maintain the excellent structured approach with numbered sections and formal complexity metrics. Consider adding more granular field descriptions similar to Agent 2's approach. The business context and integration workflow descriptions are valuable and should be preserved."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,1-50,"Adopt more consistent structural organization similar to Agent 1's numbered sections. The detailed field descriptions and comprehensive mapping tables are excellent and should be maintained. Consider adding formal complexity metrics and scoring systems for enhanced technical analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized documentation templates for consistency, 2) Integration of Agent 1's structured approach with Agent 2's detailed field descriptions, 3) Addition of code examples or sample outputs, 4) Cross-referencing between sections for better navigation, 5) Version control and change tracking capabilities for documentation maintenance."
