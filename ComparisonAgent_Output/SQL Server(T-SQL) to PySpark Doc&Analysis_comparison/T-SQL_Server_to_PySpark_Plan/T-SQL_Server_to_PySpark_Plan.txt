# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide cost and effort estimates for SQL Server to PySpark migration but with vastly different approaches. Agent 1 delivers comprehensive enterprise-grade analysis with detailed breakdowns, while Agent 2 provides simplified estimates with basic calculations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating PySpark migration costs and effort. However, they diverge significantly in scope and depth. Agent 1 provides detailed daily/monthly/annual cost projections with specific DBU calculations, storage costs, and network costs, while Agent 2 offers simplified per-run estimates. The effort estimates also differ dramatically (216-280 hours vs 30 hours), suggesting different interpretations of project complexity.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 1: $4,985.90 annual cost vs Agent 2: $1.20-$6.00 per run
- Agent 1: 216-280 hours effort vs Agent 2: 30 hours effort
- Agent 1: Comprehensive breakdown vs Agent 2: High-level estimates

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with cost estimation followed by effort estimation sections. Agent 1 uses hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) and detailed subsections, while Agent 2 uses simpler formatting with bullet points and summary tables. Both include API cost reporting as required.

**Structural Elements:**
- Both: Cost estimation → Effort estimation → API costs
- Agent 1: Detailed hierarchical structure with subsections
- Agent 2: Simplified bullet points with summary table

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**
Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost calculations presentation (lines 8-15, 20-25), but all mathematical computations are accurate and properly structured. JSON structure is valid and calculations are internally consistent.

**Agent 2 (Score: 90/100)**
Some inconsistencies in DBU calculations (lines 15-20, 35-40) - mentions 1 DBU/hr but calculates with different assumptions. Table formatting is proper but some calculation assumptions could be clearer.

**Overall Correctness: 93/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 65 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Correctness | 95 | 90 | 93 |
| **Overall** | **78** | **78** | **78** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:** Provides enterprise-grade analysis suitable for executive decision-making with comprehensive cost modeling and detailed implementation planning.

**For Agent 2:** Offers practical quick estimates suitable for initial project scoping but lacks depth for detailed planning and budgeting.

**Combined Approach:** Consider combining approaches: use Agent 1's comprehensive methodology with Agent 2's concise presentation format for optimal stakeholder communication.
