# Agent Comparison Report: SQL Server to PySpark Migration Analysis

## Executive Summary

Two distinct approaches to SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation were analyzed. **Agent 1** provides a comprehensive enterprise-level analysis with detailed cost breakdowns and extensive effort estimates (216-280 hours), while **Agent 2** offers conservative estimates with simplified calculations (30 hours total). There is significant variance in both cost projections and implementation effort estimates, representing different scales and complexity assumptions for the migration project.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation with similar core objectives. Agent 1 focuses on enterprise-scale implementation with detailed operational costs including daily ($13.66), monthly ($409.80), and annual ($4,985.90) runtime projections. Agent 2 provides conservative estimates for smaller-scale deployment with $1.20-$6.00 per run costs. Both cover runtime costs and implementation effort but operate at vastly different scales and assumptions, leading to a moderate semantic alignment score.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 1: Enterprise-scale with comprehensive cost modeling
- Agent 2: Conservative approach with simplified resource calculations
- Both address the same migration challenge but target different implementation scales

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow similar structural organization with Cost Estimation sections followed by Code Fixing/Testing Effort sections. Agent 1 uses hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) and includes optimization opportunities, while Agent 2 uses a simpler structure with a summary table. Both conclude with API costs and assumptions, demonstrating strong structural alignment despite different presentation styles.

**Structural Elements:**
- Both: Cost Estimation → Implementation Effort → API Costs
- Agent 1: Hierarchical numbering with optimization sections
- Agent 2: Simplified structure with summary table format

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100):**
Mathematically sound calculations with proper cost breakdowns. All numerical calculations verify correctly:
- Daily $13.66 × 30 = $409.80 ✓
- Monthly $409.80 × 12 = $4,985.90 ✓
- Effort estimates well-structured across development (120-160 hours) and testing (96-120 hours) phases

Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in bullet points (lines 15-25).

**Agent 2 (Score: 90/100):**
Conservative but mathematically correct estimates. DBU calculations properly structured:
- 4 nodes × 2 hours × 1 DBU = 8 DBU ✓
- Cost range: $0.15-$0.75 × 8 DBU = $1.20-$6.00 ✓

Minor deduction for summary table formatting that could be improved for better readability (lines 25-35).

**Overall Correctness: 93/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 90 | 93 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **82** | **84** |

## Recommendations

### For Agent 1
**Strengths:** Excellent comprehensive analysis suitable for enterprise-level planning with detailed cost breakdowns and thorough effort estimation.

**Improvements:** 
- Consider adding conservative scenario estimates for comparison
- Strengthen assumptions documentation 
- Add risk mitigation strategies for the identified challenges

### For Agent 2
**Strengths:** Good conservative approach ideal for initial planning phases with clear, simplified calculations.

**Improvements:**
- Consider expanding cost analysis to include multiple scenarios (low/medium/high complexity)
- Add more detailed breakdown of testing phases
- Include potential optimization strategies similar to Agent 1's approach
