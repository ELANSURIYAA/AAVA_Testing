Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-30 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for SQL Server to PySpark migration. Agent 1 offers more detailed breakdown with specific daily/monthly/annual costs ($13.66 daily, $409.80 monthly, $4,985.90 annual) while Agent 2 provides range-based estimates ($1.20-$6.00 per run). Both address runtime costs, development effort, and testing requirements with different levels of granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 35-45","Both outputs fundamentally address the same goal: estimating costs and effort for SQL Server to PySpark migration. Agent 1 provides detailed daily/monthly/annual runtime costs with specific DBU calculations, while Agent 2 offers per-run cost ranges. Both identify similar technical challenges (JSON construction, CTEs, window functions) and testing requirements. Minor divergence in cost calculation methodology but aligned in overall purpose and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-5 (headers), Lines 20-30 (cost sections), Lines 40-60 (effort sections)","Agent 1 uses hierarchical numbered sections (1.1, 2.1) with detailed subsections for compute/storage/network costs. Agent 2 employs a flatter structure with bullet points and a summary table format. Both follow logical flow: cost estimation → effort estimation → summary, but Agent 1 provides more granular breakdown while Agent 2 uses more concise tabular presentation. Different organizational approaches but similar logical progression."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Plan_Agent1,95,"Lines 8-12 (cost calculations), Lines 25-30 (effort estimates)","Agent 1 demonstrates strong internal consistency with detailed cost calculations (DBU rates, storage costs, network costs) that aggregate correctly. Mathematical calculations are accurate: $2.42 × 5 hours = $12.10, $13.66 × 30 = $409.80. Effort estimates (96-120 hours total) align with detailed breakdowns. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points but overall syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Plan_Agent2,92,"Lines 15-20 (cost ranges), Lines 35-40 (effort breakdown), Lines 50-55 (summary table)","Agent 2 maintains good internal consistency with cost range calculations (8 DBU × $0.15-$0.75 = $1.20-$6.00). Effort estimates sum correctly (12+8+6+4 = 30 hours). Summary table accurately reflects the detailed estimates. Some minor formatting variations in bullet points and occasional inconsistent spacing, but mathematically and structurally sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"Combined analysis of both outputs","Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate calculations and internal consistency. Agent 1 shows slightly better formatting consistency while Agent 2 has minor spacing issues. Mathematical accuracy is strong in both cases with proper aggregation of costs and effort estimates."

Recommendations,Recommendation,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Plan_Agent1,,"Lines 1-50","Maintain the detailed cost breakdown approach but consider adding range-based estimates for uncertainty. The hierarchical structure is excellent for comprehensive documentation. Consider adding a summary table similar to Agent 2 for quick reference."
Recommendations,Recommendation,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Plan_Agent2,,"Lines 1-60","The concise format and summary table are excellent for executive consumption. Consider expanding the cost analysis to include monthly/annual projections as shown in Agent 1. The range-based approach effectively communicates uncertainty."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting consistency, 2) Hybrid approach combining Agent 1's detail with Agent 2's conciseness, 3) Clear assumptions documentation, 4) Risk factor analysis for cost variations, 5) Timeline dependencies for effort estimates."
