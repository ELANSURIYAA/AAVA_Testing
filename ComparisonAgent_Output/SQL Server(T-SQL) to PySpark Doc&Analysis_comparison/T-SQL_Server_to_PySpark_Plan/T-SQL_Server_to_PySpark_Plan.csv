Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - agent outputs not provided. Input contains placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - no agent output provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Plan_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - no agent output provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent evaluations."
