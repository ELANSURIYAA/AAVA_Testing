Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide cost and effort estimates for SQL Server to PySpark migration but with vastly different approaches. Agent 1 delivers comprehensive enterprise-grade analysis with detailed breakdowns, while Agent 2 provides simplified estimates with basic calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Agent 1: Lines 1-120, Agent 2: Lines 1-45","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating PySpark migration costs and effort. However, they diverge significantly in scope and depth. Agent 1 provides detailed daily/monthly/annual cost projections with specific DBU calculations, storage costs, and network costs, while Agent 2 offers simplified per-run estimates. The effort estimates also differ dramatically (216-280 hours vs 30 hours), suggesting different interpretations of project complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Agent 1: Lines 1-120, Agent 2: Lines 1-45","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with cost estimation followed by effort estimation sections. Agent 1 uses hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) and detailed subsections, while Agent 2 uses simpler formatting with bullet points and summary tables. Both include API cost reporting as required."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 8-15, 20-25","Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost calculations presentation, but all mathematical computations are accurate and properly structured. JSON structure is valid and calculations are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,90,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Some inconsistencies in DBU calculations (mentions 1 DBU/hr but calculates with different assumptions). Table formatting is proper but some calculation assumptions could be clearer."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,"","Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor presentation issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,"","Agent 1 provides enterprise-grade analysis suitable for executive decision-making with comprehensive cost modeling and detailed implementation planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,"","Agent 2 offers practical quick estimates suitable for initial project scoping but lacks depth for detailed planning and budgeting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"","Consider combining approaches: use Agent 1's comprehensive methodology with Agent 2's concise presentation format for optimal stakeholder communication."
