Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Analysis Status: INCOMPLETE - Template variables detected in input data. The provided input contains unresolved placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual agent outputs. Without concrete content to analyze, meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions cannot be performed. This indicates a preprocessing failure in the data pipeline."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Semantic similarity evaluation requires actual content from both agents to assess meaning, intent, and purpose alignment. Current input contains only template placeholders, making semantic analysis impossible. Score defaulted to 0 due to absence of evaluable content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Structural similarity assessment requires examination of logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns. Template variables prevent analysis of actual structure, control flow, or component hierarchy. Score defaulted to 0 due to unavailable structural elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Syntax-level correctness evaluation impossible without Agent 1 output content. Template variable {{agent 1_string_true}} provides no syntactic elements to validate. Cannot assess code syntax, schema validity, or internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Syntax-level correctness evaluation impossible without Agent 2 output content. Template variable {{agent 2_string_true}} provides no syntactic elements to validate. Cannot assess code syntax, schema validity, or internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score computed as average of individual agent scores. Since both agents scored 0 due to missing content, overall score is 0. Meaningful correctness evaluation requires actual syntactic content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Critical Issue Resolution Required: 1. Verify template variable resolution in preprocessing pipeline - ensure {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} are replaced with actual agent outputs before analysis. 2. Implement input validation to detect unresolved templates and fail fast with descriptive error messages. 3. Review data flow architecture to prevent template leakage to analysis components. 4. Once actual content is provided, re-run analysis with proper semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation protocols."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Process Improvement: Establish content validation checkpoints to ensure analysis receives properly formatted, non-template data. Implement automated testing for template resolution to prevent similar issues in production workflows."
