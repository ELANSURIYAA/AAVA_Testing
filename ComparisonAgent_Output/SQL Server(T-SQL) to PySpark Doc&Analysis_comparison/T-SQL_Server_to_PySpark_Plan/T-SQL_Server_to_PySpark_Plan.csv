Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-45 (Agent 2)","Two distinct approaches to SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation. Agent 1 provides comprehensive enterprise-level analysis with detailed cost breakdowns and extensive effort estimates (216-280 hours). Agent 2 offers conservative estimates with simplified calculations (30 hours total). Significant variance in both cost projections and implementation effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-10 (both agents)","Both outputs address SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation with similar core objectives. Agent 1 focuses on enterprise-scale implementation with detailed operational costs, while Agent 2 provides conservative estimates for smaller-scale deployment. Both cover runtime costs and implementation effort but with vastly different scales and assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-45 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar structural organization: Cost Estimation section followed by Code Fixing/Testing Effort section. Agent 1 uses hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) and includes optimization opportunities, while Agent 2 uses simpler structure with summary table. Both conclude with API costs and assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 15-25, Lines 35-45","Mathematically sound calculations with proper cost breakdowns. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points. All numerical calculations verify correctly (daily $13.66 × 30 = $409.80, monthly × 12 = $4,985.90). Effort estimates well-structured across development and testing phases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,90,"Lines 10-20, Lines 25-35","Conservative but mathematically correct estimates. DBU calculations properly structured (4 nodes × 2 hours × 1 DBU = 8 DBU). Cost range calculations accurate ($0.15-$0.75 × 8 DBU). Summary table formatting could be improved for better readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper numerical calculations and logical flow. Agent 1 shows more comprehensive analysis depth while Agent 2 provides clearer conservative estimates."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 40-50","Excellent comprehensive analysis suitable for enterprise-level planning. Consider adding conservative scenario estimates for comparison. Strengthen assumptions documentation and add risk mitigation strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 35-45","Good conservative approach ideal for initial planning phases. Consider expanding cost analysis to include multiple scenarios (low/medium/high complexity). Add more detailed breakdown of testing phases and potential optimization strategies."
