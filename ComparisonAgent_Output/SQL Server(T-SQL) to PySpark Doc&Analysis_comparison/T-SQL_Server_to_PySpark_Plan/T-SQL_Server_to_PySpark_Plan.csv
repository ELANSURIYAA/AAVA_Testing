Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All lines,"Two comprehensive cost and effort estimation reports for SQL Server to PySpark migration. First output provides detailed multi-timeframe cost analysis ($4,985.90 annual vs $1.20-$6.00 per run in second output) with extensive 216-280 hour effort estimates. Second output offers more concise analysis with 30-hour effort estimate and structured summary table. Both address same core requirements but differ significantly in scope, detail level, and cost modeling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All lines,"Both outputs address SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation with shared core intent. First output focuses on comprehensive operational cost modeling (daily/monthly/annual) while second output emphasizes per-run cost analysis. Both cover runtime costs and development effort but with different granularity levels. First output includes optimization opportunities and API costs ($2,500-$5,000/month vs $0.002500), while second provides structured summary table. Semantic alignment is strong on core purpose but diverges on scope and cost modeling approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,Lines 1-50 vs 1-30,"First output uses detailed hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1) with extensive subsections, bullet points, and multi-level breakdowns. Second output employs simpler numbered structure (1, 2, 3) with summary table conclusion. Both follow logical flow: Cost estimation → Effort estimation → Summary, but organize information differently. First output has more complex nested structure while second uses flatter organization with tabular summary."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,98,Lines 15-20,"Highly structured document with consistent formatting, proper numbering, valid calculations, and coherent internal references. Minor formatting inconsistency in cost breakdown presentation but overall excellent syntax and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,95,Lines 25-30,"Well-formatted document with consistent structure, valid calculations, and proper table formatting. Some minor inconsistencies in bullet point formatting and spacing, but overall strong syntactic correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal structure, and valid numerical calculations. Average score reflects high quality documentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed cost modeling and extensive effort estimation. Consider adding per-run cost analysis for operational flexibility. Strong documentation standards maintained throughout."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Concise and well-structured analysis with practical summary table. Consider expanding cost analysis to include longer-term operational projections. Good balance of detail and accessibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both outputs provide valuable perspectives on migration planning. First output better for comprehensive planning and budgeting, second output better for quick operational estimates. Consider combining detailed cost modeling approach from first output with summary table format from second output for optimal stakeholder communication."
