Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for SQL Server to PySpark migration. Agent 1 delivers a more detailed analysis with specific runtime costs ($13.66 daily, $4,985.90 annual) and extensive effort breakdown (216-280 hours). Agent 2 provides a more concise estimation with lower runtime costs ($1.20-$6.00 per run) and significantly lower effort estimate (30 hours). Both outputs are well-structured documentation addressing the same migration planning objective."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs address SQL Server to PySpark migration cost estimation with similar intent. Agent 1 focuses on comprehensive daily/monthly/annual runtime costs with detailed breakdown, while Agent 2 emphasizes per-run costs with conservative estimates. Both cover development effort and testing, but with significantly different scope and time estimates. The core semantic intent aligns but execution approaches differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30, 60-90","Both outputs follow similar structural patterns: Cost Estimation section followed by Effort Estimation section. Agent 1 uses numbered hierarchical structure (1.1, 2.1) with detailed subsections, while Agent 2 uses similar numbering but with more concise organization. Both include summary tables and API cost sections. Structure is highly aligned despite different levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 40-45, 100-105","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent numbering, and well-formed calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section where 'apiCost: 0.00 USD' appears at the end without proper integration into the document structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-150","Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with consistent markdown formatting, proper table structure, clear section organization, and well-integrated API cost reporting. All calculations and formatting are properly structured and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting. Agent 2 shows slightly better formatting consistency, while Agent 1 has minor structural issues in the API cost section. Overall correctness is very high for both agents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 80-120","Agent 1 provides comprehensive detail but may benefit from clearer cost range presentation and better integration of the API cost section into the main document structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 1-50","Agent 2 offers excellent conciseness and formatting but could benefit from more detailed breakdown of effort estimation components and consideration of various complexity scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both agents would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost presentation format, 2) Clearer assumptions documentation, 3) Risk factor consideration in estimates, 4) Validation methodology for effort estimates. Consider combining Agent 1's comprehensive detail with Agent 2's clear formatting approach."
