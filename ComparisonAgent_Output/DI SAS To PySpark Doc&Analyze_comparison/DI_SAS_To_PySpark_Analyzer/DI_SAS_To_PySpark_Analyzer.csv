Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs analyze the TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for TAMBr process migration to PySpark. Agent 1 provides a concise technical analysis with structured metrics (431 lines, 18 tables, complexity score 82/100) and focuses on migration challenges. Agent 2 offers more comprehensive business context (490 lines, 22 tables, same complexity score 82/100) with detailed workflow descriptions and enhanced optimization strategies. Both recommend rebuild approach due to heavy macro usage and SAS-specific functions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. They share identical business understanding (TAMBr process, ring calculations, customer-main relationships) and reach the same conclusion (rebuild recommendation, complexity score 82/100). Minor differences exist in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on technical metrics while Agent 2 provides richer business context and workflow details. The semantic alignment is strong with consistent terminology and migration strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,1-50,"Both outputs follow similar high-level organization: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics table, Syntax Compatibility, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. However, Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like detailed business problem description and enhanced workflow sections. Agent 1 uses more concise bullet-point formatting while Agent 2 employs more narrative descriptions. The metrics tables have slight differences in line counts (431 vs 490) and table counts (18 vs 22) but maintain consistent structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,1-50,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent table structure, and accurate technical references. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in the complexity metrics table and occasional unclear line references. All technical content appears accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,97,1-50,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and accurate technical details. The complexity metrics table is well-formatted and comprehensive. All internal references are consistent and technical content is accurate with enhanced detail and clarity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs maintain high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and accurate technical content. Agent 2 slightly edges out with better consistency and enhanced detail presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,1-20,"Agent 1 provides solid technical analysis but could benefit from enhanced business context and more detailed workflow descriptions to match the comprehensiveness of Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,1-30,"Agent 2 delivers excellent comprehensive analysis with strong business context. Minor improvements could include more structured formatting in some sections to enhance readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs successfully identify the same migration challenges and provide consistent rebuild recommendations. Consider combining Agent 1's concise technical metrics with Agent 2's comprehensive business context for optimal documentation. Both correctly identify macro logic, geospatial functions, and PROC UNIVARIATE as key migration challenges requiring PySpark alternatives."
