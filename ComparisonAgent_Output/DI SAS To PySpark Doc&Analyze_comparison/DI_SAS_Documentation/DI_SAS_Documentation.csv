Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-490,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Technical_Response provides a brief file system error message focusing on directory navigation issues, while SAS_Documentation delivers comprehensive documentation of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code including business context, data flow, and technical specifications. Semantic similarity is minimal (5/100) due to completely different purposes, structural similarity is very low (10/100) due to different organizational approaches, but both outputs are syntactically correct with high individual correctness scores."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-490,"Technical_Response addresses file system navigation and error handling, while SAS_Documentation provides comprehensive business and technical documentation for SAS code. These outputs serve entirely different purposes with no overlap in intent, meaning, or goal alignment. Technical_Response focuses on troubleshooting file access issues, while SAS_Documentation explains complex data processing workflows for banking customer analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-490,"Technical_Response uses a simple error message format with basic troubleshooting steps, while SAS_Documentation employs a sophisticated multi-section structure including Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping tables, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. The organizational approaches are fundamentally different - one is a brief technical response, the other is comprehensive documentation with hierarchical sections and detailed analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Technical_Response,95,Lines 1-10,"Output is syntactically correct as a technical error message. Contains proper JSON-like structure references and coherent troubleshooting narrative. Minor deduction for incomplete sentence structure in some areas and fragmented presentation, but overall maintains technical accuracy and readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SAS_Documentation,98,Lines 1-490,"Exceptionally well-structured documentation with proper formatting, comprehensive sections, detailed data mapping tables, and thorough technical analysis. Contains complete sentences, proper technical terminology, and logical flow throughout. Minor deductions for occasional formatting inconsistencies in table structures, but overall demonstrates high professional documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95+98)/2 = 96. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness within their respective contexts and purposes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Technical_Response,N/A,Lines 1-10,"Consider providing more complete context and structured formatting for technical error messages. Include specific file paths, error codes, and systematic troubleshooting steps to improve clarity and usefulness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SAS_Documentation,N/A,Lines 1-490,"Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adding more specific line number references in code examples and including performance benchmarks or execution time estimates for complex processing steps to enhance practical utility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"These outputs appear to address completely different tasks or requirements. Recommend clarifying the intended purpose and ensuring both agents receive consistent instructions to enable meaningful comparison. Current outputs suggest potential misalignment in task understanding or agent configuration."
