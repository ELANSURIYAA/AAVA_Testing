Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-490","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for PySpark migration of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code to Azure Databricks. Agent 1 provides more detailed breakdown with specific DBU calculations and comprehensive task estimation (35 hours total). Agent 2 offers broader cost range with more conservative estimates and slightly higher effort estimate (36 hours). Both address runtime costs, manual code fixes, and testing requirements with similar technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 80-120, 200-250","Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation and manual effort estimation for SAS-to-PySpark migration. Agent 1 focuses on precise DBU calculations ($1.62 total cost) while Agent 2 provides cost ranges ($2.40-$12.00). Both identify same technical challenges: macro conversion, geospatial functions, percentile calculations, and testing requirements. Minor divergence in cost methodology but same underlying understanding of migration complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-30, 60-90, 150-200","Both follow nearly identical structure: 1.1 Cost Estimation with runtime breakdown, followed by 2.1 Code Fixing and Testing Effort. Both use hierarchical numbering, bullet points for technical details, and tabular effort breakdowns. Agent 1 uses more detailed sub-sections (1.1.1) while Agent 2 has flatter structure. Both conclude with similar effort estimation tables and technical requirement lists."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Comprehensive,95,"Lines 40-60, 200-250","Well-formed document structure with consistent formatting. All technical references are properly cited. DBU calculations are mathematically sound (3 nodes × 2 hours × $0.27 = $1.62). Effort estimation table is properly formatted with clear task breakdown totaling 35 hours. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point indentation around lines 45-50."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Standard,93,"Lines 30-70, 180-220","Generally well-structured with proper formatting. Cost calculation methodology is sound with appropriate ranges. Some redundancy in manual adjustments section (lines 180-220) where content is repeated. Effort breakdown is clear and totals correctly to 36 hours. Minor inconsistency in DBU rate presentation ($0.15-$0.75 range vs single point estimate)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong technical accuracy and formatting with minor presentation issues in both documents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Comprehensive,,"Lines 200-250","Standardize bullet point formatting for consistency. Consider adding cost sensitivity analysis to complement precise DBU calculations. Expand on cluster sizing rationale for the Standard_DS3_v2 selection."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Standard,,"Lines 180-220","Remove redundant content in manual adjustments section. Provide more specific DBU rate justification rather than broad ranges. Consider adding precision to effort hour estimates with confidence intervals."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency. Consider creating a hybrid approach combining Agent 1's precision with Agent 2's risk-aware cost ranges. Standardize effort estimation methodology and add validation checkpoints for cost assumptions."
