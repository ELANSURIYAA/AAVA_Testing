Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two data migration mapping outputs with identical structural approach but completely different entity focus. First output covers Agreement entity with complex multi-table mappings, second covers _ClickAgreement with direct field mappings. High structural similarity (95) due to identical table format and methodology, but low semantic similarity (25) due to different entities and mapping complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-30","Outputs address fundamentally different entities: 'Agreement' vs '_ClickAgreement'. First output shows complex multi-table mappings (svc_Agreements_agreement, svc_Agreements_AgreementDataCda) with field transformations like 'notes' to 'otherComments' and reference fields with '.v12Migration_ssid' suffixes. Second output shows simple 1:1 direct mappings with identical field names. Different migration complexity levels and entity scopes result in low semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-30","Both outputs use identical markdown table structure with same 6 columns: Entity_Key, Attr_Name, Table Name, Column Name, MappingScore, ReasonforScore. Same logical decomposition approach, identical scoring methodology (High/Medium), and consistent reasoning format. Only structural difference is table length (33 vs 30 rows)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output1,100,"Lines 1-33","Valid markdown table syntax throughout. Consistent column alignment, proper pipe separators, no syntax errors. All field references are well-formed, table names follow proper naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output2,100,"Lines 1-30","Valid markdown table syntax throughout. Consistent column alignment, proper pipe separators, no syntax errors. All field references are well-formed, entity names follow proper naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no structural or formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output1,,"Consider providing entity context documentation to clarify the relationship between Agreement and _ClickAgreement entities for comprehensive migration planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output2,,"Expand mapping complexity analysis to identify potential data transformation requirements even for direct field mappings."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Standardize entity naming conventions and consider consolidating mapping approaches for related entities to improve migration consistency."
