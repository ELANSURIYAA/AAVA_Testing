Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-31","Two distinct approaches to data migration mapping: Agent 1 provides comprehensive Agreement entity mapping with complex transformations and multiple target tables, while Agent 2 focuses on _ClickAgreement with direct 1:1 mappings. Both outputs are well-structured markdown tables but serve different migration scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-31","Fundamental semantic divergence: Agent 1 maps 'Agreement' entities to 'svc_Agreements_agreement' and 'svc_Agreements_AgreementDataCda' tables with complex field transformations (e.g., 'notes' to 'otherComments', fields with '.v12Migration_ssid' suffixes). Agent 2 maps '_ClickAgreement' entities with identical source-target field names. Different entity types, different complexity levels, different migration strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-31","Both outputs use identical markdown table structure with 6 columns: Entity_Key, Attr_Name, Table Name, Column Name, MappingScore, ReasonforScore. Same header format, same row organization, same scoring methodology (High/Medium confidence levels). Minor difference: Agent 1 has 33 rows vs Agent 2's 31 rows."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 1-33","Near-perfect markdown table syntax. All rows properly formatted with consistent pipe delimiters. Headers align with content. One minor issue: Line 35 contains explanatory text outside table structure which breaks pure table format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,"Lines 1-31","Perfect markdown table syntax. All 31 rows properly formatted with consistent pipe delimiters, proper alignment, and clean structure. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 15, 35","Consider removing explanatory text (line 35) to maintain pure table format. Verify complex field mappings like 'notes' to 'otherComments' (line 15) have proper business logic validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 1-31","Output is syntactically perfect. Consider adding complexity indicators for migration planning, as all High-confidence 1:1 mappings may oversimplify actual migration requirements."
