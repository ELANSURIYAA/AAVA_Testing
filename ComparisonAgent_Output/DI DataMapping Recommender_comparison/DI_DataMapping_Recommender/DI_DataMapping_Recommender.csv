Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-33 (v10_to_v12_Migration) vs Lines 1-30 (_ClickAgreement_Migration),"Two data migration mapping outputs analyzed: v10_to_v12_Migration provides comprehensive Agreement entity mapping with complex field transformations and v12Migration_ssid references, while _ClickAgreement_Migration provides simpler 1:1 entity mappings. Both follow identical structural patterns but address different entity scopes. Semantic similarity: 75/100 (same migration intent, different entities). Structural similarity: 95/100 (nearly identical table format and methodology). Correctness: 100/100 (both syntactically perfect)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-30,"Both outputs serve the same fundamental purpose of data migration mapping from v10 to v12, but target different entities and complexity levels. v10_to_v12_Migration (lines 1-33) addresses Agreement entity with sophisticated field mappings including .v12Migration_ssid transformations, nested object references, and complex business logic. _ClickAgreement_Migration (lines 1-30) provides straightforward 1:1 mappings for _ClickAgreement entity with identical field names between versions. The semantic intent aligns at 75% - both understand migration requirements but apply different transformation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-30,"Exceptional structural alignment with identical 6-column markdown table format: Entity_Key, Attr_Name, Table Name, Column Name, MappingScore, ReasonforScore. Both use consistent High/Medium/Low scoring methodology and follow identical reasoning patterns in ReasonforScore column. Minor structural difference: v10_to_v12_Migration includes a note section (lines 31-33) and reference to external file, while _ClickAgreement_Migration ends directly after table. Flow and decomposition approach are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,v10_to_v12_Migration,100,Lines 1-33,"Perfect markdown table syntax with proper pipe delimiters, consistent column alignment, and well-formed headers. All field references are syntactically valid, no broken internal references, and consistent formatting throughout. Note section properly formatted with asterisk notation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,_ClickAgreement_Migration,100,Lines 1-30,"Perfect markdown table syntax with proper pipe delimiters, consistent column alignment, and well-formed headers. All entity and attribute references follow consistent naming conventions, no syntax errors detected, and uniform formatting maintained throughout all 29 data rows."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate flawless syntactic correctness with perfect markdown table formatting, consistent column structures, and no internal reference errors. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,v10_to_v12_Migration,N/A,Lines 15-16,"Consider standardizing the mapping approach for 'notes' to 'otherComments' transformation (line 15) by providing more detailed transformation rules. The Medium score indicates potential data loss or semantic drift that should be validated."
Recommendations,Recommendation,_ClickAgreement_Migration,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Excellent 1:1 mapping consistency. Consider adding transformation complexity indicators for future migrations where field names might not align as perfectly. Document any business rule validations required during migration."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized confidence scoring criteria definition, 2) Cross-reference validation between different entity mappings, 3) Addition of data type compatibility checks, 4) Migration sequence dependencies documentation."
