# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two data migration mapping outputs with identical structural approach but completely different entity focus. The first output covers Agreement entity with complex multi-table mappings, while the second covers _ClickAgreement with direct field mappings. High structural similarity (95/100) due to identical table format and methodology, but low semantic similarity (25/100) due to different entities and mapping complexity.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 25/100)

The outputs address fundamentally different entities: 'Agreement' vs '_ClickAgreement'. The first output demonstrates complex multi-table mappings involving `svc_Agreements_agreement` and `svc_Agreements_AgreementDataCda` tables with field transformations like 'notes' to 'otherComments' and reference fields with '.v12Migration_ssid' suffixes. The second output shows simple 1:1 direct mappings with identical field names between v10 and v12 versions. The different migration complexity levels and entity scopes result in low semantic alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs use identical markdown table structure with the same 6 columns: Entity_Key, Attr_Name, Table Name, Column Name, MappingScore, and ReasonforScore. They follow the same logical decomposition approach, identical scoring methodology (High/Medium), and consistent reasoning format. The only structural difference is table length (33 vs 30 rows).

### Correctness

**DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output1: 100/100**
- Valid markdown table syntax throughout

- Table names follow proper naming conventions

**DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output2: 100/100**
- Valid markdown table syntax throughout
- Consistent column alignment and proper pipe separators
- No syntax errors detected
- All field references are well-formed
- Entity names follow proper naming conventions

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output1 | DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output2 | Overall |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 25 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 95 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |

## Recommendations

1. **For DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output1**: Consider providing entity context documentation to clarify the relationship between Agreement and _ClickAgreement entities for comprehensive migration planning.

2. **For DI_DataMapping_Recommender_Output2**: Expand mapping complexity analysis to identify potential data transformation requirements even for direct field mappings.

3. **For Both Outputs**: Standardize entity naming conventions and consider consolidating mapping approaches for related entities to improve migration consistency.
