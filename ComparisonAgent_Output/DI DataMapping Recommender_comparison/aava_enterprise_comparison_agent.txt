| Failed (<85%)    | 0         | -                                      |

- Matching success rate is 100%—all files matched one-to-one.
- No unmatched or invalid files; completeness is absolute.
- No negative impact from unmatched files.
- Reliability of matched pair is fully supported by gate validation.

SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED

Line-by-line analysis was performed for both files. The match percentage formula is: (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100, rounded to one decimal place. Lines modified were counted as additions, deletions, or changes. Only valid one-to-one matched pairs received a match percentage; unmatched or invalid matches show "N/A."

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication        |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes         |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only    |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring        |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes      |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review    |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file      |

- Match percentage alone does not determine readiness.
- Dimension scores add depth and context to equivalence.
- Both metrics are required for migration approval.
- 90% is the threshold for a PASS.

- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:
1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation
6. Performance Patterns – Efficiency, scalability

8. Output Structure & Modularity – Organization, maintainability
9. Documentation Quality – Comments, docstrings
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence – Integration, outputs

Match Percentage Formula:
```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:
- PASS: >= 90%
- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%
- FAIL: < 75%
