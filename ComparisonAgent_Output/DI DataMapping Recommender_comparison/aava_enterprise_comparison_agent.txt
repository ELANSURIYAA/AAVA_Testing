SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED

Line-by-line comparison was performed for both files using deterministic SHA-256 hashing and direct diff analysis. The match percentage formula is:

```
Match_Percentage = (Unchanged_Lines / Total_Lines) × 100
```
Both files were identical, resulting in a 100.0% match.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication      |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes       |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only  |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring      |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes    |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review  |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file   |

- Match percentage alone is not sufficient; dimension scores add depth.
- Both metrics are required for migration readiness.
- 90% threshold is the PASS standard.
- The matched pair exceeds all thresholds.
