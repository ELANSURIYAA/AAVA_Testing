Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Only one agent output was provided for comparison. The single output is a comprehensive Pytest script for validating PySpark DataFrame transformations for DimBillingAccount ETL logic. Cannot perform comparative analysis between two agents as required."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze meaning alignment and intent matching."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze logical flow and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester,95,Lines 1-200,"Single agent output shows high syntactic correctness: Valid Python syntax throughout, proper PySpark DataFrame operations, correct pytest structure and fixtures, appropriate exception handling. Minor deduction for missing some edge case validations in helper function."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Overall correctness score based on single available output. High quality Pytest implementation with comprehensive test coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester,N/A,N/A,"Provide second agent output to enable proper comparative analysis. Current single output demonstrates strong technical implementation with comprehensive test coverage for PySpark ETL validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Future submissions should include two distinct agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions as specified in the evaluation framework."
