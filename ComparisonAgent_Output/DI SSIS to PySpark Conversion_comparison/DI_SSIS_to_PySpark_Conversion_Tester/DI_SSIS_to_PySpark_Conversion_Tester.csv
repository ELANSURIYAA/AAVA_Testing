Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Only one agent output provided for comparison. Cannot perform meaningful comparison between two different agents. The single output is a comprehensive Pytest script for validating PySpark DataFrame transformations in SSIS-to-PySpark conversion with 10 test cases covering happy path, null handling, empty DataFrames, schema validation, type mismatches, duplicate handling, business logic validation, derived columns, aggregations, and performance testing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze meaning alignment and intent similarity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze logical flow and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Single_Output,95,"Lines 15-25, 85-90, 150-155","Pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure. Minor issues: Line 85 uses undefined 'UpdateTime' column reference that may cause runtime errors in some scenarios. Line 150-155 cache validation logic could be more robust. Overall well-structured with comprehensive test coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Single_Output,N/A,"Line 85","Fix undefined 'UpdateTime' column reference by adding proper column existence check or using coalesce with literal null."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Single_Output,N/A,"Lines 150-155","Enhance cache validation logic to use more reliable methods for checking DataFrame cache status."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To enable proper comparison analysis, provide two distinct agent outputs addressing the same task or problem domain."
