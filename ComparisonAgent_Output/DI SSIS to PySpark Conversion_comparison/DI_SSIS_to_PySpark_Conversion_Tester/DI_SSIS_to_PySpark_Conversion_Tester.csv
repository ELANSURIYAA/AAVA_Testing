Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison cannot be performed as only one agent output was provided. The single output is a comprehensive Pytest script for DimBillingAccount ETL validation with 10 test cases covering happy path scenarios, null handling, empty DataFrames, schema validation, type mismatches, duplicate handling, IsActive logic, derived columns, aggregation, and performance testing. The script includes proper fixtures, helper functions, and follows pytest best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - requires two agent outputs for comparison"
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity - requires two agent outputs for comparison"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester,95,Lines 1-200,"Single output shows high syntactic correctness: valid Python/Pytest syntax, proper imports, well-structured fixtures, comprehensive test cases with appropriate assertions. Minor deduction for some hardcoded values and potential optimization opportunities in test data setup."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide second agent output for meaningful comparison. 2. The existing Pytest script demonstrates excellent test coverage and structure. 3. Consider parameterizing test data for better maintainability. 4. Add performance benchmarking assertions for TC10. 5. Include integration tests with actual Spark cluster configurations."
