# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Only one agent output was provided for comparison. The single output is a comprehensive Pytest script for validating PySpark DataFrame transformations for DimBillingAccount ETL logic. Cannot perform comparative analysis between two agents as required by the evaluation framework.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze meaning alignment and intent matching.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity - only one agent output provided. Comparison requires two distinct outputs to analyze logical flow and decomposition approaches.

### Correctness
**DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester: 95/100**
- Lines 1-200: Single agent output shows high syntactic correctness
- Valid Python syntax throughout
- Proper PySpark DataFrame operations
- Correct pytest structure and fixtures
- Appropriate exception handling
- Minor deduction for missing some edge case validations in helper function

**Overall: 95/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester | Overall |
|--------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | 95 | 95 |
| **Overall** | **95** | **95** |

## Recommendations

1. **For DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Conversion_Tester**: Provide second agent output to enable proper comparative analysis. Current single output demonstrates strong technical implementation with comprehensive test coverage for PySpark ETL validation.

2. **For Future Submissions**: Future submissions should include two distinct agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions as specified in the evaluation framework.
