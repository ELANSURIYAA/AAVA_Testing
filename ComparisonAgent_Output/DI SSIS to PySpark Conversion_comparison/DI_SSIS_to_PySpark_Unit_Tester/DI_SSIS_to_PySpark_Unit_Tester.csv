Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison analysis cannot be completed as only one agent output was provided. The available output is a comprehensive Pytest suite for PySpark DataFrame validation with 10 test cases covering various scenarios including happy path, null handling, empty DataFrames, schema validation, type mismatches, duplicate handling, business logic validation, aggregation testing, and performance considerations. The output demonstrates high quality with proper test structure, comprehensive coverage, and professional documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as only one output (DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester) is available for comparison. A second agent output is required to perform semantic similarity analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity as only one output (DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester) is available for comparison. A second agent output is required to perform structural similarity analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-50, 80-85","The Pytest suite demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, well-structured fixtures, and valid PySpark operations. Minor deductions for: (1) Missing explicit error type specifications in some exception tests (lines 200-210), (2) Some hardcoded values that could be parameterized (lines 45-50), (3) Limited assertion variety in some test cases (lines 150-160). Overall structure follows Pytest best practices with appropriate use of fixtures and test organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"No second agent output provided for correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Overall correctness score based on single available output: 95/100. The provided Pytest suite shows high technical quality with comprehensive test coverage and proper PySpark testing patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester,N/A,"Lines 200-210, 45-50","1. Add specific exception type assertions in error handling tests (e.g., pytest.raises(AnalysisException)) instead of generic Exception. 2. Parameterize hardcoded test data values to improve test maintainability. 3. Add more diverse assertion types beyond basic equality checks. 4. Consider adding performance benchmarking assertions for caching and partitioning tests."
