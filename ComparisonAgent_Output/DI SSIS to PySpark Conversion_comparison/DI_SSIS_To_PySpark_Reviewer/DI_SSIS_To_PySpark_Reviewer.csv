Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-95 vs Line 1,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Agent 1 provides a comprehensive 95-line SSIS to PySpark conversion review with detailed analysis across 7 sections, while Agent 2 provides only a single-line thought statement. The outputs represent completely different approaches - one being a complete deliverable and the other being an incomplete process note."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-95 vs Line 1,"Both outputs relate to SSIS to PySpark conversion review, but Agent 1 delivers a complete comprehensive analysis while Agent 2 only states an intention to perform the work. The semantic overlap is minimal as one is a finished product and the other is a preliminary thought. Agent 1 covers all required aspects (overview, functionality, performance, testing, recommendations) while Agent 2 provides no actual analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-95 vs Line 1,"Agent 1 follows a structured 7-section format with clear headings, subsections, and logical flow from overview through conclusion. Agent 2 has no structure - it's a single thought statement. The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible with no meaningful overlap in organization or presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-95,"Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper section headers, consistent formatting, complete sentences, and logical organization. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in the summary section and a few areas where more specific line references could be provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,85,Line 1,"Agent 2 output is syntactically correct as a single sentence with proper grammar and punctuation. However, it's incomplete as a deliverable and lacks the structure expected for a comprehensive review report. The thought statement itself is well-formed but insufficient."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 85) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective scopes, though they serve very different purposes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 60-85,"Agent 1 provides excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed recommendations for improvement. Strengths include thorough coverage of all aspects, clear structure, and actionable suggestions. Could be enhanced with more specific metrics and quantitative assessments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Line 1,"Agent 2 needs to complete the actual review work. The thought statement indicates understanding of the task but no execution. Should develop the full analysis covering all required sections: overview, functionality assessment, performance analysis, code quality review, testing results, and recommendations."
