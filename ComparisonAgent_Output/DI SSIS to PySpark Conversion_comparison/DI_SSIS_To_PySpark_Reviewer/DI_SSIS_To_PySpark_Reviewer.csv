Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 1-25","Both outputs provide comprehensive SSIS to PySpark migration assessments with similar overall conclusions. Agent 1 provides a more structured and detailed analysis with clear sections and comprehensive coverage. Agent 2 appears to be a truncated or summary version with less detail but covers similar key points about conversion accuracy and recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-200, 1-50","Both outputs address the same core objective of assessing SSIS to PySpark migration quality. They share similar conclusions about conversion accuracy (9/10 rating), identify similar issues with InsuredInfo join logic and error handling, and provide comparable recommendations. Agent 1 provides more comprehensive coverage of testing, performance, and scalability aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-200, 1-50","Agent 1 follows a structured 7-section format (Overview, Functionality, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Recommendations, Conclusion) with clear subsections. Agent 2 has a more condensed structure with summary sections but lacks the detailed organizational framework. Both conclude with similar assessment patterns but Agent 1 provides more systematic coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 1-200","Agent 1 output is well-formed with consistent section numbering, proper formatting, clear subsection organization, and comprehensive coverage. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points but overall excellent structure and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,90,"Lines 1-50","Agent 2 output is syntactically correct but appears incomplete or truncated. The content present is well-formed but lacks the comprehensive structure and detail expected for a complete migration assessment report."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs are syntactically sound with Agent 1 being more complete and Agent 2 being more concise but potentially incomplete."
