Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two distinct approaches to SSIS-to-PySpark conversion analysis were compared. Output_1 provides a comprehensive technical review report with structured sections covering functionality, performance, testing, and recommendations. Output_2 presents a methodological thought process for conducting such reviews. The outputs serve different purposes - one being a complete deliverable and the other being a process framework."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-10","The outputs address fundamentally different aspects of SSIS-to-PySpark conversion. Output_1 focuses on actual technical assessment results while Output_2 focuses on methodology. Both relate to the same domain but serve different purposes - assessment vs. process definition."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-200 vs Lines 1-10","Output_1 follows a structured report format with numbered sections (1-7) including Overview, Functionality Assessment, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Recommendations, and Conclusion. Output_2 is a brief methodological statement. The structural approaches are completely different - comprehensive report vs. process description."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 45-50","Well-structured technical report with proper section numbering, comprehensive coverage of all assessment areas, and detailed analysis. Minor issues: some placeholder content mentioned for InsuredInfo logic refinement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,85,"Lines 1-10","Brief but syntactically correct methodological description. Content is accurate but extremely limited in scope compared to what would be expected for a comprehensive analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective scopes. Output_1 provides comprehensive technical detail while Output_2 provides basic methodology."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Excellent comprehensive technical review that covers all critical aspects of SSIS-to-PySpark migration. Provides actionable recommendations and detailed assessment across functionality, performance, and quality dimensions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"While methodologically sound, this output lacks the depth and detail expected for a comprehensive conversion analysis. Should be expanded to include actual technical assessment, testing results, and specific recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"For future comparisons, ensure both outputs address the same scope and depth of analysis. Output_1 demonstrates the expected level of detail for technical migration assessments."
