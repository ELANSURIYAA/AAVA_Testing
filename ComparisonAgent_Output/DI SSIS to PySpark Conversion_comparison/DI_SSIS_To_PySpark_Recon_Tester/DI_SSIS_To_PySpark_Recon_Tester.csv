Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive testing frameworks for SSIS to PySpark ETL validation with high semantic alignment (92/100), strong structural similarity (88/100), and excellent correctness (96/100 average). The outputs demonstrate sophisticated understanding of ETL testing requirements with minor variations in implementation approach and test case organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs address identical core objectives: automated reconciliation between SSIS and PySpark ETL outputs for DimBillingAccount. Both include comprehensive test case documentation, pytest implementation, and validation logic. Key semantic alignments include: data validation approaches, transformation testing, performance metrics, error handling, and configurability. Minor semantic differences in test case naming conventions and specific validation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-30, 51-80, 121-200","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: header/metadata, test cases table, pytest script implementation. Both organize content into documentation and code sections. Structural differences include: Agent 1 uses more granular test case IDs (TC01-TC10), Agent 2 uses TC001-TC010 format; Agent 1 includes more detailed fixture setup, Agent 2 includes configuration management and reporting sections. Both maintain logical flow from documentation to implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 51-200","Excellent syntax correctness in pytest implementation. All imports properly structured, fixture definitions complete, test functions well-formed. Minor issue: some test assertions could be more specific (line 180-185). All Python syntax valid, proper use of pytest decorators and fixtures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,94,"Lines 51-250","Strong syntax correctness overall. Proper pytest structure, valid Python syntax, good use of configuration management. Minor issues: some undefined variables in helper functions (lines 120-130), potential import issues with yaml module not explicitly handled. Configuration file example well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,"","Average correctness score reflecting high quality implementation in both outputs with minor syntax/reference issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 180-185","Enhance test assertions with more specific validation criteria and error messages. Consider adding configuration management similar to Agent 2 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 120-130","Address undefined variable references in helper functions. Add explicit error handling for configuration file loading and yaml import dependencies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs demonstrate excellent understanding of ETL testing requirements. Consider combining Agent 1's detailed fixture approach with Agent 2's configuration management for optimal implementation. Both frameworks provide solid foundation for automated SSIS-PySpark reconciliation testing."
