Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs deliver comprehensive testing frameworks for SSIS-PySpark ETL reconciliation with strong semantic alignment (85/100) and similar structural approaches (78/100). ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt focuses on direct PySpark transformation testing with mock data fixtures, while DI_SSIS_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester emphasizes comparative analysis between actual SSIS and PySpark outputs. Both demonstrate excellent syntax correctness (95/100 average). Key differences include test case organization, configuration management, and validation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs address identical core objectives of ETL reconciliation testing between SSIS and PySpark for DimBillingAccount. ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt (lines 15-45) focuses on transformation logic validation using mock DataFrames, while DI_SSIS_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester (lines 20-40) emphasizes output comparison methodology. Both cover similar test scenarios including null handling, schema validation, performance testing, and edge cases. Semantic divergence occurs in implementation philosophy: direct transformation testing vs comparative analysis approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 51-100, 200-300","Both follow similar high-level organization with test cases documentation followed by Pytest implementation. ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt uses TC01-TC10 numbering (lines 51-80) with fixture-based approach, while DI_SSIS_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester uses TC001-TC010 numbering (lines 25-55) with configuration-driven methodology. Structural differences include: helper function organization, configuration management (YAML vs fixtures), and test execution flow. Both maintain logical test case progression from basic validation to complex scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt,96,"Lines 85-400","Excellent Python syntax with proper imports, valid PySpark DataFrame operations, and correct Pytest fixture usage. Minor issues: line 150 has unused import 'lit' that could be optimized, and line 280 DataFrame caching validation could be more robust. All function definitions are syntactically correct with proper type hints and error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester,94,"Lines 90-350","Strong Python syntax with comprehensive pandas operations and proper YAML configuration handling. Minor issues: line 180 has potential KeyError risk in config access without default values, line 220 file path handling could benefit from pathlib usage, and line 300 log file reading lacks error handling for missing files. Overall structure is well-formed with proper exception handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python code, proper imports, and well-structured test implementations. Average correctness score reflects minor optimization opportunities rather than functional defects."

Recommendations,Recommendation,ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt,,"Lines 150, 280","1. Remove unused 'lit' import to optimize code clarity. 2. Enhance DataFrame caching validation with more robust storage level checks. 3. Consider adding configuration-driven test case management for better maintainability. 4. Implement comparative analysis features to complement direct transformation testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SSIS_To_PySpark_Recon_Tester,,"Lines 180, 220, 300","1. Add default value handling for config access to prevent KeyError exceptions. 2. Migrate to pathlib for more robust file path operations. 3. Implement error handling for log file operations to handle missing files gracefully. 4. Consider adding direct transformation testing capabilities to complement comparative analysis approach."
