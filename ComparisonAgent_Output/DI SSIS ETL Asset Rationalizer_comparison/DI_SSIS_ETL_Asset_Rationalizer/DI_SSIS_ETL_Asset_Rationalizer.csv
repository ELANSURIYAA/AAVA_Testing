Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,100,All lines,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs are completely identical JSON structures containing comprehensive ETL asset rationalization analysis. The outputs demonstrate perfect semantic alignment with identical asset counts (10 pipelines, 10 data flows, 15 tables), identical dependency mappings, and identical recommendations for consolidation, optimization, and removal of orphaned components."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,All lines,"Both outputs express identical intent and meaning for ETL asset rationalization. They identify the same redundancies in dimension loading patterns, the same orphaned audit tables, and propose identical optimization strategies. The semantic content is perfectly aligned with no conceptual differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,All lines,"Both outputs follow identical JSON structure with Summary, Rationalization Analysis, and Recommendations sections. The hierarchical organization, array structures for dependencies and table usage, and categorization of findings (Redundancies, OrphanedComponents, Inefficiencies, OtherFindings) are perfectly matched."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All lines,"Agent_1 output contains valid JSON syntax with proper nesting, correct array structures, and consistent field naming. All references between sections are internally consistent with no syntax errors or malformed elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All lines,"Agent_2 output contains valid JSON syntax with proper nesting, correct array structures, and consistent field naming. All references between sections are internally consistent with no syntax errors or malformed elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON formatting, proper escaping, and consistent structure throughout all sections."
