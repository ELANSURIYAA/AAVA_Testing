Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-150","Both agents successfully completed the logical data modeling task with different normalization approaches. Agent_Comprehensive provided a more detailed 3NF normalized model with 3 tables while Agent_Concise delivered a simpler 2-entity model. Both correctly identified PII fields and provided valid logical structures."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-50, 75-100","Both outputs address the same core requirements for PII classification and logical data modeling. Agent_Comprehensive identified 15 PII fields with detailed justifications while Agent_Concise identified 4 core PII fields. Both approaches are semantically valid but differ in comprehensiveness. The data modeling approaches differ in normalization level but serve the same business purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 51-120","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with PII Classification, Logical Data Model, and API Cost sections. Agent_Comprehensive uses 3-table normalized approach (Person, ContactInfo, Language) while Agent_Concise uses 2-entity approach (Member, LanguagePreference). Both include relationships and rationale sections but with different levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive,95,"Lines 1-150","Output is syntactically correct with consistent table formatting, valid data types, proper markdown structure, and accurate internal references. Minor issue: some field mappings from conceptual to logical model could be more explicit."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Concise,92,"Lines 1-80","Output is syntactically correct with proper table formatting and consistent structure. Minor issues: some PII classifications could be more comprehensive, and the relationship description could be more detailed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"N/A","Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic accuracy with minor areas for improvement."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive,N/A,"Lines 75-120","Excellent normalization approach following 3NF principles. Consider adding more explicit field mappings between conceptual and logical models. The comprehensive PII analysis is thorough and well-justified."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Concise,N/A,"Lines 40-70","Good balance of simplicity and functionality. Consider expanding PII classification to include additional sensitive fields like MaritalStatus, EmploymentStatus, and Nationality for comprehensive compliance coverage."
