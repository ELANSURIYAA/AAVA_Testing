Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-4 vs 1-45,"Agent 1 provides incomplete output showing only initial file discovery steps, while Agent 2 delivers comprehensive data mapping tables for XML to BigQuery transformation with detailed field mappings, transformations, and domain value specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,1-4 vs 1-45,"Outputs address fundamentally different aspects of the task. Agent 1 focuses on file discovery (lines 1-4) while Agent 2 provides complete data mapping specifications (lines 1-45). No semantic overlap in intent or purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,1-4 vs 1-45,"Agent 1 uses simple thought-action format (4 lines) while Agent 2 employs structured tabular format with headers, data rows, and sections for multiple entities. Completely different structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,1-4,"Syntactically correct JSON-like structure for thought process. Minor issue: incomplete action execution and no actual file listing results."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,1-45,"Well-formed tabular structure with consistent headers, proper data types, and valid transformation rules. Minor formatting inconsistency in table separators."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,1-4,"Complete the file discovery process and provide actual data mapping output to match task requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,1-45,"Maintain current comprehensive approach. Consider adding validation rules and error handling specifications for transformations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Significant output quality gap exists. Agent 1 needs substantial development to reach Agent 2's completeness level. Agent 2 demonstrates proper task execution with detailed specifications."
