Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs are syntactically valid Mermaid ER diagrams representing person/member data models. Agent 1 provides a more comprehensive healthcare-focused model with detailed attributes and normalized contact/language entities. Agent 2 offers a simpler member-centric model with basic attributes and language preferences. Semantic alignment is moderate (65%) as both represent person data but with different scopes. Structural similarity is low (45%) due to different normalization approaches. Both achieve perfect correctness (100%) with valid Mermaid syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-25","Both models represent person/member data in healthcare contexts. Agent 1 (Person entity) includes comprehensive healthcare attributes like InsuranceProviderName, HealthcareProviderName, MaritalStatus, EmploymentStatus, EducationLevel. Agent 2 (Member entity) focuses on basic member information with InsuranceProvider and PrimaryCarePhysician. Common semantic elements include: demographics (DateOfBirth, Gender, Race, Ethnicity), contact information, and language preferences. However, Agent 1 has broader scope with employment, education, and emergency contacts while Agent 2 is more healthcare-member specific."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-25","Significant structural differences exist. Agent 1 uses normalized design with separate ContactInfo and Language entities (lines 15-25) connected via one-to-one relationships. Agent 2 embeds contact info directly in Member entity (lines 4-7) and uses separate LanguagePreference entity (lines 12-16) with one-to-many relationship. Agent 1 has 3 entities with 2 relationships, Agent 2 has 2 entities with 1 relationship. Different primary key naming conventions: PersonID vs MemberID."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,"Lines 1-25","Perfect Mermaid syntax. Valid erDiagram declaration, proper entity definitions with correct attribute syntax (type name constraints), valid relationship syntax using ||--|| notation. All entities properly closed with braces. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,"Lines 1-16","Perfect Mermaid syntax. Valid erDiagram declaration, proper entity definitions with correct attribute syntax, valid relationship syntax using ||--o{ notation for one-to-many. All entities properly closed with braces. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid Mermaid ER diagram syntax, proper entity definitions, and correct relationship notations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 1-25","Excellent comprehensive model suitable for enterprise healthcare systems. Consider adding indexes or constraints annotations for implementation guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 1-16","Good simplified model for member management systems. Consider expanding with additional demographic fields if broader healthcare context is needed."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-25","Both models serve different use cases effectively. Agent 1 for comprehensive patient management, Agent 2 for focused member services. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 1's comprehensive attributes with Agent 2's simpler structure for optimal balance."
