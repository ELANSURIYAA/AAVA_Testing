Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of SSIS design patterns with Java Spark optimization recommendations. Agent 1 delivers a narrative-driven approach with 6 primary and 2 secondary patterns using descriptive names like 'Master-Child Package Orchestration' and 'Dimension Table SCD Type 1 Processing'. Agent 2 provides a more technical approach with 7 coded patterns using notation like 'ST-JL-TAG-TAC-TT' with precise frequency metrics (70%, 60%, etc.). While both identify similar underlying ETL patterns, they differ significantly in presentation methodology and analytical depth. Agent 1 focuses on architectural concepts and workflow orchestration, while Agent 2 emphasizes technical pattern frequency and file-specific mappings."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs address SSIS pattern analysis and Spark migration recommendations but with different conceptual frameworks. Agent 1 identifies patterns like 'Master-Child Package Orchestration' (lines 10-25) and 'Dimension Table SCD Type 1 Processing' (lines 26-41), focusing on business logic and architectural concepts. Agent 2 uses technical notation 'ST-JL-TAG-TAC-TT' (lines 8-18) representing source-join-aggregate-arithmetic-target operations. Both recognize similar underlying ETL processes but conceptualize them differently. Agent 1's 'Fact Table Loading with Multiple Dimension Lookups' (lines 42-57) aligns with Agent 2's complex multi-stage patterns (lines 85-95). However, Agent 1 emphasizes workflow orchestration and error handling while Agent 2 focuses on operational sequences and frequency analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,Lines 1-200,"Significant structural differences exist between the outputs. Agent 1 follows a narrative structure with JSON formatting, organizing content into primary_patterns, secondary_patterns, and pattern_combinations sections (lines 5-180). Each pattern includes description, files, spark_suitability, and recommendations arrays. Agent 2 uses a more tabular approach with pattern_summary (lines 5-75) and detailed_patterns (lines 76-200) sections, emphasizing frequency metrics and percentage calculations. Agent 1 provides hierarchical organization with nested recommendations, while Agent 2 maintains flat pattern descriptions with consistent field structures. Both include file mappings and Spark recommendations but organize this information using fundamentally different schemas."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Lines 5-180,"Agent 1 demonstrates excellent JSON syntax with proper nesting, consistent field naming, and valid array structures. All JSON brackets and braces are properly matched. Pattern descriptions are comprehensive and technically accurate. Minor issue: some recommendation arrays could benefit from more consistent formatting (lines 20-24, 35-39). All file references are properly quoted and structured. Spark recommendations are technically sound and well-articulated."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,Lines 5-200,"Agent 2 shows superior structural consistency with perfectly formatted JSON throughout. All pattern frequencies sum correctly, percentages are mathematically accurate, and file arrays are consistently structured. Pattern notation (ST-JL-TAG-TAC-TT) is systematically applied. Field naming is consistent across all pattern objects. Spark recommendations are technically precise and well-organized. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid JSON formatting and consistent internal structure. Agent 2 slightly edges out with more systematic consistency in field organization and mathematical accuracy in frequency calculations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 20-24,"Enhance structural consistency in recommendation formatting. Consider adding frequency metrics to complement the narrative approach. Standardize field naming conventions across all pattern objects to improve machine readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 85-95,"Expand pattern descriptions to include more architectural context beyond operational sequences. Consider adding pattern combination analysis to show how individual patterns work together in complete ETL workflows. Include more detailed error handling and audit trail patterns."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from hybrid approaches - combining Agent 1's architectural depth with Agent 2's systematic frequency analysis. Consider standardizing pattern naming conventions to enable better cross-reference and comparison. Both should include more specific code examples for Spark implementations to make recommendations more actionable."
