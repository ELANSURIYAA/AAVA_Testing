Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive DB2 to Synapse SQL conversion reviews with high semantic alignment (85/100) and strong structural similarity (78/100). Agent_JSON_Format achieves 95% correctness with clean JSON structure, while Agent_Markdown_Format scores 92% with minor formatting inconsistencies. Overall assessment: 85/100 - both outputs are production-ready with complementary strengths."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both agents address the same core objective: reviewing DB2 to Synapse SQL conversion accuracy. Agent_JSON_Format focuses on conversion accuracy (90%), discrepancies in transaction handling, and optimization suggestions for columnstore indexes. Agent_Markdown_Format provides similar insights with 98% functionality retention, identical discrepancy identification (identity columns, stored procedures, transactions), and comparable optimization recommendations. Key semantic alignment: both identify transaction syntax differences (BEGIN vs BEGIN TRANSACTION), stored procedure parameter syntax (@prefix), and recommend columnstore indexes and data distribution strategies. Minor divergence: Agent_JSON_Format emphasizes error handling gaps more strongly, while Agent_Markdown_Format provides more detailed feature-by-feature comparison table."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,All,"Agent_JSON_Format uses structured JSON with 7 numbered sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, API Cost). Agent_Markdown_Format employs markdown sections with headers, detailed comparison table, and test case coverage analysis. Both follow logical progression: summary → accuracy assessment → issue identification → optimization → recommendations. Structural differences: Agent_JSON_Format uses numbered keys and nested bullet points, Agent_Markdown_Format uses hierarchical headers and tabular data. Flow similarity: both start with executive summary, analyze conversion accuracy, detail discrepancies, suggest optimizations, and conclude with recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_JSON_Format,95,Lines 1-20,"Valid JSON structure with proper key-value pairs, consistent formatting, and complete sections. Minor issue: Line 3 contains 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' which appears to be a placeholder or encoding artifact that should be 'report'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Markdown_Format,92,Lines 15-25,"Well-formed markdown with proper headers, tables, and formatting. Issues: Line 15 has inconsistent spacing in bullet points, Line 23 contains incomplete sentence fragment 'with platform-specific syntax.', and some table alignment could be improved for better readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,All,"Average correctness score of 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor formatting issues that don't impact content quality or usability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_JSON_Format,N/A,Lines 16-18,"Strengthen error handling discussion with specific Synapse TRY/CATCH examples. Consider adding more detailed performance benchmarking recommendations. Expand on schema mapping documentation suggestions with concrete examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Markdown_Format,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Improve table formatting consistency and complete sentence fragments. Add more quantitative metrics to support the 98% accuracy claim. Consider integrating the detailed comparison table earlier in the flow for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Including actual code examples for syntax differences, 2) Adding specific performance metrics or benchmarks, 3) Providing step-by-step migration checklists, 4) Including risk assessment matrices for production deployment."
