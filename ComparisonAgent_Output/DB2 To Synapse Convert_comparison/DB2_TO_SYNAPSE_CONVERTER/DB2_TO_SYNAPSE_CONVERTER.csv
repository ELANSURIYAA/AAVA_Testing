Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Two Azure Synapse SQL outputs with fundamentally different scopes and complexity. DB2_Converter_Agent_1 provides a simple customer query (3 lines), while DB2_Converter_Agent_2 delivers a comprehensive database script (45 lines) including table creation, data insertion, queries, stored procedures, and transactions. Both are syntactically correct but serve entirely different purposes, resulting in low semantic and structural similarity despite high individual correctness scores."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Both outputs are Azure Synapse SQL code but address completely different use cases. DB2_Converter_Agent_1 focuses solely on querying existing customer data with filtering and sorting (lines 1-3). DB2_Converter_Agent_2 provides a full database implementation including schema creation, sample data population, complex queries with joins, stored procedures, and transaction handling (lines 1-45). The semantic intent diverges significantly - simple data retrieval vs. comprehensive database setup and management."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Structural approaches are fundamentally different. DB2_Converter_Agent_1 uses a single SELECT statement with TOP, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses (lines 1-3). DB2_Converter_Agent_2 employs a multi-phase structure: table creation (lines 3-9, 19-23), data insertion (lines 11-15, 25-29), queries (lines 17, 31-34), stored procedure definition (lines 36-42), procedure execution (line 44), and transaction management (lines 46-50). No structural overlap exists between the simple query and complex script architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_Converter_Agent_1,95,Lines 1-3,"Syntactically correct Azure Synapse SQL with proper SELECT TOP syntax, valid WHERE clause with comparison operator, and correct ORDER BY with DESC. Minor consideration: assumes CUSTOMER table and specified columns exist in target schema."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_Converter_Agent_2,98,Lines 1-45,"Comprehensive and syntactically correct Azure Synapse SQL script. Proper table creation with IDENTITY, constraints, and data types (lines 3-9, 19-23). Valid INSERT statements with explicit column specification (lines 11-15, 25-29). Correct JOIN syntax and stored procedure creation (lines 31-42). Proper transaction handling with BEGIN/COMMIT (lines 46-50). Minor consideration: JOIN assumes matching values between EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT and DEPARTMENTS.DEPT_NAME without explicit foreign key constraint."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic accuracy for Azure Synapse SQL with only minor schema assumption considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DB2_Converter_Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-3,"Consider expanding the simple query to include error handling, parameterization for dynamic filtering, and additional business logic to match the comprehensive approach demonstrated by the second agent."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DB2_Converter_Agent_2,N/A,Lines 31-34,"Add explicit foreign key constraints between EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables to ensure referential integrity instead of relying on string matching in the JOIN condition."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Significant scope alignment needed. Establish clear requirements for output complexity and functionality. Consider whether the task requires simple query conversion or comprehensive database script migration from DB2 to Azure Synapse."
