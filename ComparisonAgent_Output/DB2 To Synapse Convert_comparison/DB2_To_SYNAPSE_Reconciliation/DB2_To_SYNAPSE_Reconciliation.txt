# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents produced comprehensive test documentation with accompanying pytest scripts. Agent 1 focuses on testing a specific Synapse SQL query for customer balance retrieval, while Agent 2 tests complete database table operations including DDL, DML, and stored procedures. The outputs serve different testing purposes but follow similar documentation and implementation patterns.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 25/100)

The outputs address fundamentally different testing scenarios. Agent 1 tests a single SQL query operation (SELECT TOP 10 with WHERE and ORDER BY clauses) while Agent 2 tests comprehensive database operations including table creation, data manipulation, joins, stored procedures, and transactions. The semantic intent and purpose are completely different despite both being database-related test suites.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 1: Focused on query result validation and performance testing
- Agent 2: Comprehensive database schema and operation testing
- Different business contexts and testing objectives

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs follow a consistent two-part structure: test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. Both use similar test case ID patterns (TC01, TC02, etc.), include descriptions, input data, and expected outputs. The pytest scripts both use fixtures, helper functions, and similar test organization patterns. However, Agent 1 focuses on variations of a single query while Agent 2 covers diverse database operations.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Consistent test case documentation format
- Similar pytest fixture patterns and organization
- Both include setup/teardown mechanisms
- Comparable error handling test approaches

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**
Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper test case documentation and valid pytest code. Minor issues include placeholder connection string values (lines 45-47) that need customization and assumption about table structure in comments (lines 89-91). The SQL syntax is valid and the pytest structure follows best practices.

**Agent 2 (Score: 92/100)**
Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with comprehensive test coverage. Minor issues include placeholder connection string values (lines 156-158) and some SQL statements that use EXEC with string concatenation for dynamic procedure creation (lines 201-203) which could be improved. The overall structure and syntax are valid.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 94/100)**
Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with only minor placeholder and implementation detail issues that are typical in template code.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 25 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 78 |
| Correctness | 95 | 92 | 94 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **66** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
- Update connection string placeholders with actual values (lines 45-47)
- Verify table schema assumptions match the target environment

**For Agent 2:**
- Replace connection string placeholders (lines 156-158, 201-203)
- Consider using parameterized stored procedure creation instead of dynamic SQL with EXEC for better security and maintainability

**For Both Agents:**
- Both outputs would benefit from environment-specific configuration management and additional error handling for database connection failures
