Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive test documentation with accompanying pytest scripts. Agent 1 focuses on testing a specific Synapse SQL query for customer balance retrieval, while Agent 2 tests complete database table operations including DDL, DML, and stored procedures. The outputs serve different testing purposes but follow similar documentation and implementation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"","The outputs address fundamentally different testing scenarios. Agent 1 tests a single SQL query operation (SELECT TOP 10 with WHERE and ORDER BY clauses) while Agent 2 tests comprehensive database operations including table creation, data manipulation, joins, stored procedures, and transactions. The semantic intent and purpose are completely different despite both being database-related test suites."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"","Both outputs follow a consistent two-part structure: test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. Both use similar test case ID patterns (TC01, TC02, etc.), include descriptions, input data, and expected outputs. The pytest scripts both use fixtures, helper functions, and similar test organization patterns. However, Agent 1 focuses on variations of a single query while Agent 2 covers diverse database operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45-47, 89-91","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper test case documentation and valid pytest code. Minor issues include placeholder connection string values that need customization and assumption about table structure in comments. The SQL syntax is valid and the pytest structure follows best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 156-158, 201-203","Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with comprehensive test coverage. Minor issues include placeholder connection string values and some SQL statements that use EXEC with string concatenation for dynamic procedure creation which could be improved. The overall structure and syntax are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with only minor placeholder and implementation detail issues that are typical in template code."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 45-47","Update connection string placeholders with actual values and verify table schema assumptions match the target environment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 156-158, 201-203","Replace connection string placeholders and consider using parameterized stored procedure creation instead of dynamic SQL with EXEC for better security and maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs would benefit from environment-specific configuration management and additional error handling for database connection failures."
