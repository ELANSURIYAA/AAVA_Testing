Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two distinct unit testing approaches for DB2 to Synapse conversion. Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing focuses on a single query with CUSTOMER table filtering and TOP 10 selection. Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing provides comprehensive database operations testing including table creation, CRUD operations, joins, stored procedures, and constraints. Both outputs are syntactically correct but address fundamentally different testing scenarios with minimal semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,All,"Both outputs address unit testing for DB2 to Synapse conversion but target completely different database schemas and operations. Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing tests a specific SELECT query with filtering and ordering on CUSTOMER table. Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing covers comprehensive database operations on EMPLOYEES/DEPARTMENTS schema. The semantic intent diverges significantly - one is query-specific testing, the other is full database lifecycle testing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,All,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by pytest implementation. However, Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing uses 6 focused test cases (TC01-TC06) while Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing uses 12 comprehensive test cases (TC01-TC12). Both use pytest fixtures for database connection and setup/teardown, but Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing has more sophisticated transaction handling and constraint testing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing,95,Lines 45-47,"Syntactically correct pytest implementation with proper fixtures, connection handling, and test structure. Minor issue: connection string placeholder needs actual values. All SQL queries are valid Synapse syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing,92,Lines 15-17 and 89-91,"Well-structured pytest implementation with comprehensive test coverage. Minor issues: connection string placeholder needs actual values, and dynamic SQL execution in stored procedure creation could be simplified. All SQL DDL and DML statements are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure, valid SQL syntax, and appropriate error handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing,N/A,Lines 45-47,"Replace connection string placeholders with actual Synapse connection details. Consider adding more edge cases like NULL handling and data type boundary testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing,N/A,Lines 15-17,"Replace connection string placeholders with actual values. Simplify stored procedure creation by avoiding dynamic SQL. Add more performance benchmarks for complex joins."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs serve different purposes and should be maintained separately. Agent_1_CUSTOMER_Testing is suitable for specific query validation while Agent_2_EMPLOYEES_Testing provides comprehensive database testing framework. Consider standardizing connection management and error handling patterns across both approaches."
