# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent **DB2_to_Azure_Synapse_Migration_Documentation** provides comprehensive migration documentation with detailed schema analysis, query breakdowns, and strategic recommendations. Agent **SQL_Code_Implementation** provides executable SQL scripts with table creation, data manipulation, and procedural code. Both outputs address database migration scenarios but serve different purposes - documentation vs implementation.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address DB2 database migration scenarios with identical table structures (EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS) and similar business logic. Agent DB2_to_Azure_Synapse_Migration_Documentation focuses on migration strategy and analysis while Agent SQL_Code_Implementation provides direct code implementation. Semantic alignment is strong in database schema and business operations but differs in delivery approach.

**Key Alignments:**
- Both define EMPLOYEES table with same columns (EMP_ID, NAME, DEPARTMENT, SALARY, JOIN_DATE)
- Both include DEPARTMENTS table with matching structure
- Both implement UPDATE_SALARY stored procedure with identical parameters
- Both handle transaction scenarios with salary updates and employee deletions

**Divergences:**
- Agent 1 provides analytical context while Agent 2 focuses on executable implementation
- Agent 1 includes migration recommendations while Agent 2 demonstrates direct SQL execution

### Structural Similarity (Score: 45/100)

Agent DB2_to_Azure_Synapse_Migration_Documentation follows structured documentation format with numbered sections, tables, and analysis blocks. Agent SQL_Code_Implementation follows sequential SQL script structure with comments. Both cover similar database components (tables, procedures, transactions) but use fundamentally different organizational approaches - analytical documentation vs executable script flow.

**Structural Differences:**
- Agent 1: Section-based documentation (Schema → Analysis → Procedures → Recommendations)
- Agent 2: Sequential script execution (CREATE → INSERT → SELECT → PROCEDURE → TRANSACTION)
- Agent 1: Tabular schema presentation vs Agent 2: DDL statements
- Agent 1: Analytical commentary vs Agent 2: Inline code comments

### Correctness

**DB2_to_Azure_Synapse_Migration_Documentation (Score: 95/100)**
Documentation syntax is well-formed with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and valid SQL examples. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 23 where table alignment could be improved. All code snippets are syntactically valid.

**SQL_Code_Implementation (Score: 98/100)**
SQL syntax is correct throughout with proper DDL, DML, and procedural statements. All table definitions, insert statements, joins, and stored procedure syntax are valid. Minor consideration: line 28 comment formatting could be more consistent.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

## Recommendations

### For DB2_to_Azure_Synapse_Migration_Documentation
Enhance documentation with more specific Azure Synapse syntax examples and include performance benchmarking data. Consider adding code snippets for each migration recommendation to bridge the gap between analysis and implementation.

### For SQL_Code_Implementation  
Add comprehensive comments explaining migration-specific considerations and Azure Synapse adaptations. Include error handling and validation logic in stored procedures. Consider adding documentation blocks to explain business context and migration rationale.

### For Both Outputs
Combine strengths of both approaches: merge comprehensive documentation strategy with executable implementation examples. Create hybrid output that provides both analytical depth and practical code samples for complete migration guidance.
