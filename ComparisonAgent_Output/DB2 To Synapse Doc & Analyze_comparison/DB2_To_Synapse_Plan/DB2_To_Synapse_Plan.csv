Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation for DB2 to Synapse SQL migration including runtime costs, manual effort, and API costs. Agent 1 estimates $0.01 runtime cost with 5 hours total effort, while Agent 2 estimates $0.45 runtime cost with 7.5 hours effort. Both follow similar structural approaches but differ significantly in cost calculations and effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-10 (both agents)","Both outputs address the same core objective of cost estimation for DB2 to Synapse migration. They cover identical aspects: runtime costs, manual fixing effort, validation effort, and API costs. However, they differ substantially in cost calculations ($0.01 vs $0.45 runtime, 5 vs 7.5 hours effort) and underlying assumptions about data volume and complexity. The semantic intent is aligned but execution differs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Runtime cost estimation, 2) Manual code fixing effort, 3) Output validation effort, 4) Total effort calculation, 5) API cost, 6) Summary table. Agent 2 includes more detailed cluster configuration details (lines 3-5) and slightly more granular breakdowns, but overall flow and section organization are highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Syntactically correct with proper cost calculations, clear effort breakdowns, and consistent formatting. Minor issue: some inconsistency in effort reasoning (line 18 mentions 'no temporary tables' but line 25 discusses temp table handling). All numerical calculations are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent2,90,"Lines 8-12, 25-30","Syntactically correct with detailed technical specifications and proper table formatting. Minor issues include: inconsistent DBU pricing explanation (line 5 mentions mid-tier estimate without context) and some redundant phrasing in effort justifications (lines 25-28). All calculations are mathematically sound."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent1,,"Lines 1-50","Strengths: Conservative cost estimates, clear reasoning, concise presentation. Improvements needed: Reconcile temporary table mentions (lines 18 vs 25), provide more detailed cluster configuration assumptions, explain serverless vs dedicated pool choice rationale."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent2,,"Lines 1-60","Strengths: Detailed technical specifications, comprehensive cluster configuration, thorough effort breakdown. Improvements needed: Clarify DBU pricing context and assumptions, reduce redundant phrasing in effort justifications, align data volume estimates with cost calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost calculation methodology, 2) Clearer assumptions documentation, 3) Reconciliation of effort estimate differences, 4) More detailed validation criteria specification. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 1's conciseness with Agent 2's technical detail."
