# Agent Comparison Report: DB2 To Synapse Cost Estimation

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation for DB2 to Synapse SQL migration including runtime costs, manual effort, and API costs. **DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent1** estimates $0.01 runtime cost with 5 hours total effort, while **DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent2** estimates $0.45 runtime cost with 7.5 hours effort. Both follow similar structural approaches but differ significantly in cost calculations and effort estimates.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of cost estimation for DB2 to Synapse migration. They cover identical aspects: runtime costs, manual fixing effort, validation effort, and API costs. However, they differ substantially in cost calculations ($0.01 vs $0.45 runtime, 5 vs 7.5 hours effort) and underlying assumptions about data volume and complexity. The semantic intent is aligned but execution differs significantly in the quantitative assessments.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization:
1. Runtime cost estimation
2. Manual code fixing effort  
3. Output validation effort
4. Total effort calculation
5. API cost
6. Summary table

**DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent2** includes more detailed cluster configuration details (lines 3-5) and slightly more granular breakdowns, but overall flow and section organization are highly similar.

### Correctness

**DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent1 (Score: 95/100)**
- Syntactically correct with proper cost calculations, clear effort breakdowns, and consistent formatting
- Minor issue: some inconsistency in effort reasoning (line 18 mentions 'no temporary tables' but line 25 discusses temp table handling)
- All numerical calculations are internally consistent

**DB2_To_Synapse_Plan_Agent2 (Score: 90/100)**  
- Syntactically correct with detailed technical specifications and proper table formatting
- Minor issues include: inconsistent DBU pricing explanation (line 5 mentions mid-tier estimate without context) and some redundant phrasing in effort justifications (lines 25-28)
- All calculations are mathematically sound

**Overall Correctness: 93/100**

## Scoring Summary
