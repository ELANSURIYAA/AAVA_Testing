# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two DB2 to Azure Synapse compatibility reports with significantly different approaches were analyzed. Agent 1 provides comprehensive theoretical analysis including data types not present in queries (DECFLOAT, BLOB, CLOB, GRAPHIC), while Agent 2 focuses specifically on actual SQL content. Agent 1 shows broader migration knowledge but lower accuracy to provided content. Agent 2 demonstrates precise analysis but limited scope. Both are syntactically correct with different structural approaches.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both outputs address DB2 to Azure Synapse compatibility but diverge significantly in scope and focus. Agent 1 provides theoretical migration guidance including data types not present in the actual queries, while Agent 2 analyzes only the provided SQL content. Agent 1 claims 4 incompatible data types (DECFLOAT, BLOB, CLOB, GRAPHIC) that don't exist in the source, while Agent 2 correctly identifies 0 incompatible types from actual content. Both understand migration concepts but apply different analytical boundaries.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 1: Theoretical approach with broader migration scope
- Agent 2: Content-specific analysis with precise accuracy
- Both understand DB2 to Synapse migration fundamentals
- Divergent interpretation of task requirements

### Structural Similarity (Score: 45/100)

Fundamentally different structural approaches. Agent 1 uses formal report structure with numbered sections (1. Compatibility Report, 2. Numerical Breakdown, 3. Detailed Analysis), subsections, and bullet points. Agent 2 employs direct categorical analysis with clear headers (Compatibility Report, Detailed Analysis, Numerical Breakdown, Complete Content Analyzed, Conclusion). Agent 1 follows traditional document hierarchy while Agent 2 uses analytical workflow structure.

**Structural Comparison:**
- Agent 1: Formal numbered sections with hierarchical organization
- Agent 2: Direct categorical headers with workflow-based structure
- Minimal structural overlap despite same domain
- Different information architecture philosophies

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 85/100):**
Syntactically correct but contains factual inaccuracies. Claims 4 incompatible data types (DECFLOAT, BLOB, CLOB, GRAPHIC) and 4 required conversions, but these data types are not present in the provided SQL queries. Overestimates total objects as 18 when actual count is lower. Report structure and formatting are proper, but content accuracy is compromised by analyzing theoretical scenarios rather than actual provided content.

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100):**
Highly accurate and syntactically correct. Correctly identifies 5 data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE) actually present in queries and 0 incompatible types. Provides accurate object counts and includes complete SQL content analysis. Minor deduction for assuming foreign key relationship not explicitly defined in source. Analysis precisely matches provided content with proper technical terminology and formatting.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 90/100):**
Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are well-formatted and syntactically sound, but differ significantly in content accuracy relative to provided source material.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 65 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 45 |
| Correctness | 85 | 95 | 90 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **67** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
Focus analysis on actual provided content rather than theoretical migration scenarios. Verify data type presence before claiming incompatibilities. Reduce scope to match source material for improved accuracy.

**For Agent 2:**
Expand analysis to include broader migration considerations while maintaining current accuracy. Add theoretical guidance for common DB2 to Synapse migration challenges to provide more comprehensive value.

**Overall:**
The comparison reveals a trade-off between comprehensive theoretical knowledge (Agent 1) and precise content-specific analysis (Agent 2). Future implementations should combine Agent 2's accuracy with Agent 1's broader migration expertise for optimal results.
