Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both AAVA and Ascendion_AAVA outputs provide comprehensive test case lists and pytest scripts for Azure Synapse to Fabric dimension table conversion validation. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical business logic and test coverage. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with nearly identical organization and flow. Both outputs are syntactically correct (98/100 average) with minor implementation variations. Overall assessment: 95/100 - highly aligned outputs with equivalent functionality and quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business requirements for dimension table population testing. They cover the same data quality filters: institution_id length validation (lines 15-16 in both), corporation_name TEST prefix exclusion (lines 17-18), and processing_group DEPRECATED/LEGACY filtering (lines 19-20). Test scenarios are semantically equivalent: happy path validation, NULL/short ID handling, boundary testing, and error scenarios. The core intent and business logic understanding are highly aligned with only minor differences in implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs follow identical high-level structure: test case table (lines 1-12) followed by comprehensive pytest script (lines 14+). They use similar organizational patterns: helper functions for table setup, fixture-based test organization, and parametrized testing. Control flow is nearly identical with setup_tables(), teardown logic, and test execution patterns. Minor structural differences include AAVA using more explicit SQLAlchemy constructs while Ascendion_AAVA uses pandas-based simulation, but overall decomposition and logical flow are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,98,Lines 45-50,"AAVA output demonstrates excellent Python syntax correctness. Proper pytest structure with fixtures, parametrization, and exception handling. SQLAlchemy usage is syntactically valid with correct table definitions and query construction. Minor deduction for complex nested logic in populate_dimensions function that could be simplified for better maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA,98,Lines 40-45,"Ascendion_AAVA output shows strong syntactic correctness with valid pandas and SQLAlchemy integration. Proper pytest structure and fixture usage. Clean separation of concerns with run_fabric_merge_logic function. Minor deduction for potential pandas string operation issues with null values in filtering logic that should include null checks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python, pytest, and SQL constructs. No major syntax errors or broken references detected. Both implement proper error handling and test structure. Average correctness score reflects minor implementation details that could be optimized."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,N/A,Lines 100-150,"Consider simplifying the populate_dimensions function by breaking it into separate functions for each dimension table. Add explicit null checks in WHERE clauses for better robustness. Consider adding more detailed logging for test execution tracking."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA,N/A,Lines 80-120,"Add explicit null value handling in pandas string operations to prevent potential errors. Consider adding transaction rollback mechanisms for better test isolation. The pandas-based approach is clean but could benefit from more explicit error handling for edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are production-ready with excellent test coverage and implementation quality. Consider standardizing on either SQLAlchemy-native or pandas-based approach for consistency across team implementations. Both approaches are valid but consistency would improve maintainability."
