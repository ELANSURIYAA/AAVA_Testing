Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-300 (both outputs)","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case frameworks for Azure Synapse to Fabric SQL conversion validation. AAVA_Agent delivers more detailed SQLAlchemy implementation with 10 test cases and robust error handling, while Ascendion_AAVA_Agent provides cleaner Pandas-based approach with similar coverage. Key differences include implementation methodology (SQLAlchemy vs Pandas), error handling sophistication, and code structure organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 15-25, 45-55, 180-200","Both outputs address identical core requirements: dimension table population testing, data quality validation, and edge case handling. They implement the same business logic filters (institution_id length > 3, corporation_name not starting with 'TEST', processing_group exclusions). Minor semantic differences in error handling approaches and test fixture design patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 30-80, 120-180, 250-300","Similar overall structure with test case tables, Pytest implementations, and helper functions. AAVA_Agent uses more granular function decomposition with separate setup/teardown utilities, while Ascendion_AAVA_Agent employs integrated fixture patterns. Both follow standard Pytest conventions but differ in database simulation approaches (SQLAlchemy tables vs Pandas DataFrames)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Agent,92,"Lines 85-95, 150-160, 220-230","Syntactically correct Python code with proper SQLAlchemy usage, valid table definitions, and correct Pytest decorators. Minor issues: potential undefined variable references in lines 150-160 for table cleanup operations, and some inconsistent parameter passing in populate_dimensions function calls."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent,89,"Lines 75-85, 140-150, 200-210","Generally correct Python syntax with proper Pandas operations and SQLAlchemy integration. Issues identified: missing error handling in run_fabric_merge_logic function (lines 75-85), potential DataFrame operation failures without null checks (lines 140-150), and inconsistent exception handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91,"Combined assessment","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor implementation issues that don't affect core functionality. Average correctness score reflects solid Python/SQL knowledge with room for improvement in error handling robustness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Agent,,"Lines 150-160, 220-230","Improve variable scope management in table cleanup operations and standardize parameter passing in populate_dimensions function. Consider adding more explicit type hints and docstrings for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent,,"Lines 75-85, 140-150","Enhance error handling in run_fabric_merge_logic function with try-catch blocks. Add null checks before DataFrame operations to prevent runtime errors. Standardize exception handling patterns across all test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"General improvements","Both implementations would benefit from: 1) Consistent logging frameworks for test execution tracking, 2) Parameterized test configurations for different environments, 3) Integration with CI/CD pipeline validation hooks, 4) Performance benchmarking for large dataset scenarios."
