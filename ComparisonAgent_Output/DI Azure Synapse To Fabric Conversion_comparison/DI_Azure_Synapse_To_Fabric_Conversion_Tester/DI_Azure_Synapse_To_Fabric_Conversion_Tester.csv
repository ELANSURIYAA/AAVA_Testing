Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both AAVA_Output and Ascendion_AAVA_Output provide comprehensive test case specifications and pytest implementations for Azure Synapse to Fabric dimension table conversion validation. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (88/100) with identical business logic and data quality rules, good structural similarity (82/100) with similar overall organization but different implementation approaches, and excellent correctness (95/100 average) with syntactically valid and well-structured code. Key differences include AAVA_Output using more detailed SQLAlchemy operations while Ascendion_AAVA_Output uses pandas-based simulation, and slight variations in test case organization and error handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business requirements for dimension table population testing with the same data quality filters: institution_id length validation (lines 156-158 AAVA vs lines 95-97 Ascendion), corporation_name TEST% exclusion (lines 180-182 AAVA vs lines 105-107 Ascendion), and processing_group DEPRECATED/LEGACY exclusion (lines 204-206 AAVA vs lines 115-117 Ascendion). Both implement upsert logic and comprehensive test coverage including happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios. Minor semantic differences include AAVA_Output providing more detailed API cost tracking and transformation mapping documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case tables and pytest implementations. AAVA_Output uses direct SQLAlchemy operations with explicit upsert logic (lines 140-210), while Ascendion_AAVA_Output uses pandas DataFrames for data manipulation and filtering (lines 80-120). Both use similar fixture patterns (lines 120-130 AAVA vs lines 65-75 Ascendion) and test function organization. Key structural difference is AAVA_Output includes more comprehensive helper functions and detailed table schema definitions (lines 25-85), while Ascendion_AAVA_Output has more streamlined setup with pandas-based logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Output,96,N/A,"AAVA_Output demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with valid Python imports, proper SQLAlchemy table definitions (lines 25-85), correct pytest fixture usage (lines 120-130), and well-formed SQL operations. All variable references are properly defined, table schemas are consistent, and test logic is sound. Minor deduction for some complex nested operations that could benefit from additional error handling in lines 180-210."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Output,94,N/A,"Ascendion_AAVA_Output shows strong syntax correctness with valid pandas operations, proper SQLAlchemy integration (lines 15-45), and correct pytest structure. All imports are valid and variable references are consistent. Minor deduction for potential pandas operation chaining that could raise warnings in lines 85-120 and less explicit error handling in the merge logic simulation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Average correctness score of 95/100. Both outputs demonstrate high-quality, syntactically correct code with proper testing frameworks and logical implementations. No critical syntax errors or broken references identified in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Output,N/A,N/A,"Consider simplifying some of the complex SQLAlchemy operations in lines 180-210 for better maintainability. Add more explicit error handling for edge cases in the upsert logic. The comprehensive documentation and API cost tracking are excellent additions that should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Output,N/A,N/A,"Consider adding more explicit error handling in the pandas-based merge logic simulation (lines 85-120). The streamlined approach is good but could benefit from more detailed schema validation. Consider adding the transformation mapping documentation present in AAVA_Output for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for testing Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion. Consider combining the detailed documentation approach from AAVA_Output with the streamlined pandas implementation from Ascendion_AAVA_Output. Both should add more comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities for production use. The test coverage is excellent in both cases and should be maintained."
