Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both AAVA and Ascendion_AAVA outputs address Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion with comprehensive test cases and Pytest implementations. AAVA provides more detailed transformation analysis and manual intervention guidance, while Ascendion_AAVA focuses on cleaner code structure. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with similar semantic intent but different structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 50-60, 100-110","Both outputs address the same core objective of converting Azure Synapse stored procedures to Fabric SQL with dimension table population. Both identify similar test scenarios (happy path, data quality filters, edge cases, error handling). AAVA provides additional transformation mapping details (LEN() → LENGTH()) and manual intervention recommendations that Ascendion_AAVA lacks. The semantic intent is highly aligned with 85% similarity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-45, 70-95, 120-150","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case list, Pytest implementation, API cost. However, AAVA includes additional sections for transformation change detection and manual interventions. Pytest implementations differ significantly - AAVA uses SQLAlchemy with explicit table definitions and complex upsert logic, while Ascendion_AAVA uses Pandas-based approach with simpler merge operations. Structure similarity is 75% due to different technical implementation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,88,"Lines 25-30, 80-85, 140-145","AAVA's code has minor syntax issues: missing imports for 'text' function (line 25), inconsistent variable unpacking in fixtures (line 80), and potential SQLite dialect incompatibilities with LENGTH() function (line 140). Otherwise, the code structure and logic are sound with proper error handling and comprehensive test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA,92,"Lines 35-40, 90-95","Ascendion_AAVA's code is more syntactically correct with proper Pandas operations and cleaner SQLAlchemy usage. Minor issues include missing error handling in some test cases (line 35) and potential DataFrame operation warnings (line 90). The code follows better Python practices with cleaner separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both outputs having strong technical implementation with minor syntax and best practice issues. Both demonstrate solid understanding of testing frameworks and database operations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,,"1. Add missing import for SQLAlchemy 'text' function. 2. Fix variable unpacking in test fixtures for consistency. 3. Consider SQLite dialect compatibility for LENGTH() vs LEN() functions. 4. Maintain the comprehensive transformation mapping documentation as it adds significant value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA,,"1. Add more robust error handling in edge case tests. 2. Include transformation change detection section similar to AAVA's approach. 3. Add manual intervention recommendations for production deployment. 4. Consider adding more detailed API cost breakdown analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1. Standardized error handling patterns across all test cases. 2. More detailed performance benchmarking for large datasets. 3. Integration with CI/CD pipeline considerations. 4. Documentation of Fabric-specific optimizations and best practices."
