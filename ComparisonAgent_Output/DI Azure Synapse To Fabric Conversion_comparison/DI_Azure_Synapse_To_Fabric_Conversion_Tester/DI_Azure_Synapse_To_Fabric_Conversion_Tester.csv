Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-300 (AAVA), Lines 1-250 (Ascendion_AAVA)","Both agents successfully generated comprehensive test suites for Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion with similar semantic intent (85/100). AAVA provides more detailed transformation mapping and manual interventions while Ascendion_AAVA offers cleaner pandas-based implementation. Structural approaches differ significantly with AAVA using SQLAlchemy ORM vs Ascendion_AAVA using pandas DataFrames (72/100). Both outputs are syntactically correct with minor issues in error handling patterns (88/100 average)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 15-45 (AAVA), Lines 12-35 (Ascendion_AAVA)","Both agents address identical goals: converting Azure Synapse stored procedures to Fabric SQL with comprehensive test coverage. Test case descriptions are semantically equivalent covering happy path, edge cases, data quality filters, and error scenarios. AAVA includes additional transformation change detection (lines 280-295) and manual intervention recommendations (lines 296-300) not present in Ascendion_AAVA. Core business logic alignment is strong with same filtering criteria for institution_id length, TEST% corporation exclusion, and DEPRECATED/LEGACY product group filtering."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 50-250 (AAVA), Lines 40-200 (Ascendion_AAVA)","Fundamental structural differences in implementation approach. AAVA uses SQLAlchemy ORM with Table definitions and explicit SQL operations (lines 60-120), while Ascendion_AAVA uses pandas DataFrames with SQL read/write operations (lines 50-90). Both follow similar test case organization with 10 test cases each, but AAVA implements more complex database setup with metadata reflection while Ascendion_AAVA uses simpler DataFrame operations. Test fixture patterns differ: AAVA uses comprehensive table setup/teardown vs Ascendion_AAVA's lightweight approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,90,"Lines 80-85, 180-185, 220-225","AAVA code is syntactically correct with proper SQLAlchemy usage, valid Python syntax, and correct pytest patterns. Minor issues: line 85 uses text() wrapper unnecessarily for LENGTH function, line 185 has redundant exists check pattern, line 225 parametrized test decorator correctly implemented. All imports are valid and table definitions are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA,86,"Lines 75-80, 160-165, 190-195","Ascendion_AAVA code is mostly syntactically correct with valid pandas operations and pytest structure. Issues identified: line 80 missing null check in pandas filter could cause errors, line 165 exception handling too broad with generic SQLAlchemyError, line 195 boundary test uses string multiplication which may not reflect real-world constraints. DataFrame operations are correctly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,"N/A","Average correctness score of 88/100. Both implementations are functionally sound with minor syntax and logic improvements needed. AAVA shows stronger SQL/database handling while Ascendion_AAVA demonstrates cleaner data manipulation patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,N/A,"Lines 280-300","Leverage AAVA's comprehensive transformation change detection and manual intervention recommendations. The detailed mapping of LEN() to LENGTH() and MERGE to upsert logic provides valuable migration guidance. Consider adopting the explicit error handling patterns and comprehensive table setup approach for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA,N/A,"Lines 50-90, 150-200","Adopt Ascendion_AAVA's cleaner pandas-based approach for data manipulation and testing. The DataFrame operations are more readable and maintainable. Improve error handling specificity and add null checks in filtering operations. The simplified test fixture approach is more efficient for unit testing scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 15-45 (both)","Merge the strengths of both approaches: use AAVA's detailed transformation documentation with Ascendion_AAVA's cleaner implementation patterns. Both test suites provide excellent coverage and should be combined for comprehensive validation. Consider hybrid approach using pandas for data manipulation with SQLAlchemy for database operations."
