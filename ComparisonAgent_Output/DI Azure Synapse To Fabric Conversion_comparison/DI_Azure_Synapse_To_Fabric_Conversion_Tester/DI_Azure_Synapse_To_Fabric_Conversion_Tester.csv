Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementations for Azure Synapse to Fabric SQL conversion. They share identical business logic for dimension table population with same data quality filters (institution_id length > 3, corporation_name not starting with 'TEST', processing_group not 'DEPRECATED'/'LEGACY'). Key differences lie in implementation approach: AAVA uses SQLAlchemy with complex table metadata setup, while Ascendion AAVA uses pandas with simpler dataframe operations. Both achieve the same testing objectives with 10 test cases covering happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios. Overall alignment is strong with minor structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-300,"Both outputs demonstrate nearly identical semantic intent and business understanding. They implement the same dimension table population logic (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) with identical data quality filters. Test case coverage is equivalent covering happy path (TC01), NULL handling (TC02-TC03), data quality exclusions (TC04-TC05), edge cases (TC06-TC08), and error scenarios (TC09-TC10). Business rules are consistently applied: institution_id must be non-NULL and length > 3, corporation_name cannot start with 'TEST', processing_group cannot be 'DEPRECATED' or 'LEGACY'. Minor semantic differences in error handling approach and boundary testing implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,1-300,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case table, pytest script, cost estimation. However, implementation approaches differ significantly. AAVA uses SQLAlchemy with MetaData, Table objects, and complex engine management (lines 25-85), while Ascendion AAVA uses pandas DataFrames with simpler to_sql operations (lines 80-120). Test organization varies: AAVA implements helper functions for table setup/teardown and uses more sophisticated database simulation, Ascendion AAVA uses fixture-based approach with pandas operations. Both use pytest.mark.parametrize for similar test cases but with different underlying execution logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,88,Various,"AAVA output has strong syntactic correctness with proper SQLAlchemy usage, valid Python syntax, and well-structured pytest implementation. Minor issues: line 45 has undefined variable reference in error test case, line 180 uses deprecated fetchall().__len__() instead of len(fetchall()). Import statements are complete and correct. Table schema definitions are properly structured with appropriate column types and constraints."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AAVA,85,Various,"Ascendion AAVA output demonstrates good syntactic correctness with valid pandas operations and pytest structure. Minor issues: line 95 potential KeyError handling could be more specific, line 140 missing proper exception type specification in test_missing_columns. Some boundary value tests (line 200+) may cause memory issues with very long strings. Overall structure is sound with proper import statements and fixture usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,87,N/A,"Average correctness score across both outputs. Both demonstrate strong technical implementation with minor syntactic issues that don't affect core functionality. AAVA shows slightly better error handling and SQLAlchemy best practices, while Ascendion AAVA has simpler but effective pandas-based approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,N/A,Lines 45-180,"Fix undefined variable reference in error test case (line 45). Replace deprecated fetchall().__len__() with len(fetchall()) pattern (line 180). Consider adding more explicit error messages in assertion statements for better test debugging."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AAVA,N/A,Lines 95-200,"Improve exception handling specificity in test_missing_columns (line 140). Add memory optimization for boundary value tests with very long strings (line 200+). Consider adding transaction rollback handling for failed test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized error handling patterns across all test cases, 2) Addition of performance benchmarking for large dataset scenarios, 3) Integration with actual Fabric SQL environment for end-to-end validation, 4) Documentation of expected execution time for each test case, 5) Addition of data lineage validation tests to ensure transformation correctness."
