# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for converting Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Microsoft Fabric SQL. Agent1_Output focuses on conversion accuracy and optimization with API cost of 0.0087 USD. Agent2_Output provides similar coverage with enhanced detail on test automation and end-to-end validation, with API cost of 0.0134 USD. Both maintain technical accuracy and completeness.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address the identical core objective: documenting the conversion of populate_dimensions stored procedure from Synapse to Fabric SQL. Key semantic alignments include:

1. Both describe the same three dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT)
2. Both reference STG_DIMENSION_DATA as source
3. Both emphasize idempotent upsert operations via MERGE statements  
4. Both detail identical data quality filters

Minor semantic differences: Agent2_Output provides more emphasis on test automation and end-to-end validation processes (lines 25-35).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow similar structural organization with:
1. Header with author/description
2. Summary section
3. Conversion Accuracy section
4. Optimization Suggestions section
5. API Cost Estimation

Structural differences: Agent1_Output uses bullet-point organization throughout, while Agent2_Output mixes bullet points with paragraph format (lines 10-20, 30-45). Agent2_Output includes additional subsections for test coverage and end-to-end automation that Agent1_Output covers more briefly.

### Correctness

**Agent1_Output (Score: 95/100)**
Syntactically well-formed documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues:
- Line 8: missing space in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a formatting artifact
- All technical references are accurate and properly formatted
- SQL syntax references are correct
- Cost estimation format is proper

**Agent2_Output (Score: 93/100)**  
Well-structured documentation with proper formatting. Minor issues:
- Line 6: spacing inconsistency in author field 'Ascendion  AAVA' (double space)
- Line 15: 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be a formatting artifact
- All technical content is syntactically correct
- References to test frameworks and automation are properly formatted

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**
