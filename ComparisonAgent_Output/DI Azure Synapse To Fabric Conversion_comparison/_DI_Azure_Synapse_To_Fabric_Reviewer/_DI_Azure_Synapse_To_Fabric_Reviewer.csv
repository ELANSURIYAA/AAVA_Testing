Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for converting Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Microsoft Fabric SQL. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical business logic and requirements coverage. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) with consistent organization and flow. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and internal consistency. The outputs effectively address conversion accuracy, optimization opportunities, and cost estimation with minor variations in presentation style and detail emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: converting Synapse stored procedure to Fabric SQL for dimension table population. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Same business logic for DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT tables (lines 8-15 in both), (2) Identical data quality filters and exclusion rules (lines 16-20), (3) Same idempotent upsert approach using MERGE operations (lines 21-25), (4) Consistent optimization recommendations for partitioning and performance (lines 35-45). Minor semantic differences: Output 1 emphasizes 'idempotent upsert logic' while Output 2 focuses on 'transactional semantics' - same concept, different terminology. Score reduced by 5 points due to slight emphasis variations in technical approach description."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) Header with author and description (lines 1-5), (2) Summary section providing overview (lines 6-10), (3) Conversion Accuracy section with detailed technical analysis (lines 11-30), (4) Optimization Suggestions with actionable recommendations (lines 31-45), (5) API Cost Estimation (lines 46-50). Structural differences: Output 1 uses bullet points more extensively, Output 2 uses more paragraph-based formatting. Output 2 includes additional subsection on end-to-end automation (lines 25-28) not present in Output 1. Flow and logical progression are consistent across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Output1,100,1-50,"Output 1 demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness: (1) Proper document formatting with consistent header structure, (2) Valid bullet point syntax and indentation, (3) Correct technical terminology and references, (4) No broken internal references or inconsistencies, (5) Proper section organization and flow, (6) Accurate technical details about Synapse to Fabric conversion, (7) Valid cost estimation format and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Output2,100,1-50,"Output 2 demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness: (1) Proper document formatting with consistent header structure, (2) Valid paragraph and section organization, (3) Correct technical terminology and references, (4) No broken internal references or inconsistencies, (5) Proper section organization and flow, (6) Accurate technical details about conversion process, (7) Valid cost estimation format with detailed breakdown, (8) Consistent use of technical terms and concepts throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs achieve perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Output1,,"Output 1 provides solid technical documentation but could benefit from: (1) Adding more detailed subsections like end-to-end automation coverage found in Output 2, (2) Expanding on specific Fabric SQL dialect differences, (3) Including more granular cost breakdown components, (4) Adding validation methodology details for comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Output2,,"Output 2 demonstrates comprehensive coverage but could improve by: (1) Adopting more structured bullet-point formatting for better readability, (2) Consolidating some verbose paragraphs for clearer technical communication, (3) Ensuring consistent terminology usage (e.g., standardizing on either 'idempotent' or 'transactional' approach), (4) Adding more specific line-by-line code comparison examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Including actual code snippets for before/after comparison, (2) Adding specific performance benchmarks or metrics, (3) Providing more detailed error handling examples, (4) Including validation scripts or test case examples, (5) Adding specific Fabric SQL syntax differences documentation, (6) Incorporating change management and deployment considerations for enterprise environments."
