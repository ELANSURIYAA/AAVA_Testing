Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs are comprehensive technical documentation for converting Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Microsoft Fabric SQL. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical core objectives and technical approaches. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with nearly identical section organization and flow. Both documents are syntactically correct and well-formed (100/100 each). The outputs effectively address the same conversion requirements with minor variations in detail emphasis and cost estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 5-15,"Both outputs address the identical conversion task with the same technical objectives. Core concepts are aligned: dimension table population (DIM_INSTITUTION DIM_CORPORATION DIM_PRODUCT) data quality filters idempotent MERGE operations and Delta Lake optimization. Minor semantic differences include Agent 1 focusing more on test coverage details (lines 25-30) while Agent 2 emphasizes end-to-end automation (lines 35-40). API cost estimates differ slightly (0.0087 vs 0.0134 USD) but both provide reasonable cost projections."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-50,"Structural organization is nearly identical across both outputs. Both follow the same logical flow: Header with metadata Summary section Conversion Accuracy analysis Optimization Suggestions and API Cost Estimation. Section ordering and decomposition approach are consistent. Minor structural differences include Agent 1 using bullet points for accuracy items (lines 10-20) while Agent 2 uses paragraph format for some sections (lines 15-25). Overall document architecture and information hierarchy are well-aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-50,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct and well-formed. All internal references are consistent technical terminology is accurate and document structure is logical. No syntax errors broken references or formatting issues detected. Header metadata is properly formatted section transitions are smooth and all technical details are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-50,"Agent 2 output is syntactically correct and well-formed. Document structure is logical with proper section organization. All technical references are accurate and consistent. No syntax errors formatting issues or broken internal references detected. Header information is complete and all sections flow logically with appropriate technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness and internal consistency. Average correctness score is 100/100 with no syntax errors or structural issues in either document."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 30-45,"Agent 1 provides comprehensive optimization suggestions including partitioning clustering batch processing and monitoring. The test coverage emphasis is valuable for ensuring conversion accuracy. Consider expanding the API cost breakdown to include more granular cost components as shown in Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 35-50,"Agent 2 offers detailed optimization recommendations with strong focus on end-to-end validation and automation. The comprehensive cost estimation including breakdown components is valuable. Consider adding more specific test coverage details as provided in Agent 1 to strengthen validation approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide high-quality technical documentation for the Synapse to Fabric conversion. Recommend combining the detailed test coverage approach from Agent 1 with the comprehensive cost breakdown from Agent 2 for optimal documentation. Both agents successfully preserve all critical conversion requirements while providing actionable optimization guidance."
