Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Azure Synapse to Microsoft Fabric SQL conversion for dimension table population. Output 1 focuses on technical accuracy and testing coverage with API cost of 0.0087 USD. Output 2 emphasizes business logic preservation and end-to-end validation with API cost of 0.0134 USD. Both cover identical core functionality: populating DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, and DIM_PRODUCT tables from STG_DIMENSION_DATA with proper data quality filters and idempotent MERGE operations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: converting Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Fabric SQL with Delta Lake operations. Key semantic alignments: (1) Same three dimension tables and staging source, (2) Identical data quality filters for each table, (3) Same emphasis on idempotent MERGE operations, (4) Similar optimization recommendations. Minor semantic differences: Output 1 emphasizes test coverage more heavily (lines 20-25), while Output 2 focuses more on business logic preservation and end-to-end validation (lines 15-20). Both conclude with similar API cost estimations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Summary -> Conversion Accuracy -> Optimization Suggestions -> API Cost Estimation. Structural alignments: (1) Same section headers and logical flow, (2) Similar bullet-point organization within sections, (3) Consistent technical detail depth. Structural differences: Output 1 includes explicit 'Test coverage' subsection (lines 22-25), Output 2 integrates testing discussion within main sections. Output 2 includes additional concluding paragraph (lines 45-50) that Output 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,98,1-30,"Output 1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness: proper formatting, consistent terminology, accurate technical references. All SQL constructs mentioned are valid (MERGE INTO, WHEN NOT MATCHED, DISTINCT). Data quality filter descriptions are technically accurate. Minor issue: line 28 references 'max field lengths' in testing without specifying actual limits."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,97,1-50,"Output 2 shows strong syntactic correctness with proper technical documentation structure. All references to Synapse and Fabric SQL features are accurate. Business logic descriptions are consistent and well-formed. Minor issues: line 35 mentions 'string functions (e.g., LEN to LENGTH)' conversion that may not be universally applicable, and line 48 has a formatting inconsistency in the cost breakdown section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper technical documentation standards. Average score reflects minor technical specification issues in both outputs but overall excellent quality and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,1-30,"Strengthen optimization recommendations by providing more specific implementation details for partitioning and clustering strategies. Consider adding explicit error handling examples beyond test coverage mentions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,1-50,"Improve technical precision in optimization suggestions, particularly around string function conversions and Delta Lake tuning parameters. Consider consolidating the concluding section for better structural consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) More specific cost breakdown methodologies, (2) Explicit performance benchmarking criteria, (3) Clearer migration timeline recommendations, (4) Enhanced error handling implementation examples beyond theoretical discussion."
