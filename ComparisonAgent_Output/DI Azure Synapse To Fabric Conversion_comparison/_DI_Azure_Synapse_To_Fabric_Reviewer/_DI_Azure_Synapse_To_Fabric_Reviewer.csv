Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of converting Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Microsoft Fabric SQL. Output 1 focuses on conversion accuracy validation and optimization suggestions with detailed test coverage analysis. Output 2 emphasizes business logic preservation and end-to-end automation validation. Both maintain the same core technical requirements: idempotent upsert operations for three dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) from STG_DIMENSION_DATA staging table, with identical data quality filters and Delta Lake optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address the identical conversion goal with highly aligned intent. Core business logic, data quality filters, and technical requirements are semantically equivalent. Minor divergence in emphasis: Output 1 focuses more on test coverage details while Output 2 emphasizes end-to-end validation automation. Both correctly identify the same three dimension tables, staging source, and data quality rules."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-50 vs 1-60,"Both follow similar document structure with header, summary, conversion accuracy, and optimization sections. Output 1 uses bullet-point organization under major headings. Output 2 uses more narrative flow with embedded technical details. Key structural difference: Output 1 has explicit 'Test coverage' subsection while Output 2 integrates testing discussion throughout. Both conclude with API cost estimation but different values (0.0087 vs 0.0134 USD)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,95,Lines 15-20,"Well-formed document structure with consistent formatting. Minor issue: some bullet points could be better aligned. All technical details are syntactically correct and internally consistent. References to tables, procedures, and technical concepts are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,93,Lines 25-30,"Generally well-structured with good narrative flow. Minor formatting inconsistency in the summary section spacing. All technical references and SQL concepts are correctly presented. Cost breakdown section is more detailed than Output 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper document structure, consistent technical terminology, and accurate references. Minor formatting variations do not impact overall quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,N/A,Lines 35-45,"Strengthen structural consistency by standardizing bullet point formatting and section organization. Consider adding more detailed cost breakdown similar to Output 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Improve document formatting consistency, particularly in summary section spacing. Consider adopting Output 1's clear subsection organization for test coverage details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs successfully capture the conversion requirements and provide valuable technical insights. Consider standardizing the cost estimation methodology and format for consistency across similar conversion projects. Both would benefit from explicit version control and change tracking sections."
