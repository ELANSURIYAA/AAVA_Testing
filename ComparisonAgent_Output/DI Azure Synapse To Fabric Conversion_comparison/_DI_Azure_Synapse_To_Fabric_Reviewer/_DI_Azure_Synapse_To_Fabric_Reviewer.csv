Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for converting Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions' to Microsoft Fabric SQL. Agent1_Output focuses on conversion accuracy and optimization with API cost of 0.0087 USD. Agent2_Output provides similar coverage with enhanced detail on test automation and end-to-end validation, with API cost of 0.0134 USD. Both maintain technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 5-15, 25-35","Both outputs address the identical core objective: documenting the conversion of populate_dimensions stored procedure from Synapse to Fabric SQL. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both describe the same three dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT), (2) Both reference STG_DIMENSION_DATA as source, (3) Both emphasize idempotent upsert operations via MERGE statements, (4) Both detail identical data quality filters. Minor semantic differences: Agent2_Output provides more emphasis on test automation and end-to-end validation processes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 10-20, 30-45","Both outputs follow similar structural organization with: (1) Header with author/description, (2) Summary section, (3) Conversion Accuracy section, (4) Optimization Suggestions section, (5) API Cost Estimation. Structural differences: Agent1_Output uses bullet-point organization throughout, while Agent2_Output mixes bullet points with paragraph format. Agent2_Output includes additional subsections for test coverage and end-to-end automation that Agent1_Output covers more briefly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Output,95,"Lines 8-12, 20-25","Syntactically well-formed documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: (1) Line 8 - missing space in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a formatting artifact, (2) All technical references are accurate and properly formatted, (3) SQL syntax references are correct, (4) Cost estimation format is proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Output,93,"Lines 6-10, 15-20","Well-structured documentation with proper formatting. Minor issues: (1) Line 6 - spacing inconsistency in author field 'Ascendion  AAVA' (double space), (2) Line 15 - 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be a formatting artifact, (3) All technical content is syntactically correct, (4) References to test frameworks and automation are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 93) / 2 = 94. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with only minor formatting artifacts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Output,,"Lines 25-35","Strengthen the output by: (1) Adding more detail on test automation coverage as shown in Agent2_Output, (2) Expanding on end-to-end validation processes, (3) Including more specific guidance on Fabric notebook integration for error handling."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Output,,"Lines 35-45","Enhance the output by: (1) Condensing some redundant explanations for better readability, (2) Aligning bullet-point formatting consistency with Agent1_Output style, (3) Consider reducing API cost through optimization strategies mentioned."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Standardizing formatting artifacts and spacing issues, (2) Cross-referencing each other's strengths - Agent1_Output's concise organization with Agent2_Output's comprehensive test coverage, (3) Providing more specific line-by-line code examples for the conversion differences mentioned."
