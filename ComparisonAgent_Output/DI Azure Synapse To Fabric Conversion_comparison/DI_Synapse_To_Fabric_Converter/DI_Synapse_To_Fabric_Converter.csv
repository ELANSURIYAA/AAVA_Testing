Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs successfully convert Azure Synapse stored procedure logic to Microsoft Fabric SQL with nearly identical semantic intent and structural approach. Key difference: Generic_Fabric_Converter uses correct LENGTH() function while Lakehouse_Fabric_Converter uses SQL Server LEN() syntax. Lakehouse version includes explicit schema prefixes for better organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"","Both outputs address identical business requirements for dimension table population with same data quality filters, MERGE operations, and business logic. Minor semantic difference in function choice (LENGTH vs LEN) but overall intent is virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"","Nearly identical structural approach with three main sections, same MERGE statement patterns, identical column selections and filtering logic. Only difference is schema prefixing in lakehouse version."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Generic_Fabric_Converter,100,"","Perfect syntax for Microsoft Fabric SQL including correct use of LENGTH() function, proper MERGE syntax, and valid SQL structure throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Lakehouse_Fabric_Converter,95,"Line 19","Uses LEN() function which is SQL Server syntax rather than Fabric SQL LENGTH() function. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper schema prefixes."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,"","Average of both agents' correctness scores. Minor syntax issue in lakehouse version prevents perfect score."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Lakehouse_Fabric_Converter,,"Line 19","Replace LEN() with LENGTH() function for proper Fabric SQL compatibility"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Generic_Fabric_Converter,,"","Consider adding explicit schema prefixes like lakehouse version for better organization and clarity"
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both outputs are production-ready with minor enhancements suggested. Lakehouse version provides better schema organization while generic version has better Fabric SQL syntax compliance"
