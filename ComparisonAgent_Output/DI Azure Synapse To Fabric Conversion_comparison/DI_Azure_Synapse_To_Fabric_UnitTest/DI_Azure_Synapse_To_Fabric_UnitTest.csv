Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs are comprehensive pytest test suites for validating Fabric SQL dimension table population logic. They share identical test case coverage (10 test cases each) and similar structural approaches using SQLAlchemy for database simulation. Key differences include Agent 1's more robust error handling with specific exception types, more detailed table schema definitions with explicit constraints, and more comprehensive upsert logic simulation. Agent 2 uses pandas for data manipulation which simplifies some operations but may not accurately reflect actual SQL behavior. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the testing requirements with proper edge case coverage and data quality validation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs address identical testing objectives for dimension table population with the same 10 test case categories: happy path (TC01), upsert logic (TC02), data quality filters for institution_id length (TC03), corporation_name TEST prefix exclusion (TC04), processing_group exclusion (TC05), empty staging (TC06), null data handling (TC07), missing columns (TC08), invalid data types (TC09), and boundary values (TC10). The semantic intent and business logic validation are nearly identical, with both implementing the same data quality rules and upsert behavior. Minor semantic differences exist in error handling approaches and data manipulation methods."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,All,"Both outputs follow similar pytest structure with fixtures for database setup/teardown, helper functions for data manipulation, and parameterized tests. Agent 1 uses more explicit SQLAlchemy table definitions with primary key constraints (lines 25-27, 35-37, 49-51) and implements upsert logic with explicit existence checks (lines 85-95, 105-115, 125-135). Agent 2 uses pandas DataFrames for data manipulation (lines 85-95) which simplifies the merge logic but differs structurally from SQL operations. Both use similar test function naming and organization, but Agent 1 has more detailed schema setup while Agent 2 has more streamlined data processing logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,All,"Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper imports, valid SQLAlchemy table definitions, and correct pytest syntax. All function definitions are syntactically valid with proper exception handling using specific exception types (ProgrammingError line 185, DataError line 194). Table schema definitions include proper constraints and data types. The upsert logic implementation is syntactically correct with proper SQL query construction and transaction handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,88,Lines 85-95,"Agent 2 has generally correct syntax but contains some potential issues. The pandas-based merge logic (lines 85-95) may not accurately simulate SQL behavior, particularly for the string length check 'stg_df['institution_id'].str.len() > 3' which could fail on null values. The error handling in test_missing_columns (line 165) and test_invalid_data_types (line 195) uses generic exception types that may not catch the specific errors intended. Some DataFrame operations may not handle edge cases as robustly as SQL equivalents."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,All,"Overall correctness is high with both outputs demonstrating solid pytest and SQLAlchemy usage. Agent 1 shows superior error handling specificity and more accurate SQL simulation, while Agent 2 has some potential runtime issues with pandas operations on null data and less specific exception handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 85-135,"Agent 1 provides excellent foundation with robust error handling and accurate SQL simulation. Consider adding more comprehensive logging and test data validation. The explicit upsert logic with existence checks closely mirrors actual SQL behavior, making it highly reliable for validation purposes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,88,Lines 85-95,"Agent 2 should address potential null value handling issues in pandas operations, particularly the string length check on institution_id. Consider using more specific exception types in error handling tests and validate that pandas merge logic accurately represents SQL upsert behavior. The simplified approach is elegant but may miss edge cases that would occur in actual SQL execution."
