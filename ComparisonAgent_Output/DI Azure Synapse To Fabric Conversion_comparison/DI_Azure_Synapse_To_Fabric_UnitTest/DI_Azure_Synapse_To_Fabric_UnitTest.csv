Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive unit test suites for dimension table population logic with similar test coverage and structure. Ascendion_AAVA_Fabric_SQL focuses on direct Fabric SQL simulation while Ascendion_AAVA_Azure_Synapse_Fabric emphasizes Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion. Key differences include implementation approach (SQLAlchemy vs Pandas), error handling strategies, and specific test logic details. Both achieve strong semantic alignment (85/100) with good structural similarity (88/100) and high correctness scores (92/100 and 89/100 respectively)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address the same fundamental goal of testing dimension table population with comprehensive coverage of happy path, data quality filters, edge cases, and error scenarios. Core test scenarios are semantically equivalent: institution_id validation (NULL/short), corporation_name TEST prefix filtering, processing_group DEPRECATED/LEGACY exclusion, duplicate handling, and boundary testing. Minor semantic differences exist in error handling approaches and specific implementation details, but overall intent and coverage remain highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural patterns: tabular test case list followed by pytest implementation with fixtures and individual test functions. Test case organization, naming conventions (TC01-TC10), and logical flow are highly consistent. Key structural differences include: Ascendion_AAVA_Fabric_SQL uses more granular SQLAlchemy-based table operations (lines 45-85), while Ascendion_AAVA_Azure_Synapse_Fabric employs Pandas DataFrame operations (lines 95-125). Both maintain consistent fixture patterns and test function structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Fabric_SQL,92,"Lines 15-20, 45-50, 180-185","High syntactic correctness with valid Python imports, proper SQLAlchemy usage, and well-formed pytest fixtures. Minor issues: potential undefined variable in line 180 where 'text' function usage could be clearer, and some complex nested operations in lines 45-50 that could benefit from better error handling. Overall structure is sound with proper exception handling and parameterized tests."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Azure_Synapse_Fabric,89,"Lines 25-30, 95-100, 200-205","Good syntactic correctness with proper pandas and SQLAlchemy imports. Issues identified: potential KeyError handling weakness in lines 95-100 where column access could fail silently, missing error handling for DataFrame operations in lines 200-205, and some inconsistent string operations that could cause runtime errors. Test structure is well-formed with appropriate fixtures and assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91,All,"Average correctness score reflecting both implementations' strong syntactic foundation with minor areas for improvement in error handling and edge case management. Both outputs demonstrate solid understanding of pytest patterns and database testing methodologies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Fabric_SQL,95,"Lines 45-50, 180-185","Strengthen error handling in complex SQLAlchemy operations and clarify text function usage for better maintainability. Consider adding more explicit transaction management in test fixtures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Azure_Synapse_Fabric,93,"Lines 95-100, 200-205","Enhance DataFrame operation error handling and add explicit column existence validation before access. Improve string operation consistency to prevent runtime errors. Consider adding more robust data type validation in test setup."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,94,All,"Both implementations would benefit from: 1) More comprehensive logging for test debugging, 2) Additional performance testing for large datasets, 3) Enhanced documentation for complex test scenarios, 4) Standardized error message formats across test cases, 5) Integration with CI/CD pipeline considerations for automated testing."
