Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive unit test suites for validating dimension table population logic from staging data. Output 1 uses SQLAlchemy with in-memory SQLite and implements SQL-like logic in Python, while Output 2 uses Pandas DataFrames with SQLAlchemy for a more data-centric approach. Both cover the same test scenarios but with different implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 30-40","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing dimension table population with data quality filters. They cover identical test scenarios (TC01-TC10) including happy path, edge cases, and error conditions. The main semantic difference is in implementation approach: Output 1 simulates actual SQL operations while Output 2 uses DataFrame operations. Both apply the same business rules for data filtering."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 50-100, 150-200, 250-300","Both outputs follow similar overall structure with test case tables and pytest implementations. However, Output 1 uses more SQL-centric approach with table creation, CTE-like operations, and explicit upsert logic (lines 80-120), while Output 2 uses DataFrame operations and pandas merge logic (lines 90-130). The test case organization and fixture patterns are similar but implementation details differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Output1,92,"Lines 45-50, 120-125, 200-205","Output 1 has mostly correct syntax with proper SQLAlchemy usage, table definitions, and test implementations. Minor issues include potential string length validation logic on line 85 using text() function which may not work consistently across all SQL dialects. The upsert logic is correctly implemented with explicit existence checks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Output2,88,"Lines 60-65, 140-145, 220-225","Output 2 has correct pandas and SQLAlchemy syntax overall. However, there are some issues with the filtering logic on line 95 where string operations may fail on NaN values, and the error handling test cases (TC06, TC09) use generic exception catching which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with proper test structure, fixtures, and assertions. Minor syntax and logic issues prevent perfect scores but both would function as intended with minimal adjustments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Output1,,"Consider adding more robust error handling for SQL dialect differences, particularly around the LENGTH() function usage. Add explicit transaction rollback mechanisms for failed test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Output2,,"Improve NaN handling in string operations for data filtering. Replace generic exception catching with more specific exception types in error test cases. Consider adding explicit data type validation before DataFrame operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Adding performance benchmarking for large datasets, 2) Including integration tests with actual Fabric SQL environment, 3) Adding data lineage validation tests, 4) Implementing parameterized tests for boundary value testing with more comprehensive edge cases."
