Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pytest test suites for validating dimension table population logic, with Agent1 focusing on SQLAlchemy-based simulation of Fabric SQL operations and Agent2 emphasizing pandas-based Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion testing. Both cover similar test scenarios including data quality filters, upsert logic, and edge cases, though with different implementation approaches and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 1-45","Both outputs address the same core testing objective of validating dimension table population (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) with data quality filters. Agent1 provides more comprehensive error handling scenarios (TC08-TC09) and boundary testing (TC10), while Agent2 focuses more on the specific Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion context. Both cover similar business rules: NULL/short institution_id filtering, TEST% corporation_name exclusion, and DEPRECATED/LEGACY processing_group filtering. The semantic alignment is strong but not perfect due to different technical emphases."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 51-200, 46-180","Both follow standard pytest structure with fixtures, parameterized tests, and helper functions. Agent1 uses more sophisticated SQLAlchemy table definitions with proper metadata and column specifications (lines 51-100), while Agent2 uses simpler pandas-based approach with DataFrame operations (lines 46-80). Agent1 implements actual upsert logic simulation, while Agent2 uses pandas merge operations. Both use similar test case organization but different underlying data manipulation approaches. The structural similarity is moderate due to different technical implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent1,95,"Lines 51-350","Agent1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper SQLAlchemy usage, well-defined table schemas, appropriate exception handling with pytest.raises, and consistent variable naming. The code includes proper connection management, transaction handling, and comprehensive fixture setup/teardown. Minor deduction for potential complexity in the populate_dimensions function that could be refactored for better maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent2,90,"Lines 46-280","Agent2 shows good syntax correctness with proper pandas operations, SQLAlchemy integration, and pytest structure. However, there are some concerns: potential data type handling issues in test_invalid_data_types (line 250-260), inconsistent error handling approaches, and the run_fabric_merge_logic function could benefit from better error handling for missing columns. The code is functional but has some robustness gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntax correctness and internal consistency. Agent1 shows slightly better error handling and code robustness, while Agent2 provides a more streamlined but potentially less robust implementation. Both are syntactically valid and would execute successfully in their respective environments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent1,,"Consider simplifying the populate_dimensions function by breaking it into smaller, more focused functions for each dimension table. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging purposes. Consider adding performance benchmarking tests for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent2,,"Improve error handling in the run_fabric_merge_logic function, particularly for missing columns and data type mismatches. Add more robust data validation before DataFrame operations. Consider adding transaction rollback mechanisms for failed operations. Enhance the test_invalid_data_types test case to handle edge cases more gracefully."
