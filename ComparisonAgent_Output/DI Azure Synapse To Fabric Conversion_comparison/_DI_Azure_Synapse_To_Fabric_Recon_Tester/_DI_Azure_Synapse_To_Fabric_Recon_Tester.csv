Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produce comprehensive Azure Synapse to Fabric migration scripts with end-to-end automation capabilities. Agent 1 provides more detailed error handling and function decomposition with 10 numbered sections, while Agent 2 offers a more streamlined approach. Key difference: Agent 1 contains a critical syntax error with undefined variable usage, while Agent 2 maintains syntactic correctness throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both scripts address identical core objectives: Synapse SQL execution, ADLS export, Fabric setup, and validation. They implement similar authentication patterns, data comparison logic, and cost tracking. Minor semantic differences in configuration structure (Agent 1 uses nested CONFIG dict, Agent 2 uses flatter structure) and API interaction patterns (Agent 1 uses direct pyodbc, Agent 2 includes REST API approaches)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both follow similar 10-section numbered structure with imports, configuration, authentication, execution phases, and cleanup. Agent 1 provides more granular function decomposition (15+ functions vs 12 functions in Agent 2). Control flow is nearly identical with main orchestration calling sequential steps. Agent 2 consolidates some operations that Agent 1 separates into distinct functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,75,82,"Syntax error on line 82: undefined variable used as both variable name and attribute access without proper definition. This would cause NameError at runtime. All other syntax appears valid with proper imports, function definitions, and control structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,N/A,"Syntactically correct throughout with proper variable definitions, function calls, and control structures. Minor issue: some placeholder API calls that would need actual implementation, but syntax is valid. All imports are properly structured and function signatures are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,N/A,"Average of Agent 1 (75) and Agent 2 (95). Agent 1's syntax error significantly impacts correctness score despite otherwise solid implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,82,"Fix critical syntax error on line 82 by properly defining the credential variable before use. Consider implementing the placeholder Fabric API calls with actual REST endpoints. Enhance error handling in ADLS upload validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Implement actual Fabric API endpoints to replace placeholder calls. Consider adding more granular error handling similar to Agent 1's approach. Add validation for configuration completeness before execution."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Comprehensive unit test coverage, 2) Configuration validation at startup, 3) Retry logic for API calls, 4) More detailed logging throughout execution phases, 5) Schema validation for data consistency checks."
