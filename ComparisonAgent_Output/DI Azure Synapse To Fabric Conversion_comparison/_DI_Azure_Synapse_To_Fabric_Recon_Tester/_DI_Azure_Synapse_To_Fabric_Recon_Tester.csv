Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive Azure Synapse to Fabric migration scripts with authentication, data export, ADLS transfer, and validation capabilities. Agent_1_Migration_Script offers a more generic approach while Agent_2_Dimension_Script focuses specifically on dimension table migration. Critical syntax error in Agent_1 significantly impacts correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"","Both scripts address the same core migration goal with similar authentication patterns, data export workflows, and validation logic. Agent_1 provides more comprehensive error handling and generic table processing, while Agent_2 focuses specifically on dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT). Both include cost estimation and cleanup procedures. Minor differences in API approaches and configuration management."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"","Both follow nearly identical 10-section structure: imports, configuration, authentication, Synapse execution, data export, ADLS transfer, Fabric setup, Fabric execution, comparison logic, and cleanup. Flow patterns are consistent with main orchestration functions. Agent_1 uses more modular function decomposition while Agent_2 has more integrated approach in main() function."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Migration_Script,25,"Line 71","Critical syntax error: undefined variable '[TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER]' used as both variable name and method call. Line 71 contains token placeholder that wasn't properly replaced with actual variable name. Otherwise, syntax is generally correct with proper imports and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Dimension_Script,92,"","Clean syntax throughout with proper variable declarations, imports, and function definitions. Minor issues: Line 95 has a potential issue with sample() on empty DataFrames, and Line 145 merge logic could fail with mismatched schemas. Overall well-structured with proper error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,59,"","Average of Agent_1 (25) and Agent_2 (92). Agent_1's critical syntax error significantly impacts overall correctness despite otherwise sound structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Migration_Script,,"Line 71","CRITICAL: Fix undefined variable token placeholder on line 71. Replace with proper token variable name like 'access_token'. Add error handling for authentication failures. Consider adding more specific exception handling in upload_to_adls() function."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Dimension_Script,,"Lines 95, 145","Add validation for empty DataFrames before calling sample() method (line 95). Enhance merge logic error handling for schema mismatches (line 145). Consider adding retry logic for API calls. Overall structure is solid and production-ready."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both scripts would benefit from: 1) More comprehensive logging, 2) Configuration validation at startup, 3) Async processing for large datasets, 4) More granular cost tracking, 5) Integration with monitoring systems. Agent_2 demonstrates better coding practices and should be used as the reference implementation after addressing minor issues."
