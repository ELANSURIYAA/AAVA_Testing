Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both scripts implement end-to-end automation for Azure Synapse to Microsoft Fabric migration with validation. Script1 provides a more generic approach while Script2 focuses on specific dimension tables. Key difference: Script1 contains a critical syntax error with an embedded authentication token on line 69, while Script2 is syntactically correct. Both follow similar 10-section architectural patterns with comparable functionality for authentication, data export, ADLS transfer, and table comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 50-80, 200-250","Both scripts address the same core migration and validation task with similar transformations and reasoning. Script1 is more generic handling any tables while Script2 specifically targets dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT). Both implement identical cost tracking, authentication patterns, and comparison logic. Minor divergence in table handling approach and configuration structure."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 300-350","Nearly identical 10-section structure: imports, configuration, authentication, Synapse execution, data export, ADLS transfer, Fabric setup, Fabric execution, comparison logic, cleanup. Both use similar function decomposition, control flow patterns, and main orchestration approach. Minor differences in function naming and parameter handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script1,25,"Line 69","Critical syntax error: undefined variable containing authentication token accidentally embedded in code. This would cause NameError at runtime. Also has potential issues with undefined token references in authentication function."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script2,95,"Lines 1-200","Syntactically correct Python code with proper variable definitions, imports, and function structures. Minor deduction for some placeholder comments indicating incomplete REST API implementations, but core syntax is valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,60,,"Average of Script1 (25) and Script2 (95). Script1's critical syntax error significantly impacts overall correctness despite Script2's high quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Script1,,"Fix critical syntax error on line 69 by removing embedded authentication token and properly defining authentication variables. Review all token references for security compliance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Script2,,"Complete REST API placeholder implementations for production readiness. Consider adding more robust error handling for API calls."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Standardize configuration parameter names between scripts. Consider merging approaches - Script2's dimension-specific focus with Script1's generic table handling capability."
