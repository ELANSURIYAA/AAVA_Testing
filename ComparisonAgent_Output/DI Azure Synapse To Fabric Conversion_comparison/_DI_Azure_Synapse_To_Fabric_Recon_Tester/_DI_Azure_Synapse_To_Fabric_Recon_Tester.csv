Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are comprehensive Python automation scripts for Synapse-to-Fabric migration with validation. Output 1 provides more extensive error handling, authentication options, and production-ready features including Delta Lake integration and comprehensive comparison logic. Output 2 is more streamlined with focus on dimension table population and REST API integration. Both achieve the core objective with different implementation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: automating Synapse SQL execution, data export to ADLS, Fabric SQL execution, and result validation. Output 1 focuses on general table migration with Delta Lake format, while Output 2 specifically targets dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT). Both implement similar workflow stages but with different technical approaches - Output 1 uses direct SQL connections and Delta format, Output 2 uses REST APIs and Parquet format. The semantic intent and business logic are highly aligned despite implementation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with 10 main sections: imports, configuration, authentication, execution functions, export logic, ADLS transfer, Fabric setup, comparison logic, cleanup, and main orchestration. Output 1 has more granular function decomposition (lines 45-280) with separate functions for each authentication method and detailed comparison logic. Output 2 has a more compact structure (lines 35-200) with combined functions and streamlined flow. Both use similar import statements and configuration patterns, but differ in function organization and error handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,92,45-50,"Output 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, valid import statements, and well-formed function definitions. Minor issues include: undefined variable reference used as both variable name and token value (line 47), and placeholder comments for Fabric execution that may cause runtime errors in production (lines 180-185). All other syntax elements including exception handling, SQL connection strings, and DataFrame operations are correctly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,88,120-125,"Output 2 shows good syntactic correctness with proper Python structure and valid imports. Issues identified: missing import for 'requests' module used in Fabric API calls (line 15), potential undefined behavior in REST API simulation functions (lines 120-125), and hardcoded API cost calculations that may not reflect actual usage. The DataFrame operations, file handling, and basic SQL connection logic are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90 reflects both outputs being production-ready with minor syntax and implementation issues that can be easily resolved. Both demonstrate solid understanding of required libraries and Python best practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,N/A,45-50,"Fix undefined variable reference in authentication function and replace Fabric execution placeholders with actual implementation. Consider adding more robust error handling for ADLS operations and Delta Lake dependencies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,N/A,15-120,"Add missing 'requests' import statement and implement actual Fabric REST API endpoints instead of simulation functions. Enhance error handling for API failures and add retry logic for network operations. Consider parameterizing API cost calculations based on actual usage metrics."
