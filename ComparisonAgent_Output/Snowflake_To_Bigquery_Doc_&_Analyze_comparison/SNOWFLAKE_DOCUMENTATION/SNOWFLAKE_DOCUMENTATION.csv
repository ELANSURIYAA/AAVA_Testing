Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Snowflake SQL scripts analyzing customer sales data. Agent 1 presents a structured numbered format while Agent 2 uses professional Markdown formatting. Both cover identical core topics: program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Key differences lie in presentation style, depth of technical detail, and documentation formatting standards."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200+ (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing customer sales data, identifying top customers by region, and categorizing sales transactions. Core semantic elements align perfectly including purpose (customer analytics), business benefits (segmentation and targeting), and technical approach (CTEs, joins, aggregations). Minor semantic divergence in emphasis on enterprise alignment and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-11 sections (Agent 1), Lines 1-11 sections (Agent 2)","Both follow identical 11-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling, and API Cost. Agent 1 uses numbered list format while Agent 2 uses Markdown headers and professional formatting. Logical flow and section decomposition are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Well-structured content with consistent formatting. Minor issues: some technical details lack specificity (line 18: 'Not explicitly mentioned' appears multiple times), and complexity scoring could be more detailed. Overall syntax and internal consistency are excellent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 50-60, 150-160","Excellent Markdown formatting with proper headers, tables, and code blocks. Comprehensive technical details with specific examples. Minor issue: some redundancy in performance optimization sections (lines 150-160). Superior internal consistency and professional presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper structure and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance technical specificity by replacing 'Not explicitly mentioned' with concrete analysis or recommendations. Add more detailed examples in performance optimization and error handling sections. Consider adopting Markdown formatting for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Reduce redundancy in performance optimization sections. Consider adding more quantitative metrics in complexity analysis. Maintain current high standard of technical depth and professional formatting as best practice model."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully document the Snowflake SQL analysis with comprehensive coverage. Agent 2 demonstrates superior presentation and technical depth, making it the preferred format for enterprise documentation standards. Consider standardizing on Agent 2's Markdown approach for future documentation projects."
