Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Both agents produced comprehensive documentation analyzing the same Snowflake SQL script. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment with similar coverage of business purpose, technical implementation, and performance considerations. Structural approaches differ significantly - Agent 1 uses numbered sections while Agent 2 employs markdown formatting. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 51-100","Both outputs address identical core concepts: Snowflake SQL analysis, customer sales data processing, enterprise data warehousing alignment, and business problem resolution. Agent 1 focuses on concise bullet points while Agent 2 provides more narrative explanations. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent 1 highlights specific technical metrics (40 lines, complexity score 60) while Agent 2 provides more detailed business context and includes API cost tracking (49 lines, complexity score 65)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-200+","Both follow similar logical progression through 10-11 main sections covering overview, structure, data flow, mapping, optimization, complexity, and assumptions. However, structural presentation differs significantly: Agent 1 uses numbered hierarchical structure with bullet points, while Agent 2 uses markdown headers, tables, and formatted sections. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like horizontal rules, code blocks, and detailed table formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 85-90","Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity analysis table - some alignment issues in the measurement column. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper bullet point structure and consistent numbering."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-200+","Excellent markdown syntax throughout with proper header hierarchy, table formatting, and consistent structure. Minor issue: some table cells could benefit from better alignment, but overall very well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 1-200+","Consider adopting markdown formatting for better readability and professional presentation. Add more detailed business context and narrative explanations to match the comprehensiveness of Agent 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 1-200+","Maintain excellent formatting standards. Consider adding more specific technical metrics and quantitative analysis elements that were present in Agent 1's more concise approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200+","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology, 2) More detailed error handling recommendations, 3) Specific performance benchmarking data, 4) Enhanced integration guidance for enterprise environments."
