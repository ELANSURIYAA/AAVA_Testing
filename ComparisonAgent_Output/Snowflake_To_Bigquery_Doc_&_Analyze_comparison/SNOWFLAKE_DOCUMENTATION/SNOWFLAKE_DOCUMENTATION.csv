Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive Snowflake SQL documentation covering similar core topics including overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Agent 1 used a numbered list format while Agent 2 used markdown headers. Both addressed the same business problem of customer sales analysis and top customer identification. Key differences include Agent 2's more detailed technical sections, explicit markdown formatting, and higher API cost reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing customer sales data and identifying top customers by region. Core semantic concepts are aligned including customer segmentation, sales performance analysis, and enterprise data warehousing. Agent 2 provides more granular technical details and explicit business alignment discussions. Minor semantic divergence in emphasis on technical implementation details vs business outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both follow similar logical flow with 10-11 main sections covering overview, structure, data flow, mapping, performance, complexity, and assumptions. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-11) while Agent 2 uses markdown headers with subsections. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like horizontal rules, code blocks, and detailed tables. Overall decomposition approach is consistent but presentation format differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Well-formed numbered list structure with consistent formatting. Minor issues: some incomplete sentences in performance optimization section and missing explicit error handling details. All technical references are accurate and table structures are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 50-60, 180-190","Excellent markdown formatting with proper headers, tables, and code blocks. Very minor issues with some table alignment and one incomplete reference to GCP/BigQuery dependencies. All JSON field references and technical specifications are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual agent scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and accurate technical references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider adopting markdown formatting for better readability and standardization. Expand error handling and logging sections with more specific implementation details. Add more detailed technical architecture discussions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach and markdown formatting. Consider reducing some redundancy in technical sections. Clarify GCP/BigQuery references or remove if not applicable to pure Snowflake implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting approach, 2) More explicit error handling implementations, 3) Addition of sample query outputs or screenshots, 4) Version control and change management sections, 5) Security and access control considerations."
