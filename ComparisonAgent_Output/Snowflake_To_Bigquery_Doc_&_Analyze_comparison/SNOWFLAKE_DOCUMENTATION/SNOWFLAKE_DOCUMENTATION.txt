# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents produced comprehensive documentation analyzing the same Snowflake SQL script. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment with similar coverage of business purpose, technical implementation, and performance considerations. Structural approaches differ significantly - Agent_1 uses numbered sections while Agent_2 employs markdown formatting. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address identical core concepts: Snowflake SQL analysis, customer sales data processing, enterprise data warehousing alignment, and business problem resolution. Agent_1 focuses on concise bullet points while Agent_2 provides more narrative explanations. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent_1 highlights specific technical metrics (40 lines, complexity score 60) while Agent_2 provides more detailed business context and includes API cost tracking (49 lines, complexity score 65).

**Line References:** Lines 1-50, 51-100

### Structural Similarity (Score: 72/100)

Both follow similar logical progression through 10-11 main sections covering overview, structure, data flow, mapping, optimization, complexity, and assumptions. However, structural presentation differs significantly: Agent_1 uses numbered hierarchical structure with bullet points, while Agent_2 uses markdown headers, tables, and formatted sections. Agent_2 includes additional structural elements like horizontal rules, code blocks, and detailed table formatting.

**Line References:** Lines 1-200+

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 95/100):** Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity analysis table - some alignment issues in the measurement column. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper bullet point structure and consistent numbering.

**Agent_2 (Score: 98/100):** Excellent markdown syntax throughout with proper header hierarchy, table formatting, and consistent structure. Minor issue: some table cells could benefit from better alignment, but overall very well-formatted.

**Overall Correctness Score: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | 72 | 72 | 72 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **86** | **86** |

## Recommendations

### For Agent_1
Consider adopting markdown formatting for better readability and professional presentation. Add more detailed business context and narrative explanations to match the comprehensiveness of Agent_2's approach.

### For Agent_2  
Maintain excellent formatting standards. Consider adding more specific technical metrics and quantitative analysis elements that were present in Agent_1's more concise approach.

### For Both Agents
Both outputs would benefit from:
1. Standardized complexity scoring methodology
2. More detailed error handling recommendations  
3. Specific performance benchmarking data
4. Enhanced integration guidance for enterprise environments
