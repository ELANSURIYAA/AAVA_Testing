Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains placeholder text ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs to compare. No substantive content was available for semantic, structural, or correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder text provided instead of real content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text to enable meaningful comparison analysis. Ensure outputs contain substantive content related to Snowflake to BigQuery analysis or documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Re-run the comparison process with valid agent outputs that can be evaluated for semantic similarity, structural similarity, and syntactic correctness."
