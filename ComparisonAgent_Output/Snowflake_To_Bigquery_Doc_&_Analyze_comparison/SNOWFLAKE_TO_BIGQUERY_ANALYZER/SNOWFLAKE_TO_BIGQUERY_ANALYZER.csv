Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-62 vs 1-49,"Two comprehensive Snowflake to BigQuery conversion analyses with different approaches and complexity assessments. First Analysis provides broader scope with 15 syntax differences and 75% complexity, while Second Analysis offers more detailed technical breakdown with 6 syntax differences and 65% complexity. Both identify key conversion challenges including semi-structured data handling, type casting, and clustering differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-10 vs 1-10,"Both outputs address identical core objective of Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion analysis. Both identify same primary challenges: semi-structured data extraction, type casting syntax differences, ARRAY_AGG functions, and CLUSTER BY handling. Second Analysis provides more granular technical details and includes complete SQL query content, while First Analysis offers broader conversion scope assessment. Minor divergence in complexity scoring methodology (75 vs 65) but aligned on fundamental conversion requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-62 vs 1-49,"Both follow similar analytical structure: Overview, Detailed Metrics, Conversion Complexity, Conversion Description, Manual Solution, and Syntax Differences count. Second Analysis enhances structure with explicit complexity scoring rationale and complete SQL query inclusion. First Analysis uses more concise bullet-point format, while Second Analysis employs detailed paragraph explanations. Both maintain logical flow from problem identification to solution recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Analysis,95,Lines 1-62,"Syntactically correct documentation with consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage. Minor issue: complexity score of 75 lacks detailed justification methodology. All technical references are accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Analysis,98,Lines 1-49,"Highly accurate and well-structured analysis with explicit complexity scoring methodology (65/100). Includes complete SQL query validation and detailed technical explanations. All syntax references and conversion requirements are precisely documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both analyses demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical content and consistent internal structure. Second Analysis slightly superior due to more rigorous scoring methodology and complete query inclusion."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Analysis,N/A,Lines 20-35,"Enhance complexity scoring with detailed methodology explanation. Consider including complete SQL query examples to improve technical validation and user understanding."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Analysis,N/A,Lines 15-45,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing complexity scoring scale documentation and adding estimated conversion time estimates for project planning purposes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both analyses provide valuable conversion insights. Recommend combining First Analysis's broader scope assessment with Second Analysis's detailed technical methodology for optimal conversion planning. Consider developing standardized complexity scoring framework for consistent evaluation across different SQL conversion projects."
