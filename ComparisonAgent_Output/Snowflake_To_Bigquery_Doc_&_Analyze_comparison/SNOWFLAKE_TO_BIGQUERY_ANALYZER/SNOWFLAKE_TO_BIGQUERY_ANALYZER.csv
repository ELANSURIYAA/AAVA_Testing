Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents analyzed Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion complexity with similar approaches but different levels of detail. Agent_1_Analysis provided a concise overview with complexity score 75, while Agent_2_Analysis delivered more comprehensive analysis with complexity score 65 and included complete SQL code. Key differences include line count discrepancies (62 vs 49), syntax difference counts (15 vs 6), and depth of technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing Snowflake SQL for BigQuery conversion complexity. They identify similar technical challenges including semi-structured data handling, ARRAY_AGG functions, type casting, and CLUSTER BY clauses. However, Agent_2_Analysis provides more granular detail with actual SQL code examples and specific line references, while Agent_1_Analysis offers higher-level strategic insights. The semantic intent aligns strongly despite different presentation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with numbered sections (1-6) covering Overview, Detailed Metrics, Conversion Complexity, Conversion Description, Manual Solution, and Number of Syntax Differences. Agent_2_Analysis enhances this structure by including the complete SQL code and more detailed technical breakdowns. The logical flow is consistent, but Agent_2_Analysis provides deeper technical decomposition with specific code examples and line-by-line analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Analysis,95,Lines 15-20,"Syntactically well-formed analysis with proper formatting and consistent terminology. Minor issue: complexity score of 75 seems high given the relatively straightforward conversion requirements described. All technical terms and SQL concepts are correctly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Analysis,98,Lines 1-49,"Excellent syntactic correctness with properly formatted SQL code, accurate technical descriptions, and consistent terminology throughout. The included SQL code is syntactically valid Snowflake SQL with proper CTE structure, joins, and window functions. Minor formatting inconsistency in the complexity score presentation (65/100 vs just 65 in Agent_1_Analysis)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid technical terminology, and consistent structure. Agent_2_Analysis slightly edges out with complete SQL code validation and more comprehensive technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Analysis,N/A,Lines 1-30,"Consider providing actual SQL code examples to enhance technical credibility and enable practical validation. The high complexity score (75) should be better justified with specific technical challenges. Include more granular breakdown of syntax differences with line-by-line references."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Analysis,N/A,Lines 1-49,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with complete SQL code. Consider standardizing complexity score presentation format for consistency. The lower syntax difference count (6 vs 15) should be reconciled with the detailed technical challenges identified. Consider adding more strategic insights about migration planning and risk mitigation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents should align on complexity scoring methodology and syntax difference counting approaches. Agent_1_Analysis should include code examples, while Agent_2_Analysis should enhance strategic guidance. Consider developing a standardized template for conversion analysis reports to ensure consistency across similar tasks."
