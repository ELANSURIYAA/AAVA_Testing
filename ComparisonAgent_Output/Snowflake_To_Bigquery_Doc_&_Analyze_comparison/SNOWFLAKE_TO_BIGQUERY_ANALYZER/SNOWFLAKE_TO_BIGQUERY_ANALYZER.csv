Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Two comprehensive Snowflake to BigQuery conversion analyses with different approaches to complexity assessment. First output focuses on high-level conversion challenges (complexity 75, 15 syntax differences), while second output provides more detailed analysis with actual SQL code (complexity 65, 6 syntax differences). Both identify key migration challenges including semi-structured data handling, type casting, and Snowflake-specific features."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Snowflake to BigQuery conversion complexity for customer sales data analysis. They identify overlapping key challenges including semi-structured data extraction, ARRAY_AGG functions, CLUSTER BY clauses, type casting syntax, and VARIANT data types. However, the second output provides more comprehensive coverage with actual SQL code examples and more detailed explanations of specific syntax transformations required."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"","Both outputs follow very similar structural organization with numbered sections covering overview, detailed metrics, conversion complexity, conversion description, manual solution, and syntax differences count. The second output enhances this structure by including the complete SQL code content and more detailed breakdown of specific conversion requirements, but maintains the same logical flow and section organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,95,"","Well-formed analysis with clear section organization, accurate technical terminology, and consistent formatting. Minor deduction for less comprehensive coverage compared to the second output and lack of actual code examples for validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,98,"","Highly accurate and complete analysis with proper technical terminology, consistent formatting, and inclusion of actual SQL code for validation. Very minor deduction for slight inconsistency in complexity scoring methodology (65/100 vs simple numeric values)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness and internal consistency with proper technical analysis structure and accurate identification of conversion challenges."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"","Enhance analysis by including actual SQL code examples and more detailed syntax transformation guidance. Consider providing more granular complexity scoring methodology and specific line-by-line conversion examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology and ensuring consistency between summary metrics and detailed analysis sections."
