Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs analyze Snowflake to BigQuery SQL conversion complexity, focusing on semi-structured data handling, type casting, and platform-specific syntax differences. Agent 1 provides a higher complexity assessment (75 vs 65) and identifies more syntax differences (15 vs 6), while Agent 2 includes the complete SQL query and more detailed technical explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-6 (both agents)","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Snowflake to BigQuery conversion complexity. They identify similar key challenges including semi-structured data handling, type casting syntax differences, ARRAY_AGG functions, and CLUSTER BY clause handling. However, Agent 1 focuses more on metadata field access patterns while Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage of window functions and boolean handling."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-6 structure comparison","Both outputs follow similar structural organization with Overview, Detailed Metrics, Conversion Complexity, Conversion Description, Manual Solution, and Number of Syntax Differences sections. Agent 2 includes additional complete SQL query content (lines 7-49) and more detailed subsection breakdowns in the conversion description, while Agent 1 maintains a more concise structure throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_ANALYZER_Agent1,95,"Lines 3-4, Line 6","Agent 1 demonstrates strong technical accuracy in identifying Snowflake-specific features. Minor inconsistency in complexity scoring methodology (75/100 vs stated as percentage). All technical details about JSON field access, ARRAY_AGG, and type casting are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SNOWFLAKE_TO_BIGQUERY_ANALYZER_Agent2,98,"Lines 1-49","Agent 2 shows excellent technical accuracy with complete SQL query validation. All Snowflake syntax examples are correct, BigQuery conversion recommendations are technically sound, and the included SQL query demonstrates proper CTE structure, window functions, and semi-structured data handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,"","Average of both agents' correctness scores"
