Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45","Agent outputs show fundamental differences in scope and completeness. Thought_Process provides a brief procedural note about file availability, while BigQuery_Analysis delivers comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis with detailed technical breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45","Outputs address completely different aspects - one focuses on process coordination while the other provides technical cost analysis. No semantic alignment in intent or purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45","Thought_Process uses simple narrative structure while BigQuery_Analysis employs structured sections with headers, tables, and detailed breakdowns. Minimal structural overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Thought_Process,95,"Lines 1-3","Syntactically correct thought process format with proper structure and clear communication intent. Minor deduction for incomplete action resolution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,BigQuery_Analysis,98,"Lines 1-45","Comprehensive technical analysis with accurate calculations, proper formatting, structured presentation, and complete coverage of requirements. Minor formatting inconsistencies in table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"
