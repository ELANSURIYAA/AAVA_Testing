Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-85","Agent_Wait_Response provides a minimal procedural statement about waiting for coworker response, while Agent_Cost_Analysis delivers a comprehensive technical analysis with BigQuery cost estimation ($2.00 USD), detailed effort breakdown (12.0 hours), and structured recommendations. The outputs serve completely different purposes with no semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-85","Outputs address entirely different aspects of the task. Agent_Wait_Response focuses on process coordination and file availability issues, while Agent_Cost_Analysis provides detailed technical cost estimation and migration effort analysis. No shared intent or meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-85","Completely different structural approaches. Agent_Wait_Response uses simple thought format, while Agent_Cost_Analysis employs structured sections with headers, tables, bullet points, and detailed breakdowns. No structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Wait_Response,85,"Lines 1-3","Syntactically correct thought statement but incomplete for the task requirements. Missing actual analysis content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Cost_Analysis,95,"Lines 1-85","Well-structured, complete analysis with proper formatting, accurate calculations, and comprehensive coverage. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in table structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Wait_Response,,"Lines 1-3","Complete the analysis task instead of waiting. Provide cost estimation and effort breakdown as required."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Cost_Analysis,,"Lines 1-85","Maintain the comprehensive approach. Consider adding more granular time estimates for specific BigQuery syntax conversions."
