Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Brief_Response provides a single incomplete thought about waiting for clarification, while Detailed_Analysis delivers comprehensive BigQuery migration cost estimation ($2.00 USD runtime cost, 12.0 hours effort) with structured breakdown of manual fixes, testing, and validation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Outputs address completely different aspects of the task. Brief_Response (Lines 1-3) indicates uncertainty and dependency on external input, while Detailed_Analysis (Lines 1-45) provides comprehensive migration planning with specific cost calculations, effort estimates, and technical breakdown. Minimal semantic overlap as one is incomplete and the other is comprehensive."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 4-45,"Fundamentally different structural approaches. Brief_Response uses single thought block format, while Detailed_Analysis employs multi-section structure with numbered sections (1. BigQuery Runtime Cost, 2. Code Fixing Effort, 3. API Cost), tables, bullet points, and systematic breakdown. No structural alignment between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Brief_Response,85,Lines 1-3,"Syntactically correct markdown format with proper code block structure. However, incomplete response that doesn't address the core requirements. Missing substantive content and analysis expected for the task."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Analysis,95,Lines 4-45,"Well-structured document with proper markdown formatting, accurate calculations ($2.00 cost calculation: 0.4 TB × $5), and comprehensive effort breakdown. Minor formatting inconsistency in summary table alignment (Line 43-45) but overall excellent technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of Brief_Response (85) and Detailed_Analysis (95). Both outputs are syntactically correct but vary significantly in completeness and technical depth."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Brief_Response,,Lines 1-3,"Complete the analysis with specific cost calculations, effort estimates, and technical breakdown as demonstrated in Detailed_Analysis. Address the core requirements rather than indicating dependency on external input."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Analysis,,Lines 43-45,"Minor formatting improvements needed in summary table alignment. Consider adding risk assessment and timeline considerations to enhance the comprehensive analysis already provided."
