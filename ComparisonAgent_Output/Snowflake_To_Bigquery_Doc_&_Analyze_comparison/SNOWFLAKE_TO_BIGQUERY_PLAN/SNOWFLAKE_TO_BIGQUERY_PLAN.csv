Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Agent Snowflake_Initial demonstrates incomplete task execution with procedural uncertainty, while Agent Bigquery_Analysis delivers comprehensive technical documentation with detailed cost analysis, effort estimation, and structured deliverables. The outputs represent fundamentally different completion levels and approaches to the migration planning task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Minimal semantic alignment. Agent Snowflake_Initial focuses on process uncertainty and file availability issues (lines 1-3), while Agent Bigquery_Analysis provides complete technical analysis including cost estimation ($2.00 USD), effort breakdown (12.0 hours), and API costs (0.03 USD). Both relate to BigQuery migration but address entirely different aspects with no overlapping intent or conclusions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-45,"Fundamentally different structural approaches. Agent Snowflake_Initial uses simple procedural format with single thought statement, while Agent Bigquery_Analysis employs comprehensive document structure with numbered sections, subsections (A/B/C), bullet points, tables, and systematic breakdown. No structural commonality beyond basic text formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Snowflake_Initial,85,Lines 1-3,"Syntactically correct procedural statement with proper grammar and logical flow. Minor issue: lacks specific context about what files or coworker response is needed, but maintains internal consistency and clear communication intent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Bigquery_Analysis,95,Lines 1-45,"Highly structured and syntactically correct technical document. Proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations, accurate table structure, and logical flow. Minor formatting inconsistency in summary table alignment (lines 35-40) but otherwise exemplary technical documentation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs maintain syntactic integrity within their respective formats and purposes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Snowflake_Initial,N/A,Lines 1-3,"Complete the task execution by providing substantive technical analysis similar to Agent Bigquery_Analysis. Address file availability issues proactively and deliver concrete migration planning deliverables rather than procedural uncertainty statements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Bigquery_Analysis,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Maintain current high-quality documentation standards. Consider adding more detailed breakdown of individual syntax conversion efforts and include risk mitigation strategies for potential BigQuery-specific limitations or performance considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Establish consistent task completion standards and ensure both agents deliver comparable depth of analysis. Agent Snowflake_Initial should adopt the comprehensive approach demonstrated by Agent Bigquery_Analysis for future migration planning tasks."
