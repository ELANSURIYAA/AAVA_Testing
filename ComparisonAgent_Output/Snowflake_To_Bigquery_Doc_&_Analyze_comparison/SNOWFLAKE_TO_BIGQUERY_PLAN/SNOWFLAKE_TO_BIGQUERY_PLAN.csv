Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Agent_1_Output provides a brief procedural statement about waiting for clarification (1 line), while Agent_2_Output delivers a comprehensive technical analysis with cost estimations and effort breakdowns (47+ lines). Semantic similarity is minimal due to completely different purposes and scopes. Structural similarity is low as one follows a simple thought format while the other uses structured sections with tables and calculations. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent_1_Output: Line 1, Agent_2_Output: All lines","Agent_1_Output addresses procedural workflow management (waiting for coworker response), while Agent_2_Output focuses on technical cost analysis and migration effort estimation. The outputs serve completely different purposes with no overlapping intent or meaning. Agent_1_Output is about process coordination, Agent_2_Output is about technical analysis and planning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,25,"Agent_1_Output: Line 1, Agent_2_Output: Lines 1-47","Agent_1_Output follows a simple single-statement format within code blocks. Agent_2_Output uses structured sections with headers, bullet points, calculations, and summary tables. The structural approaches are fundamentally different - minimal vs. comprehensive documentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,Line 1,"Syntactically correct thought statement properly formatted within code blocks. No syntax errors or internal inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,"Lines 5-6, 15-16","Generally well-structured with proper markdown formatting and calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in table alignment and some spacing irregularities, but no syntax errors that would prevent parsing or understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs are syntactically sound with only minor formatting variations in Agent_2_Output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,Line 1,"Consider expanding the procedural statement to include specific next steps, timeline expectations, and fallback procedures if coworker response is delayed."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Lines 5-6, 15-16","Improve table formatting consistency and spacing. Consider adding uncertainty ranges to effort estimates and including risk factors that could affect the 12-hour estimate."
