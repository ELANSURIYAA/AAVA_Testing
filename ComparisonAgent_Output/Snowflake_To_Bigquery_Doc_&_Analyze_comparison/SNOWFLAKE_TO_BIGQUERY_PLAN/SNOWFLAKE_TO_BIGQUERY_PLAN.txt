# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. The provided input contained template variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) that were not populated with actual agent outputs to compare.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. The analysis requires concrete content to assess meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between the two agent outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. This dimension requires examining logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches used by each agent.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content
- **Agent 2**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content
- **Overall**: N/A/100 - Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace template variables with actual agent output content to enable comprehensive comparison analysis.

2. **Ensure Complete Input**: Verify that both agent outputs are fully populated and contain the content that needs to be compared.

3. **Specify Output Type**: Indicate whether the outputs are code, documentation, analysis reports, or test cases to apply appropriate evaluation criteria.
