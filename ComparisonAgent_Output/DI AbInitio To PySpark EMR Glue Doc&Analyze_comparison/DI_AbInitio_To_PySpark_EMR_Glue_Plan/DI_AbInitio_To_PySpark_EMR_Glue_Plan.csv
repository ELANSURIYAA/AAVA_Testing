Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent1), Lines 1-60 (Agent2)","Both agents provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis for Ab Initio to PySpark migration with similar overall structure and purpose. Agent1 focuses on concise cost breakdown with 24-hour effort estimate totaling $1,206.63. Agent2 provides more detailed technical specifications with 30-hour effort estimate totaling $1,506.62. Key differences include DPU allocation (10 vs 20), job duration (90 vs 45 minutes), and effort estimation methodology. Both maintain professional documentation standards with clear cost formulas and assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-25 (Agent1), Lines 7-30 (Agent2)","Both outputs address identical migration analysis goals with similar AWS cost calculation approaches. Agent1 uses conservative 10 DPU allocation while Agent2 uses 20 DPU median approach. Both apply same $0.44 per DPU-hour rate and similar storage calculations. Semantic alignment is strong in cost methodology, effort categorization (Logic Corrections, Metadata Alignment, Rejected Row Handling, Data Reconciliation), and technical assumptions. Minor divergence in duration estimates (90 vs 45 minutes) reflects different optimization assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Agent1), Lines 1-60 (Agent2)","Excellent structural alignment with both following identical section hierarchy: AWS EMR Glue Cost Estimation, Manual Code Fixing Effort, API Cost, Summary Table. Both use consistent subsection numbering (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, etc.) and table formatting. Agent2 adds sections 4-6 (Summary Table as separate section, Conversion Notes, Recommendations) providing enhanced structure. Both maintain professional document formatting with clear cost formulas, effort breakdowns, and assumption documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Agent1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Agent1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with valid markdown formatting, consistent table structure, and accurate mathematical calculations. Cost formula properly applied: 10 DPUs × 1.5 hours × $0.44 = $6.60. Effort calculation correct: 24 hours × $50 = $1,200. Minor formatting inconsistency in developer rate presentation (backticks vs standard formatting). All internal references consistent and no broken syntax detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Agent2,97,"Lines 18-25, 45-50","Agent2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with enhanced markdown formatting, comprehensive table structures, and accurate calculations. Cost formula correctly applied: 20 DPUs × 0.75 hours × $0.44 = $6.60. Effort calculation accurate: 30 hours × $50 = $1,500. Superior formatting consistency throughout document. All section references valid, proper markdown syntax, and comprehensive technical detail presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,"All lines reviewed","Both agents demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid document structure, accurate mathematical calculations, and consistent formatting. Agent2 slightly superior due to enhanced formatting consistency and comprehensive section organization. No syntax errors, broken references, or calculation mistakes detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Agent1,85,"Lines 35-45","Strengthen technical detail presentation by adding comprehensive conversion notes and specific recommendations section similar to Agent2. Consider expanding effort estimation methodology to include more granular task breakdown. Enhance formatting consistency throughout document, particularly in developer rate presentation and table structures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Agent2,90,"Lines 55-65","Excellent comprehensive approach with detailed technical specifications and recommendations. Consider adding more conservative duration estimates as alternative scenarios. The 45-minute estimate may be optimistic for 200GB batch processing. Maintain the superior formatting and structural organization demonstrated."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,88,"All sections","Both agents provide solid migration analysis foundation. Recommend combining Agent1's conservative estimates with Agent2's comprehensive technical detail and recommendation structure. Consider developing hybrid approach using Agent2's format with Agent1's conservative timing assumptions for risk mitigation. Both should standardize on consistent markdown formatting patterns for enterprise documentation standards."
