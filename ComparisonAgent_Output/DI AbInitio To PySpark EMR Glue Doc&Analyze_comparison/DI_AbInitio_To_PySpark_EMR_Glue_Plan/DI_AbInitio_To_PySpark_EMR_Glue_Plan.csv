Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-95 vs 1-120","Both outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis for Ab Initio ETL flow migration to PySpark EMR/Glue. Agent 1 focuses on core cost components with concise presentation, while Agent 2 provides expanded analysis with additional technical recommendations and conversion notes. Key differences include effort estimates (24 vs 30 hours), API costs ($0.0159 vs $0.0174), and structural organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 10-50 vs 15-65","Both outputs address identical migration analysis goals with AWS cost estimation, developer effort calculation, and API costs. Core semantic intent is highly aligned. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses on cost breakdown precision while Agent 2 emphasizes technical implementation guidance. Both conclude with similar total cost projections ($1,206.63 vs ~$1,506.62)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-95 vs 1-120","Similar overall flow with AWS cost estimation, manual effort analysis, and summary sections. Agent 1 uses 3 main sections plus summary, Agent 2 uses 6 sections including additional conversion notes and recommendations. Both employ tabular cost breakdowns but Agent 2 provides more granular task categorization and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 25-30, 65-70","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper markdown syntax, and accurate internal references. Minor issue: Storage cost calculation methodology could be clearer in formula presentation. All tables properly formatted and calculations appear mathematically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 35-40, 85-90","Generally well-structured with proper markdown formatting and consistent section organization. Minor formatting inconsistencies in cost formula presentation and some redundant information in conversion notes section. Mathematical calculations are accurate and tables are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting, consistent internal structure, and accurate mathematical calculations. Minor presentation and formatting variations do not impact overall correctness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 40-50","Strengthen storage cost calculation methodology explanation and provide more detailed breakdown of DPU allocation rationale. Consider adding technical implementation guidance similar to Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 90-110","Improve formatting consistency in cost formulas and reduce redundancy in conversion notes section. The additional technical recommendations and complexity scoring add significant value and should be retained."
