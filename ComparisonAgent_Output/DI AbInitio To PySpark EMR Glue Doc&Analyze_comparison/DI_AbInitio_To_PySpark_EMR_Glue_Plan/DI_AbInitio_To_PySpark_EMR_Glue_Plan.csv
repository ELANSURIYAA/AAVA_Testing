Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content. To complete the comparison, please provide the actual outputs from both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic similarity assessment requires analyzing the meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between two outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural similarity assessment requires analyzing logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 1: Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 2: Ensure agent outputs contain sufficient content for semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Recommendation 3: Include context about the task or domain to enable more targeted comparison criteria."
