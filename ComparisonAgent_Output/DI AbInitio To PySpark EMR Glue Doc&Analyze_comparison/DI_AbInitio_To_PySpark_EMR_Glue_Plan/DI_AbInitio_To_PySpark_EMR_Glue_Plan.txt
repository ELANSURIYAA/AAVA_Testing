# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual content. To complete the comparison, please provide the actual outputs from both agents.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic similarity assessment requires analyzing the meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between two outputs. This dimension would typically evaluate:
- Whether both outputs address the same inferred goal
- If they apply similar transformations or reasoning
- Whether conclusions or outcomes are aligned in meaning

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural similarity assessment requires analyzing logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches. This dimension would typically evaluate:
- Order of steps or stages
- Use of logical blocks (CTEs, functions, sections, phases)
- Control flow and decomposition approach
- Schema or component hierarchy

### Correctness

**Agent_1**: N/A/100
- Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output

**Agent_2**: N/A/100  
- Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output

**Overall**: N/A/100
- Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide actual agent outputs**: Replace placeholder variables with actual content from both agents to enable meaningful comparison analysis.

2. **Ensure sufficient content**: Make sure agent outputs contain enough substantive content for semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation across all dimensions.

3. **Include task context**: Provide context about the task or domain (e.g., data integration, PySpark migration, documentation analysis) to enable more targeted comparison criteria.
