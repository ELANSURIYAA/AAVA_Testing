Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as the actual agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} instead of actual content. To complete this analysis, please provide the actual outputs from both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic similarity analysis requires comparing the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires examining logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Include any relevant metadata or context for accurate evaluation. 4. Specify the expected output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test case) if not apparent from content."
