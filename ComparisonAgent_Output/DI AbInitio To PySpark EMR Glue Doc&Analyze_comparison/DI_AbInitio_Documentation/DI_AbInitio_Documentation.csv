Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the Retail_Data_Mart_Ingest Ab Initio graph. The outputs are semantically identical with 95% similarity, covering the same business logic, data flow, transformations, and technical specifications. Structural similarity is 88% - both follow similar section organization but Agent_2 uses superior markdown formatting. Correctness is high for both (Agent_1: 98%, Agent_2: 100%, Overall: 99%) with minor formatting inconsistencies in Agent_1. Agent_2 demonstrates better documentation practices with proper markdown structure, tables, and visual hierarchy."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All Lines,"Both outputs describe identical business requirements, data processing logic, and technical implementation. Core content including component structure (11 components), data flow (8 processing steps), transformation logic (3 XFR files), and business rules are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in phrasing and emphasis (e.g., 'mained off' vs 'logged separately' at line 45 vs line 52) do not affect meaning. Both correctly identify the same complexity metrics, error handling approaches, and output specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All Lines,"Both documents follow similar high-level organization with 9 main sections (Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost). Agent_2 uses superior markdown formatting with proper headers (#, ##), tables, code blocks, and bullet points for better readability. Agent_1 uses plain text with basic formatting. Section ordering is identical. Data mapping tables are structurally similar but Agent_2 has better table formatting (lines 89-98 vs lines 95-104). Both maintain consistent logical flow from ingestion through output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 45-46,"Agent_1 documentation is syntactically correct with consistent formatting throughout. Minor issue: 'mained off' should be 'routed' or 'directed' (line 45). All technical references, component names, file names, and data flow descriptions are accurate and internally consistent. Section numbering, bullet points, and table structure are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All Lines,"Agent_2 documentation demonstrates perfect markdown syntax with proper headers, tables, code blocks, and formatting. All technical content is accurate and internally consistent. Markdown table syntax is correct (lines 95-104), code blocks are properly formatted, and all references are valid. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Overall correctness is excellent with both outputs maintaining high technical accuracy and proper formatting within their respective formats. Average of Agent_1 (98%) and Agent_2 (100%) scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 45-46,"Consider adopting markdown formatting for improved readability and professional presentation. Replace informal phrasing like 'mained off' with more precise technical terminology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,All Lines,"Excellent documentation standard achieved. Consider adding more detailed code examples or configuration snippets to enhance technical depth while maintaining current formatting quality."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical documentation capabilities. Standardize on markdown format (Agent_2 approach) for consistency across documentation deliverables. Consider adding visual diagrams or flowcharts to complement the textual descriptions of the data flow and component relationships."
