Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided inputs contain template variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) that have not been populated with actual agent outputs. No actual content was provided for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no actual output provided, only template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no actual output provided, only template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure agent outputs are properly formatted and contain actual content. 3. Re-run the comparison once real outputs are available."
