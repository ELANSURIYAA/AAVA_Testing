Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-100,"Both agents provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis of Ab Initio ETL flow for PySpark EMR/Glue migration. Agent 1 presents a more concise structure with complexity score 68, while Agent 2 provides more detailed analysis with complexity score 75. Both identify similar components and migration challenges but differ in presentation depth and recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Ab Initio to PySpark migration. They identify identical components (Read_AWS_S3, Read_Product_Dim, Cleanse_Data, etc.) and similar transformation requirements. Key semantic alignment includes: component behavior descriptions, PySpark equivalent mappings, and manual intervention needs. Minor divergence in complexity scoring (68 vs 75) and refactor vs rebuild recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both follow similar analytical structure with component tables, manual interventions, complexity evaluation, and recommendations sections. Agent 1 uses more compact formatting while Agent 2 provides expanded sections with additional subsections. Structural differences: Agent 1 has 4 main sections, Agent 2 has 6 sections including source file references. Both use tabular component analysis as primary structural element."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,15-25,"Minor formatting inconsistency in table structure. Some cells contain 'maining' instead of 'remaining' (line 15). Overall syntax and internal references are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,45-55,"Well-formed structure with consistent formatting. Minor typo 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears multiple times instead of 'report' (lines 45, 50, 55). All internal references and schema mentions are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting and typographical issues. Internal consistency is maintained throughout both documents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,1-100,"Strengthen table formatting consistency and correct terminology ('maining' to 'remaining'). Consider expanding performance recommendations section for better alignment with industry standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,45-55,"Correct recurring typo 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' to 'report'. Consider consolidating some sections to improve readability while maintaining comprehensive coverage."
