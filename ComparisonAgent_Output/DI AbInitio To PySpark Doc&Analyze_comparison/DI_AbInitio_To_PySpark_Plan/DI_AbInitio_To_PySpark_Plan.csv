Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs are comprehensive cost estimation reports for Ab Initio to PySpark migration of dental claim detail ETL processes. They share identical purpose and structure but differ in specific calculations, cluster configurations, and cost breakdowns. Output 1 focuses on IODS_CONS_CSV_DNTL_CLMDTL_HX_BR1 with 4-node cluster and $1.52 runtime cost, while Output 2 analyzes dental claim detail history ETL with 5-node cluster and $4.12 runtime cost. Both include developer effort estimates around $1,500-1,600 and minimal API costs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Both outputs address identical migration goals with same analytical framework. Minor differences in specific ETL processes (claim detail vs claim detail history) and data volumes, but core intent and methodology are nearly identical. Both conclude with similar developer effort estimates and emphasize manual intervention requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 35-45","Identical section structure: GCP Runtime Cost, Manual Effort, API Cost, Summary Table, Notes/Recommendations. Output 2 includes additional Migration Analysis section and Appendix. Both use consistent formatting with headers, bullet points, tables, and cost formulas. Minor variations in subsection organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 20-25, 30-35","Well-formed document with consistent formatting. Minor issues: missing creation date in header, some approximations in storage cost calculations ($0.02 vs $0.0174 discrepancy in line 25). All mathematical calculations are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,All lines,"Excellent document structure with complete headers, detailed appendix, and comprehensive assumptions section. All calculations are precise and well-documented. Mathematical formulas are clearly presented with step-by-step breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate mathematical calculations. Output 2 slightly superior due to more complete documentation structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Consider adding more detailed cluster configuration rationale and storage cost breakdown precision. Include assumptions section for transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 60-70,"Excellent comprehensive structure. Consider standardizing cost calculation presentation to match the clarity of effort estimation tables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for migration planning. Recommend standardizing cluster sizing methodology and creating template for consistent cost estimation across similar ETL migrations."
