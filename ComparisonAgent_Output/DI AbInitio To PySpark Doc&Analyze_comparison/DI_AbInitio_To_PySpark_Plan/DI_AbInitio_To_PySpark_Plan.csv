Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs are comprehensive cost estimation reports for Ab Initio to PySpark migration of dental claim detail ETL. Agent_1_Output estimates total cost at $1,601.54 with 2.5-hour runtime and $1.52 GCP cost. Agent_2_Output estimates $1,504.13 with 1-hour runtime and $4.12 GCP cost. Both follow similar structure but differ in cluster configuration, runtime estimates, and cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs address the same core objective: cost estimation for Ab Initio to PySpark migration. They cover identical cost components (GCP runtime, developer effort, API costs) and provide similar analytical depth. Key semantic differences: Agent_1_Output uses 4 nodes vs Agent_2_Output's 5 nodes, different runtime estimates (2.5h vs 1h), and different effort estimates (32h vs 30h). Both conclude with similar recommendations about manual interventions and testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) GCP Runtime Cost Estimation with cluster configuration and cost breakdown, 2) Manual Code Fixing effort estimation with task breakdown table, 3) API Cost section, 4) Summary Table, 5) Notes/Recommendations section. Agent_2_Output includes additional sections (Migration Analysis, References, Appendix) making it more comprehensive. Both use consistent markdown formatting, tables, and mathematical formulas."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 15-25,"Minor inconsistency in pricing explanation at lines 20-22 where $0.15/node/hr is used despite calculating $0.624/node/hr, but author acknowledges this discrepancy. All other calculations are mathematically correct and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,Lines 10-30,"All calculations are mathematically accurate and internally consistent. Cluster configuration math is correct (20 vCPUs total), cost formulas are properly applied, and all numerical values align correctly throughout the document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, valid mathematical calculations, and consistent internal references. Average correctness score reflects minor pricing explanation issue in Agent_1_Output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 180-200,"Consider adding more detailed sections like Migration Analysis and References as seen in Agent_2_Output. Clarify the pricing discrepancy explanation in the GCP cost section to avoid confusion."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 200-250,"Excellent comprehensive structure. Consider including the data volume processing estimates that Agent_1_Output provides for better context on storage requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-250,"Both outputs provide solid cost estimation frameworks. Consider standardizing cluster configuration assumptions and runtime estimates for consistency. Both should validate their different approaches to storage cost calculation (GCS vs persistent disk) for accuracy."
