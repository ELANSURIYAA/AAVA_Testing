Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-100, 1-150","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation reports for Ab Initio to PySpark migration with similar structure and intent. Agent_1_Output estimates total cost of $1,601.54 while Agent_2_Output estimates $1,504.13. Key differences include cluster configuration (Agent_1: 4 nodes vs Agent_2: 5 nodes), runtime estimates (Agent_1: 2.5 hours vs Agent_2: 1 hour), and pricing models used."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-15, 10-25","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating migration costs with three main components: GCP runtime, developer effort, and API costs. Agent_1_Output focuses on 'Cost and effort estimation' while Agent_2_Output emphasizes 'Pre-conversion analysis and cost estimation'. Both include similar task breakdowns for manual effort (logic corrections, metadata alignment, rejected row handling, data reconciliation) with slight variations in estimated hours (32 vs 30 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-100, 1-150","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: (1) GCP Runtime Cost Estimation with cluster configuration and cost breakdown, (2) Manual Code Fixing and Data Reconciliation Effort with task tables, (3) API Cost, (4) Summary Table, (5) Notes & Recommendations/Migration Analysis. Agent_2_Output includes additional sections (References, Appendix) providing more comprehensive documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,"Lines 20-35","Syntax and formatting are excellent. Minor inconsistency in pricing explanation (mentions $0.156/vCPU/hr but uses $0.15/node/hr). All calculations are mathematically correct and tables are well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,"Lines 25-40","Excellent syntax, formatting, and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations are accurate (20 vCPUs × 1 hour × $0.156 = $3.12). Pricing model is clearly explained and consistently applied throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, accurate calculations, and consistent internal references. Agent_2_Output has slightly better consistency in pricing explanations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Lines 85-95","Consider adopting the more detailed cluster configuration explanation from Agent_2_Output. Clarify the pricing model inconsistency between per-vCPU and per-node rates for better transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Lines 120-140","Excellent comprehensive structure. Consider adding the specific abort-on-reject logic details from Agent_1_Output for completeness in regulatory requirements discussion."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs provide solid cost estimation frameworks. Consider standardizing on Agent_2_Output's pricing model clarity while incorporating Agent_1_Output's specific regulatory compliance details. The $97 difference in total estimates should be reconciled through standardized assumptions."
