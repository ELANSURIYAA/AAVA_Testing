Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc and DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis reports for migrating Ab Initio ETL flows to PySpark. The reports demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with both addressing identical migration goals, component analysis, and technical recommendations. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with consistent report organization, though some formatting and section ordering differences exist. Correctness scores are high for both agents (DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc: 95/100, DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer: 93/100) with minor formatting inconsistencies. Overall assessment: 92/100 - Both outputs are production-ready with excellent technical depth and actionable insights."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address identical migration objectives with consistent technical analysis. Key alignments: (1) Component breakdown covers same ETL elements - Input Table, Reformat, Sort, Dedup, Output operations; (2) Manual intervention identification is nearly identical - .xfr logic translation, DML type mapping, parameter set handling; (3) Complexity scoring methodology is consistent (DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc: 75/100, DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer: 85/100) with similar justification criteria; (4) Performance recommendations overlap significantly - broadcast joins, caching, avoiding UDFs, partitioning strategies; (5) Both recommend REBUILD over refactor with similar rationale. Minor semantic differences: DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer provides slightly more detailed component count analysis and error handling discussion."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both reports follow consistent structural patterns with well-organized sections. Structural alignments: (1) Header sections with author/description metadata; (2) Component analysis sections with PySpark equivalents; (3) Manual intervention sections; (4) Complexity evaluation with numerical scoring; (5) Performance recommendations; (6) Refactor vs Rebuild sections; (7) API cost reporting. Structural differences: DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc uses more granular subsections (lines 15-45) with numbered component breakdowns, while DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer uses bullet-point format (lines 12-35). DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc includes dedicated 'Chained/Conditional Flows' subsection (lines 46-52) that DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer integrates into component descriptions. Both conclude with manual task checklists but with different formatting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc,95,Lines 1-3,"Minor formatting inconsistency in header block - missing closing braces in metadata section. Otherwise excellent syntax with proper markdown formatting, consistent section headers, numbered lists, and proper code block usage throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer,93,"Lines 1-4, Lines 89-91","Two syntax issues identified: (1) Header formatting inconsistency with mixed markdown and comment styles (lines 1-4); (2) Minor formatting issue in API cost section with inconsistent spacing (lines 89-91). Otherwise strong syntax with proper markdown structure, consistent bullet points, and appropriate code formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor formatting inconsistencies that do not impact readability or technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc,N/A,N/A,"Excellent technical depth with comprehensive component analysis and clear PySpark migration guidance. Recommend addressing minor header formatting inconsistency (lines 1-3). Strengths: detailed .xfr translation guidance, thorough performance optimization recommendations, clear complexity scoring rationale."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer,N/A,N/A,"Strong technical analysis with detailed component breakdown and practical migration insights. Recommend standardizing header formatting (lines 1-4) and API cost section spacing (lines 89-91). Strengths: comprehensive error handling discussion, detailed component count analysis, thorough manual task documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide production-ready migration analysis with excellent technical accuracy. Key recommendations: (1) Standardize report formatting for consistency; (2) Consider merging the detailed component analysis approaches - DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Doc's granular numbering with DI_AbInitio_To_PySpark_Analyzer's comprehensive descriptions; (3) Both complexity scores (75 vs 85) are well-justified but could benefit from standardized scoring criteria; (4) Excellent alignment on REBUILD recommendation and technical approach validates the analysis quality."
