Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-200,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis of Ab Initio ETL flow for PySpark migration. Agent 1 (First Output) provides more structured component breakdown with detailed PySpark equivalents and specific technical recommendations. Agent 2 (Second Output) offers similar analysis but with different organizational approach and emphasis on error handling complexity. Both reach similar conclusions regarding rebuild recommendation and complexity scoring."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs address identical core objective: analyzing Ab Initio ETL flow for PySpark migration. Both identify same key components (Input Table with BigQuery SQL, Reformat operations, Sort/Dedup, Partition by Key, Output operations). Both recognize need for manual .xfr translation, DML type mapping, and parameter set handling. Both recommend rebuild over refactor. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on performance optimization specifics, Agent 2 emphasizes error handling complexity more heavily. Both provide similar complexity scores (75 vs 85)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,1-50,"Both follow similar high-level structure: Header/Metadata, Syntax & Logical Structure Analysis, Component Breakdown, Manual Interventions, Complexity Evaluation, Performance Recommendations, Refactor vs Rebuild decision. However, Agent 1 uses more granular subsections (8 numbered components vs Agent 2's bullet-point approach). Agent 1 includes specific 'Chained/Conditional Flows' subsection while Agent 2 integrates this into component descriptions. Both conclude with manual tasks/checkpoints but Agent 1 provides numbered list (10 items) vs Agent 2's bullet points. API cost reporting differs in format and values."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First Output,95,1-200,"Well-structured markdown with consistent formatting. All internal references are coherent. Component numbering is sequential and logical (1-9). Proper use of markdown syntax throughout. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section format. All technical terms and concepts are used correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second Output,93,1-180,"Properly formatted markdown with consistent structure. All bullet points and subsections are well-organized. Technical terminology is accurate throughout. Minor inconsistency in API cost format (different from Agent 1). Some sections could benefit from more structured numbering like Agent 1. Overall syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, and accurate technical terminology. Minor formatting differences in API cost reporting and organizational preferences, but no significant syntax errors or broken references in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First Output,,1-200,"Excellent technical depth and structured approach. Consider adopting the numbered component breakdown format for better readability. The 10-point manual tasks checklist is particularly valuable for implementation teams. Performance recommendations are comprehensive and actionable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second Output,,1-180,"Strong emphasis on error handling complexity which is crucial for Ab Initio migrations. The detailed explanation of reject/error port handling provides important context. Consider adding more specific performance optimization guidance similar to Agent 1. The rebuild rationale is well-articulated."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All,"Both outputs provide valuable complementary perspectives on the same migration challenge. Agent 1 excels in structured technical detail and performance guidance, while Agent 2 provides important context on error handling complexity. Future analysis should combine Agent 1's structured approach with Agent 2's emphasis on Ab Initio-specific behavioral nuances. Both correctly identify the high complexity and rebuild recommendation, making them reliable for migration planning."
