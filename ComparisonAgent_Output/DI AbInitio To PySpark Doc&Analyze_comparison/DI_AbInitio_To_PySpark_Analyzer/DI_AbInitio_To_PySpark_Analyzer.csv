Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs provide comprehensive pre-conversion analysis of Ab Initio ETL flow for PySpark migration. They demonstrate strong semantic alignment (92/100) with nearly identical intent and coverage of key migration considerations. Structural similarity is high (88/100) with both following logical analytical flow, though Agent_1 provides more detailed component breakdown. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each) with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_1 offers more granular technical details while Agent_2 provides clearer categorical organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical core objective: analyzing Ab Initio ETL flow for PySpark migration. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Component analysis covering BigQuery sources, reformats, sorts, deduplication, partitioning; (2) Manual intervention identification for .xfr files, DML mapping, parameter sets; (3) Complexity scoring methodology; (4) Performance recommendations; (5) Rebuild vs refactor decision rationale. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 provides more technical depth on SQL pushdown and error handling specifics, while Agent_2 offers clearer categorization of transformation types. Overall intent and conclusions are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow similar logical structure: (1) Header/metadata section; (2) Syntax & logical structure analysis; (3) Component breakdown with PySpark equivalents; (4) Manual interventions section; (5) Complexity evaluation with scoring; (6) Performance recommendations; (7) Refactor vs rebuild recommendation; (8) Manual tasks checklist. Structural differences: Agent_1 uses more granular subsections and bullet points, includes 'Chained/Conditional Flows' subsection, and provides more detailed component descriptions. Agent_2 uses cleaner categorical organization with consistent formatting. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,"Lines 1-150","Agent_1 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness: (1) Proper markdown formatting throughout; (2) Consistent section headers and bullet points; (3) No broken references or undefined terms; (4) Well-formed code examples and technical specifications; (5) Proper use of technical terminology; (6) Consistent parameter naming and references; (7) No grammatical or formatting errors; (8) All internal cross-references are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-180","Agent_2 output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness: (1) Proper markdown formatting with consistent header hierarchy; (2) Clean bullet point structure and indentation; (3) No broken internal references; (4) Well-formed technical examples and code snippets; (5) Consistent terminology usage; (6) Proper formatting of technical specifications; (7) No syntax errors in markdown or technical content; (8) All section references are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs achieve perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."
