Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive Ab Initio to PySpark migration analysis reports with strong semantic alignment (88/100) and structural similarity (85/100). Agent_1_Output provides more detailed component breakdowns and technical specifications, while Agent_2_Output offers clearer organization and practical implementation guidance. Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper technical terminology and logical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core objective of Ab Initio ETL migration analysis. Key similarities include: component breakdown analysis, manual intervention identification, complexity scoring methodology, and PySpark equivalent mappings. Differences include Agent_1_Output's more granular technical details (lines 15-45) versus Agent_2_Output's streamlined presentation (lines 10-35). Both correctly identify .xfr file translation challenges and parameterization issues."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both reports follow similar structural organization: header/metadata, component analysis, manual interventions, complexity evaluation, and recommendations. Agent_1_Output uses more subsections and bullet points (lines 20-80), while Agent_2_Output employs cleaner section breaks and consistent formatting (lines 15-70). Both include similar section ordering and logical flow progression."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,92,"Lines 1-200","High syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, and logical section flow. Minor issues include some inconsistent bullet point formatting (lines 25-30) and occasional redundant phrasing (lines 85-90). All technical references and PySpark mappings are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,"Lines 1-180","Excellent syntactic correctness with clean markdown formatting, consistent section headers, and proper code block usage. Well-structured bullet points and clear technical explanations throughout. No significant formatting or syntactic issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (92 + 95) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy and proper formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Enhance formatting consistency, particularly in bullet point usage (lines 25-30). Consider streamlining redundant technical explanations (lines 85-90) while maintaining technical depth. The detailed component breakdown is valuable and should be preserved."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Excellent structure and clarity. Consider adding more granular technical details in component analysis sections to match the depth provided by Agent_1_Output. The clean organization serves as a good template for future reports."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for Ab Initio migration planning. Consider combining Agent_1_Output's technical depth with Agent_2_Output's organizational clarity for optimal results. Standardize complexity scoring methodology and ensure consistent parameter handling guidance across both approaches."
