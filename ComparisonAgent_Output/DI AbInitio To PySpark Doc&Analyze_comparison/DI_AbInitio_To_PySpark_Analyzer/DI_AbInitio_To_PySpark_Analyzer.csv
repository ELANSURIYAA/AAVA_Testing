Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive pre-conversion analyses of Ab Initio ETL flows for PySpark migration. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with detailed component breakdowns, manual intervention requirements, and migration recommendations. Key differences include complexity scoring (75 vs 85), structural organization, and depth of specific recommendations. Both outputs are syntactically correct and provide valuable migration guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing Ab Initio ETL flows for PySpark migration. They share identical understanding of component types (BigQuery sources, reformats, sorts, deduplication), transformation requirements, and migration challenges. Both identify the same manual interventions needed (.xfr translation, DML mapping, parameter handling). The primary semantic difference lies in complexity assessment (Agent_1_Output: 75/100, Agent_2_Output: 85/100) and recommendation emphasis (Agent_1_Output focuses on rebuild rationale, Agent_2_Output provides more detailed component mapping)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with component breakdown, manual interventions, complexity evaluation, and recommendations sections. Agent_1_Output uses numbered component analysis (1-9) while Agent_2_Output uses bullet-point component breakdown. Both include identical major sections: Syntax & Logical Structure Analysis, Anticipated Manual Interventions, Complexity Evaluation, Performance & Scalability Recommendations, and Refactor vs. Rebuild Recommendation. The flow and logical progression are nearly identical, with differences primarily in presentation format and subsection organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 45-47,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent terminology, and well-structured content. Minor issue: API cost formatting inconsistency (shows '0.024 USD' vs standard format). All technical references are accurate and component descriptions are syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,N/A,"Agent_2_Output shows superior syntactic correctness with consistent formatting throughout, proper markdown structure, and standardized API cost presentation ('0.0125 USD'). All component descriptions, technical terminology, and structural elements are syntactically accurate with no formatting inconsistencies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper technical documentation standards, accurate component descriptions, and consistent terminology usage. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting variations in Agent_1_Output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 85-95,"Consider standardizing API cost presentation format and maintaining consistent subsection numbering throughout the document. The rebuild recommendation is well-justified but could benefit from more specific component mapping examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 80-90,"Excellent technical accuracy and formatting consistency. Consider adding more quantitative justification for the higher complexity score (85 vs 75) and provide more detailed cost-benefit analysis for the rebuild approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide excellent migration analysis with complementary strengths. Agent_1_Output offers clearer component numbering and detailed overflow handling analysis. Agent_2_Output provides better formatting consistency and more comprehensive error handling discussion. Combined insights would create an optimal migration analysis document."
