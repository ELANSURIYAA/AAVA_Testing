Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Ab Initio ETL graphs processing dental claim detail data. AAVA output offers more detailed technical specifications with 500+ lines of content including specific component names, data mappings, and cost analysis. Ascendion_AVA+ output provides structured documentation with clear business logic explanations and complexity scoring. Both documents serve the same business purpose of documenting dental claim consolidation processes but differ in depth and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both documents address identical business requirements for dental claim detail consolidation using Ab Initio ETL. Core concepts align: BigQuery data extraction, deduplication, provider enrichment, and staging table loading. Minor semantic differences in terminology (e.g., 'consolidation' vs 'enrichment') and emphasis on different aspects (AAVA focuses on technical implementation, Ascendion_AVA+ emphasizes business logic). Both correctly identify the same data sources and target outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both follow documentation standards with numbered sections covering Overview, Components, Data Flow, Mappings, Transformations, Complexity, Outputs, and Error Handling. AAVA uses 9 sections with detailed subsections and tabular data mappings (lines 85-95). Ascendion_AVA+ uses 9 sections with markdown formatting and code blocks. Key structural difference: AAVA provides specific line-by-line data mapping table while Ascendion_AVA+ uses example-based mapping descriptions. Both include complexity analysis but with different scoring approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,95,N/A,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, well-formed tables, and accurate technical references. Minor issues: some parameter references could be clearer (line 45 CSVDNTL_START_DATE), and cost calculation section uses placeholder token values (line 180). All component names, file paths, and technical specifications appear accurate and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+,92,N/A,"Documentation is well-structured with proper markdown syntax, clear code blocks, and consistent formatting. Minor issues include incomplete data mapping examples (lines 85-95 show template format rather than complete mappings), and some technical details are less specific than could be expected for implementation documentation. Error handling section (lines 140-150) could benefit from more specific configuration details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both documents demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation standards. Average score reflects minor issues in completeness and specificity rather than fundamental errors. Both are suitable for their intended purposes as technical documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,N/A,N/A,"Strengthen cost analysis section by replacing placeholder values with actual calculation examples. Consider adding more business context explanations to balance the strong technical focus. The detailed data mapping table (lines 85-95) is excellent and should be maintained as a key differentiator."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+,N/A,N/A,"Complete the data mapping examples with actual field mappings rather than template formats. Add more specific technical details in transformation logic and error handling sections. The business logic emphasis and complexity scoring approach (line 120) are valuable and should be expanded with more quantitative metrics."
