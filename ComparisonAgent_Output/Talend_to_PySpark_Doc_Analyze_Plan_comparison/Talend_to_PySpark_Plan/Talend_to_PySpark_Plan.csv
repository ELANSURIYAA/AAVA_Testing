Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-22 (Output1), Lines 1-22 (Output2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive effort estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical structural organization. Key differences include: hourly estimates for component types (Complex Transformations: 16h vs 20h, Job Control: 12h vs 6h, Context Variables: 4h vs 6h), developer rates ($50 vs $65), total costs ($2800 vs $3640), and API costs (0.0173 vs 0.0630 USD). Both recommend refactoring approach with similar reasoning but different emphasis on complexity factors."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-22 (Both)","Both outputs address identical goal of Talend to PySpark conversion effort estimation. Same intent and purpose with consistent reasoning approach. Minor divergence in complexity assessment and cost assumptions, but overall meaning and conclusions align well. Both recommend refactoring over rebuilding with sound technical justification."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-22 (Both)","Nearly identical structural organization: 1.1 Conversion Effort, 1.2 Testing Effort, 1.3 Total Estimated Effort, 1.4 Recommendation, 2. API Usage & Cost. Same hierarchical breakdown, bullet point formatting, and logical flow. Only minor formatting differences in backticks usage and currency symbol placement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,98,"Lines 1-22","Excellent syntactic correctness. Proper markdown formatting, consistent bullet points, valid mathematical calculations (8+16+12+4=40 base hours, 56 total with testing, $56*50=$2800). Minor formatting inconsistency with backticks around some values but not others."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,96,"Lines 1-22","Good syntactic correctness with proper structure and formatting. Mathematical calculations are valid (8+20+6+6=40 base hours, 56 total, $56*$65=$3640). Minor issues: inconsistent currency formatting ($56 * $65 vs standard notation), and slight formatting variations in bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"Lines 1-22 (Both)","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown structure, consistent internal formatting, and valid mathematical calculations. Minor formatting inconsistencies in both outputs but no syntax errors or broken references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,90,"Lines 13-16","Strong technical reasoning for refactoring approach. Clear cost-benefit analysis with specific hourly rates. Consider standardizing formatting (consistent backtick usage) and providing more detailed complexity justification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,88,"Lines 13-16","Comprehensive technical justification with specific PySpark mapping details. Good analysis of complexity factors. Improve currency formatting consistency and consider providing more granular cost breakdown for different skill levels."
