Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to placeholder variables in input. Agent outputs appear as template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} rather than actual content. This indicates the inputs were not properly resolved before analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as actual agent outputs are not available. Input contains unresolved template variables instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity as actual agent outputs are not available. Input contains unresolved template variables instead of content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 as actual output is not available. Input contains unresolved template variable {{agent 1_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 as actual output is not available. Input contains unresolved template variable {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score is 0 due to inability to access actual agent outputs for analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Ensure agent outputs are properly resolved before comparison analysis. 2. Verify template variable substitution is working correctly. 3. Provide actual agent output content instead of placeholder variables. 4. Re-run comparison once actual outputs are available."
