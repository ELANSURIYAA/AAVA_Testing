Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-23 (Agent_1), Lines 1-23 (Agent_2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical structure but different specific values and reasoning depth. Agent_1 provides concise estimates while Agent_2 offers more detailed justification for recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-23","Both outputs address identical conversion estimation goals with same intent and purpose. Differences exist in specific hour allocations (Agent_1: Complex Transformations 16h vs Agent_2: 20h, Job Control 12h vs Agent_2: 6h) and cost calculations (Agent_1: $50/hr = $2800 vs Agent_2: $65/hr = $3640). Reasoning depth varies significantly in section 1.4 where Agent_2 provides more comprehensive justification."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-23","Nearly identical structure with sections 1.1-1.4 and section 2. Both follow same logical flow: conversion effort breakdown, testing effort, total calculation, recommendation, and API cost. Minor formatting differences in hour presentation (Agent_1 uses backticks, Agent_2 uses plain text)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,"Lines 1-23","Syntactically correct markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, valid mathematical calculations (8+16+12+4+10+6=56 hours, 56*50=2800), proper section numbering and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-23","Syntactically correct markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, valid mathematical calculations (8+20+6+6+8+8=56 hours, 56*65=3640), proper section numbering and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-23","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown structure and accurate calculations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 15-17","Strengthen recommendation rationale by providing more detailed justification for refactor vs rebuild decision, similar to Agent_2's comprehensive reasoning approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 15-19","Maintain the comprehensive reasoning approach while ensuring hour allocations align with complexity assessments for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-23","Both outputs would benefit from standardized hourly rates and more detailed breakdown of API cost calculation methodology."
