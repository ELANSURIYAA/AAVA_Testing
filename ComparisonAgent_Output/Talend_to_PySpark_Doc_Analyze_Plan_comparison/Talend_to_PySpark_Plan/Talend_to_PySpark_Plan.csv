Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Two effort estimation outputs for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical total hours (56) but different cost calculations and component-level hour distributions. Both recommend refactoring approach with similar reasoning but different hourly rates and API costs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs address the same core goal of estimating Talend to PySpark conversion effort. They share identical total hours (56) and refactor recommendation, but differ in component-level distributions and cost calculations. The semantic intent and purpose are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-25,"Nearly identical structure with same sections: 1.1 Conversion Effort, 1.2 Testing Effort, 1.3 Total Estimated Effort, 1.4 Recommendation, and 2. API Usage & Cost. Both follow the same logical flow and organization pattern."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,100,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations ($56 * 50 = $2800), and well-formed structure. No syntax errors or internal inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,100,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations ($56 * $65 = $3640), and well-formed structure. No syntax errors or internal inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct with no formatting errors, broken references, or mathematical inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,Lines 4-8,"Consider standardizing component hour estimates with Output2 for consistency across similar conversion projects."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,Lines 4-8,"Verify the higher hourly rate ($65 vs $50) aligns with current market rates and project budget constraints."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs provide solid estimation frameworks. Consider creating a standardized template that combines the strengths of both approaches for future Talend to PySpark conversion estimates."
