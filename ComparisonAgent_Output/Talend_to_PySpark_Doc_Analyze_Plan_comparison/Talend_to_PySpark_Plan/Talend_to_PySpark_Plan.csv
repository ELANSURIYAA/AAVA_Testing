Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs provide comprehensive effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical structure and total hours (56). Key differences include hourly rates ($50 vs $65), individual component hour allocations, and API costs (0.0173 vs 0.0630 USD). Semantic alignment is strong with both recommending refactor approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs address identical goal of effort estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion. Same refactor recommendation with similar reasoning. Minor differences in emphasis on specific conversion challenges and cost justification approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-25","Nearly identical structure: 1.1 Conversion Effort, 1.2 Testing Effort, 1.3 Total Estimated Effort, 1.4 Recommendation, 2. API Usage & Cost. Same markdown formatting, bullet points, and section organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 3-7, 10-11, 15-16","Syntactically correct markdown. Minor formatting inconsistency with backticks around hours values (e.g., '8' hours) which is non-standard but valid."
