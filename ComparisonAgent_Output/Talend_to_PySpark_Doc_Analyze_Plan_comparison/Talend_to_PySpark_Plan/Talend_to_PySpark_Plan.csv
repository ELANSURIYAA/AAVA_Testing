Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,Lines 1-30,"Both outputs provide comprehensive effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical total hours (56) but different hourly rates ($50 vs $65) and component-level hour allocations. Semantic similarity is high (85/100) as both address the same conversion task with similar methodology. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with identical section organization and flow. Correctness is perfect (100/100) for both outputs with valid syntax and consistent internal references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 3-7 and 15-19,"Both outputs estimate conversion effort for identical component types with same total hours (56) but different distributions. Agent 1 allocates more hours to Job Control (12 vs 6) and less to Complex Transformations (16 vs 20). Both recommend refactoring over rebuilding with similar reasoning about moderate complexity and reusable logic. Different hourly rates ($50 vs $65) result in different total costs ($2800 vs $3640)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-30,"Nearly identical structure with same section hierarchy: 1.1 Conversion Effort, 1.2 Testing Effort, 1.3 Total Estimated Effort, 1.4 Recommendation, and 2. API Usage & Cost. Both use consistent markdown formatting with bullet points and bold headers. Only minor formatting differences in cost calculation presentation (backticks vs no backticks)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-30,"Perfect syntax with consistent markdown formatting, valid mathematical calculations ($56 * 50 = $2800), proper section numbering, and coherent internal references. All component hour estimates sum correctly to total."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-30,"Perfect syntax with consistent markdown formatting, valid mathematical calculations ($56 * $65 = $3640), proper section numbering, and coherent internal references. All component hour estimates sum correctly to total."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-30,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown structure, accurate mathematical calculations, and consistent internal formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-19,"Consider validating the lower hourly rate ($50) against current market rates for PySpark developers to ensure realistic cost estimation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 15-19,"The higher hourly rate ($65) appears more aligned with current market rates for senior PySpark developers. Consider providing more detailed justification for the specific hour allocations per component type."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 20-30,"Both outputs would benefit from including risk factors, timeline considerations, and potential cost variations based on team experience levels. Consider adding confidence intervals for effort estimates."
