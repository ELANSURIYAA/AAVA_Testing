Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs provide effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical structure and total hours (56) but differ in hourly rates ($50 vs $65), individual component estimates, and API costs. High semantic and structural similarity with minor correctness variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Talend to PySpark conversion effort. They follow identical logical flow: conversion effort breakdown, testing effort, total calculation, refactor recommendation, and API cost. The semantic intent and purpose are nearly identical, with only minor differences in reasoning details for the refactor recommendation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-25","Nearly identical structural organization with matching section headers (1.1-1.4, 2), same subsection breakdown, identical formatting patterns, and consistent flow from component-level estimates to totals to recommendations. Only minor formatting differences in currency notation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,100,"Lines 1-25","Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations are correct (8+16+12+4+10+6=56, $56*50=$2800). No formatting errors, consistent notation, and all references are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,"Lines 1-25","Perfect syntax and internal consistency. All mathematical calculations are correct (8+20+6+6+8+8=56, $56*65=$3640). No formatting errors, consistent notation, and all references are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with accurate calculations, consistent formatting, and proper structure. No syntax errors or internal inconsistencies detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Lines 13-14","Provides clear refactor recommendation with moderate complexity reasoning. Consider adding more detailed justification for the complexity assessment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Lines 13-14","Offers more comprehensive refactor justification with specific technical reasoning about DataFrame operations and error management. More detailed analysis of conversion requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-25","Both outputs provide solid refactor recommendations. Output_2 offers more technical depth in justification. Consider standardizing hourly rates and component estimation methodologies for consistency across similar assessments."
