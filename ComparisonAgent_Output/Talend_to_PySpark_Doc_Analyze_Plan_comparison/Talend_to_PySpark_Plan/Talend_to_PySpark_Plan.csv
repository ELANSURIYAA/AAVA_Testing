Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-22 (Agent 1), Lines 1-22 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion. They follow identical structural organization with sections for conversion effort, testing effort, total estimation, and recommendations. Key differences include hourly rates ($50 vs $65), specific hour allocations for component types, and API costs. Both recommend refactoring over rebuilding but with different justifications."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-22 (Agent 1), Lines 1-22 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Talend to PySpark conversion effort. They share the same high-level approach of breaking down effort by component type, including testing phases, and providing refactor vs rebuild recommendations. Minor semantic differences exist in the reasoning for refactoring recommendation and emphasis on different complexity aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-22 (Agent 1), Lines 1-22 (Agent 2)","Nearly identical structural organization with matching section headers (1.1-1.4, 2), consistent formatting patterns, and parallel information hierarchy. Both follow the same logical flow from component-level effort estimation to total cost calculation to strategic recommendation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-22,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations ($56 * 50 = $2800), valid numeric values, and well-formed structure. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-22,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations ($56 * $65 = $3640), valid numeric values, and well-formed structure. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, mathematical inconsistencies, or structural issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 15-17,"Maintain the clear component-type breakdown approach while considering standardizing hourly rates across similar estimation exercises for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 15-17,"The more detailed justification for refactoring decision provides better stakeholder confidence. Consider adopting this level of technical reasoning detail."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-22,"Both outputs provide solid estimation frameworks. Consider creating a standardized template that combines Agent_1's cost efficiency with Agent_2's detailed technical justification for optimal estimation reports."
