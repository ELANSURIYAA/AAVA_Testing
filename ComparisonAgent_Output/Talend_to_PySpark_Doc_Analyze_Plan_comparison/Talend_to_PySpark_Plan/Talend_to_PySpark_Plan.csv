Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs provide comprehensive effort and cost estimation for Talend to PySpark conversion with identical structural organization but different quantitative values and reasoning depth. Output1 estimates $2800 total cost while Output2 estimates $3640. Both recommend refactoring approach but Output2 provides more detailed technical justification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs address identical goals of effort estimation and cost analysis for Talend to PySpark conversion. They share the same fundamental intent and approach but differ in specific hour allocations and cost calculations. Output2 provides more comprehensive reasoning for the refactor recommendation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-25,"Nearly identical structural organization with matching section hierarchy: 1.1 Conversion Effort, 1.2 Testing Effort, 1.3 Total Estimated Effort, 1.4 Recommendation, and 2. API Usage & Cost. Both follow the same logical flow and decomposition approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,100,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations (8+16+12+4+10+6=56 hours, $56*50=$2800), valid structure, and no formatting errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,100,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent mathematical calculations (8+20+6+6+8+8=56 hours, $56*65=$3640), valid structure, and no formatting errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown formatting and accurate mathematical calculations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,N/A,Lines 18-20,"Consider expanding the refactor reasoning section to provide more technical justification similar to Output2's approach for better stakeholder understanding."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,N/A,Lines 18-23,"Excellent detailed reasoning for refactor recommendation. Consider standardizing hour rate ($65 vs $50) for consistency with organizational standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for project planning. Consider creating a hybrid approach combining Output1's concise format with Output2's detailed technical reasoning for optimal stakeholder communication."
