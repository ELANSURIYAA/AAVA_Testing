Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - actual agent outputs not provided. Only placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were received. Please provide the actual content from both agents to enable systematic comparison across semantic, structural, and correctness dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires analysis of intent, meaning, and purpose alignment between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Requires analysis of logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent output content instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Include any relevant metadata or context about the outputs. 4. Specify the expected output type (code, documentation, analysis report, test cases) if not evident from content."
