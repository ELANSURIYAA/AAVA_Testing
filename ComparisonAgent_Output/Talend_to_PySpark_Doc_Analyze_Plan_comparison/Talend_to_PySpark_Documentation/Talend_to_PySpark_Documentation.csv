Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the AI_POC_Postgre Talend job, covering business objectives, technical architecture, and PySpark conversion requirements. Agent 1 provides a well-structured business-focused analysis, while Agent 2 offers more granular technical details with specific Java code references. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of ETL processes and conversion complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting Talend ETL job for employee data processing from PostgreSQL. Both identify same business problems (aggregation, normalization, salary enrichment), same data flow (tDBInput → tAggregateRow → tNormalize → tMap → tFileOutputDelimited), and same conversion challenges. Minor differences in business vs technical emphasis. Agent 1 focuses more on enterprise support aspects, Agent 2 provides deeper technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-10, 20-30, 40-50","Both follow nearly identical 10-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Agent 2 includes additional subsections like 'Complexity Metrics Table' and more detailed technical breakdowns. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Agent 1 uses more bullet points, Agent 2 uses more tables and technical specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,98,"Lines 15, 45, 78","Well-structured documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: inconsistent bullet point formatting in lines 15-20, missing line breaks in data mapping table around line 45, and slight inconsistency in section numbering format. Technical content is accurate and comprehensive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 25, 67, 89, 120","Comprehensive technical documentation with detailed code references. Issues include: redundant 'Complexity Metrics Table' section that duplicates information from main complexity analysis (lines 120-130), inconsistent formatting in technical specifications around line 67, and some overly verbose explanations that could be more concise. Java code references are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy and comprehensive coverage. Agent 1 provides cleaner formatting with minor structural issues. Agent 2 offers more technical depth but with some redundancy and formatting inconsistencies. Overall correctness is very high for both agents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Improve bullet point consistency and section formatting. Consider adding more technical implementation details similar to Agent 2's approach. Enhance data mapping section with more specific field transformation examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Remove redundant sections and consolidate complexity metrics. Improve formatting consistency throughout document. Consider more concise explanations while maintaining technical depth. Add executive summary section for better business context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide excellent foundation for Talend to PySpark conversion. Consider combining Agent 1's business clarity with Agent 2's technical depth for optimal documentation. Both agents correctly identify moderate conversion complexity (55-70/100) and provide actionable PySpark migration strategies."
