Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"No agent outputs provided for comparison. Input contains placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} but no actual content to analyze. Unable to perform semantic structural or correctness evaluation without real agent outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Input contains only placeholder variables rather than substantive content to compare."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No logical structure flow or decomposition to analyze."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent output evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Replace placeholder variables with actual agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Ensure both agents receive identical input instructions for fair evaluation across semantic structural and correctness dimensions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide content type context (code documentation analysis report test cases) to apply appropriate validation standards."
