Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-162920","Both agents provide comprehensive documentation analysis of a Talend ETL job converting employee data from PostgreSQL. AI_POC_Postgre focuses on high-level business context and component overview, while data_transform_pipeline provides deeper technical implementation details including specific Talend component names, Java code structure, and detailed complexity metrics. Both address the same core ETL pipeline with aggregation, normalization, and joining operations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs address the same Talend job analysis with identical business objectives: processing employee data through aggregation by manager, normalization, and salary enrichment. Core transformations and data flow are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in emphasis - AI_POC_Postgre focuses more on business context while data_transform_pipeline emphasizes technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-10, 50-60, 100-110","Both follow nearly identical 10-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. data_transform_pipeline includes additional subsections and more detailed technical breakdowns, but maintains the same logical flow and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AI_POC_Postgre,95,"Lines 15, 45, 78","Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issue: some placeholder text 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears to be corrupted but doesn't affect overall correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,data_transform_pipeline,98,"Lines 25, 67, 145","Highly accurate technical documentation with specific Talend component names, proper Java references, and detailed complexity metrics. Excellent technical precision with specific line counts (162,920 characters), component mappings, and implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both provide technically accurate and well-structured documentation with minor formatting issues in AI_POC_Postgre."
