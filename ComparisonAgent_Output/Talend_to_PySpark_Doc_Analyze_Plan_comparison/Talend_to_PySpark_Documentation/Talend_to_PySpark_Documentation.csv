Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for a Talend ETL job conversion to PySpark. Agent_1 delivers a concise 162920-character structured analysis covering all essential aspects. Agent_2 provides a more detailed 5000+ line analysis with enhanced technical depth and complexity metrics. Both address the same business problem of employee data processing with aggregation, normalization, and enrichment workflows."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: documenting a Talend job that processes employee data from PostgreSQL, performs aggregation by manager, normalization, and salary enrichment. Core semantic elements align: ETL pipeline purpose, data transformations, and output generation. Minor differences in emphasis - Agent_1 focuses on enterprise support aspects while Agent_2 emphasizes technical implementation details. Both correctly identify the same data flow and business rules."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 10-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Agent_2 includes additional subsections and more detailed complexity metrics table. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Both use similar formatting patterns with numbered sections, bullet points, and tables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-50,"Well-structured documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: Some repetitive phrasing in sections 1-2. Data mapping table is complete and accurate. All technical references are valid. Complexity analysis provides specific metrics (162920 lines, 2 tables, 1 join)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-100,"Highly detailed and technically accurate documentation. Excellent use of tables for complexity metrics. Comprehensive coverage of conversion considerations. Minor formatting inconsistency in the final sections. All technical details are precise and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, valid technical references, and consistent internal formatting. Agent_2 shows slightly better organization and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-20,"Enhance technical depth in complexity analysis section. Add more specific metrics for performance optimization strategies. Consider expanding the conversion complexity discussion with more detailed PySpark mapping examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 80-100,"Maintain the excellent level of technical detail. Consider consolidating some redundant information in the final sections. The comprehensive approach with detailed tables and metrics is highly valuable for technical audiences."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide solid documentation foundation. Agent_2's approach with detailed complexity tables and comprehensive technical analysis serves as the stronger reference. Consider combining Agent_1's concise enterprise focus with Agent_2's technical depth for optimal documentation."
