Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the same Talend ETL job (AI_POC_Postgre) for migration to PySpark. They share identical job overview, similar complexity assessments, and comparable migration recommendations. Key differences include structural organization, level of technical detail, and specific complexity scoring approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing a Talend job for PySpark migration. They identify identical components (tDBInput, tAggregateRow, tNormalize, tMap, tFileOutputDelimited), similar migration challenges (Talend routines, Java constructs, context variables), and comparable optimization recommendations. Minor semantic differences include Agent_1's focus on 'enterprise ETL needs' vs Agent_2's emphasis on 'manager-wise employee roster'. Both conclude with refactor recommendations over rebuild."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar section-based structure with numbered headings (1. Job Overview, 2. Complexity Metrics, etc.). However, Agent_1 uses 6 main sections while Agent_2 uses 7 sections including an additional 'Syntax Differences' section (lines 25-35). Agent_2 provides more granular breakdown with subsections and additional technical details. Both conclude with API cost information but Agent_2 includes more detailed complexity scoring rationale."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 10-15,"Minor inconsistency in line count reporting (162920 vs actual content length). All technical details about Talend components and PySpark migration concepts are accurate. Migration complexity score of 70/100 is well-justified with clear rationale."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 15-20,"Character count inconsistency (claims ~5000+ lines but shows 162920 characters). Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity score presentation. All technical analysis is accurate and comprehensive with detailed component mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minor reporting inconsistencies. Agent_1 has better consistency in metrics reporting while Agent_2 provides more comprehensive technical detail coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 40-45,"Maintain the clear executive summary format and concise complexity scoring. Consider adding more technical detail about syntax differences and component mapping to match the comprehensiveness of the comparison output."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 25-35,"Excellent addition of the 'Syntax Differences' section provides valuable technical insight. Consider improving consistency in metrics reporting and formatting. The detailed component analysis is a strong differentiator."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized metrics reporting format and consistent line/character count methodology. Consider combining Agent_1's clarity with Agent_2's technical depth for optimal analysis coverage."
