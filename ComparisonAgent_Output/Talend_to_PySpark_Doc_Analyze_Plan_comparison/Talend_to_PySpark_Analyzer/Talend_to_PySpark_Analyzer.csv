Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-162920 vs Lines 1-5000+","Both agents provide comprehensive Talend to PySpark migration analysis with job overviews, complexity metrics, and recommendations. Agent_1 focuses on high-level migration strategy while Agent_2 provides more granular technical details including syntax differences and specific component mappings."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-30","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Talend ETL job migration to PySpark. They share similar understanding of the migration challenges, complexity assessment, and optimization strategies. Minor differences in emphasis and detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-162920 vs Lines 1-5000+","Both follow similar analytical structure with job overview, complexity metrics, challenges, and recommendations. Agent_2 includes additional sections like 'Syntax Differences' and more detailed component analysis. Overall flow is consistent but Agent_2 has more granular organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 51-100","Technical accuracy is high with valid complexity scoring (70/100), appropriate component identification, and sound migration recommendations. Minor issue: Line count discrepancy (162920 lines vs actual content suggests character count confusion)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 31-80","Good technical accuracy with detailed component analysis and appropriate complexity scoring (55/100). Some inconsistencies in line count reporting (~5000+ vs 162920 characters) and minor formatting variations in section headers."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with minor formatting and measurement inconsistencies."
