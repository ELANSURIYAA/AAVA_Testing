Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive analyses of the AI_POC_Postgre Talend job for PySpark migration. Talend_Migration_Analyzer focuses on migration complexity with a 70/100 score, while Talend_Detail_Analyzer provides more technical depth with a 55/100 complexity score. Both identify key challenges including Talend-specific routines, Java constructs, and context variables. The outputs are semantically aligned (85/100) with similar structural approaches (88/100) and both demonstrate high correctness (95/100 average)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-60","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Talend job migration to PySpark. Key semantic alignments include: job purpose identification, complexity assessment, migration challenges, and optimization recommendations. Differences: Talend_Migration_Analyzer emphasizes migration complexity scoring (70/100), while Talend_Detail_Analyzer focuses on conversion complexity (55/100) and includes syntax differences analysis. Both reach similar conclusions about refactoring approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Section headers 1-7 vs 1-6","Both follow numbered section structure with logical flow: Job Overview → Complexity Metrics → Challenges → Recommendations. Talend_Migration_Analyzer uses 7 sections including API Cost, while Talend_Detail_Analyzer uses 6 sections with additional Syntax Differences section. Both maintain consistent formatting with markdown headers, bullet points, and structured data presentation. Minor differences in section ordering and emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Talend_Migration_Analyzer,95,"Lines 1-50","Output demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering (1-7), valid bullet points, and no broken internal references. All metrics are properly formatted (162920 lines, 70/100 score). Minor issue: API cost format could be more standardized. All technical terms and component names are correctly referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Talend_Detail_Analyzer,95,"Lines 1-60","Output shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown structure, consistent section numbering (1-6), and valid formatting throughout. All technical details are accurately presented (~5,000+ lines, 55/100 score). Component names (tDBInput_1, tMap_1, etc.) are correctly formatted. All internal references are consistent and valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent structure, and valid internal references. Average score reflects excellent technical documentation standards with minor formatting variations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Talend_Migration_Analyzer,,"Lines 45-50","Strengthen technical depth by adding syntax difference analysis similar to Talend_Detail_Analyzer. Consider standardizing API cost reporting format. Maintain current migration complexity scoring approach as it provides clear assessment framework."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Talend_Detail_Analyzer,,"Lines 55-60","Excellent technical detail and component mapping. Consider adding explicit migration complexity scoring framework similar to Talend_Migration_Analyzer. The syntax differences section adds significant value for technical teams."
