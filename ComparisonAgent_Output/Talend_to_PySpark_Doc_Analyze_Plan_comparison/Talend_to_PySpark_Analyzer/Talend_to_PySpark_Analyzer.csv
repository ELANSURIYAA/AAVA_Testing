Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive Talend to PySpark migration analysis for the AI_POC_Postgre job. Agent 1 offers a structured overview with clear sections and scoring (70/100 complexity). Agent 2 provides more technical depth with detailed syntax differences and component mapping. Both identify key migration challenges including Talend-specific routines, Java constructs, and nested transformations. The outputs are semantically aligned but structurally different in presentation and level of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs analyze the same Talend job (AI_POC_Postgre) with consistent understanding of the core ETL process: reading employee data from PostgreSQL, performing aggregation by manager, normalization, joining with salary data, and outputting to delimited file. Both identify similar migration challenges (Talend routines, Java constructs, context variables) and recommend similar PySpark optimizations (broadcast joins, caching, DataFrame APIs). Minor differences in emphasis and technical depth but overall semantic alignment is strong."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,All,"Agent 1 follows a numbered section structure (1-7) with clear headings: Job Overview, Complexity Metrics, Migration Challenges, Manual Adjustments, Migration Complexity Score, Optimization Recommendations, API Cost. Agent 2 uses similar numbered sections (1-6) but includes additional 'Syntax Differences' section and more detailed technical breakdowns. Both maintain logical flow from overview to complexity analysis to recommendations, but Agent 2 provides more granular technical details within each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-50,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, accurate technical terminology, and valid complexity scoring (70/100). All component names (tDBInput, tAggregateRow, tNormalize, tMap, tFileOutputDelimited) are correctly referenced. API cost notation is properly formatted. Minor issue: Line count of 162920 seems inconsistent with typical Talend job size."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 1-60,"Agent 2 output is well-structured with proper markdown formatting and accurate technical details. Component names and counts are consistent. However, there's an inconsistency in line count reporting (~5,000+ vs 162,920 characters) in lines 15-16. Conversion complexity score (55/100) is properly justified. All technical recommendations are syntactically sound and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate technical terminology, and consistent internal references. Minor inconsistencies in metrics reporting but overall both outputs are technically sound and internally consistent."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,90,Lines 40-50,"Agent 1 provides clear, actionable recommendations with specific PySpark optimization techniques. Recommend enhancing with more detailed syntax mapping examples and specific code transformation patterns to improve practical utility for migration teams."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,92,Lines 45-60,"Agent 2 offers comprehensive recommendations with detailed syntax differences and specific PySpark alternatives. The refactor vs rebuild analysis is particularly valuable. Recommend consolidating the technical details into more digestible action items for implementation teams."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,91,All,"Both outputs provide valuable migration guidance. Agent 1 excels in clear structure and scoring methodology. Agent 2 provides superior technical depth and syntax mapping. For optimal results, combine Agent 1's structured approach with Agent 2's technical detail level. Both correctly identify key migration challenges and provide appropriate PySpark optimization strategies."
