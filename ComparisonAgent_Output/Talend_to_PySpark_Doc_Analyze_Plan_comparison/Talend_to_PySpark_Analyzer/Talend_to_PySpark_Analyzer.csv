Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents provide comprehensive Talend to PySpark migration analysis with high semantic alignment (85/100) and strong structural similarity (78/100). Agent 1 focuses on migration challenges and complexity scoring, while Agent 2 emphasizes syntax differences and conversion methodology. Both outputs demonstrate excellent correctness with proper formatting and complete analysis coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 both agents,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing Talend job complexity and providing PySpark migration guidance. Agent 1 emphasizes migration challenges and optimization recommendations (lines 25-35), while Agent 2 focuses on syntax differences and conversion methodology (lines 20-30). Both conclude with similar complexity scores (70/100 vs 55/100) and refactor recommendations, showing strong semantic alignment despite different analytical approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-7 section headers,"Both agents follow similar 6-7 section structure: Job Overview, Complexity Metrics, Migration/Syntax Analysis, Manual Adjustments, Complexity Scoring, and Optimization Recommendations. Agent 1 uses 'Migration Challenges' (line 15) while Agent 2 uses 'Syntax Differences' (line 18). Both include API cost reporting. Section ordering and logical flow are nearly identical with minor variations in subsection emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Line 8 metrics formatting,"Excellent formatting and structure. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity metrics presentation (line 8) where bullet points could be more uniform. All sections are complete and well-organized. No syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,Lines 12-15 metrics format,"Strong overall correctness with comprehensive analysis. Minor inconsistencies in metrics formatting (lines 12-15) where some numbers include approximations (~5,000+ vs exact counts). Character count formatting could be more precise. All sections complete with proper structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper document structure, complete analysis coverage, and accurate technical content. Minor formatting variations do not impact overall quality or usability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Strengthen metrics presentation formatting for consistency. Consider adding more specific line counts and component details to match industry standards for migration documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Improve numerical precision in complexity metrics. Replace approximations with exact counts where possible. Standardize formatting of technical specifications for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable Talend to PySpark migration analysis. Consider combining Agent 1's detailed migration challenges with Agent 2's comprehensive syntax mapping approach for optimal migration planning documentation."
