Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50 vs 1-60,"Both outputs analyze the same Talend job AI_POC_Postgre for migration to PySpark. Output_1 provides a structured 7-section analysis with clear metrics and recommendations. Output_2 offers more detailed technical analysis with specific component mappings and syntax differences. Both identify similar complexity levels (70/100 vs 55/100) and recommend refactoring approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-10 vs 1-5,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing a Talend ETL job for PySpark migration. They identify identical components (tDBInput tAggregateRow tNormalize tMap tFileOutputDelimited) and similar transformation patterns. Minor differences in emphasis: Output_1 focuses on enterprise ETL context while Output_2 emphasizes technical component mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 11-30 vs 15-35,"Both follow logical analysis structure but with different organization. Output_1 uses 7 numbered sections (Job Overview Complexity Metrics Migration Challenges Manual Adjustments Migration Score Optimization Recommendations API Cost). Output_2 uses 6 sections with more technical depth in syntax differences and conversion complexity. Both conclude with optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 15-25,"Well-formed structure with consistent formatting. Minor issue: Line count 162920 appears inflated for typical Talend job. All technical terms and component names are accurate. Complexity score methodology is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,92,Lines 20-40,"Comprehensive technical analysis with accurate component mappings. Minor inconsistency: Character count ~5000+ contradicts line count claim. Syntax difference enumeration is thorough and technically accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor metric inconsistencies. Component identification transformation mapping and migration recommendations are technically sound in both cases."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,Lines 40-50,"Strengthen metric validation methodology. Provide more specific PySpark code examples for complex transformations. Consider adding estimated migration timeline."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 45-60,"Resolve metric inconsistencies between character and line counts. Expand on specific Python library alternatives for Talend routines. Add more concrete migration effort estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs provide valuable migration analysis. Output_1 excels in executive summary and business context. Output_2 provides superior technical depth. Consider combining approaches: use Output_1 structure with Output_2 technical detail level."
