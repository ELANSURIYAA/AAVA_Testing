Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-162920 vs 1-5000+,"Both agents provide comprehensive Talend to PySpark migration analysis with similar core insights. Agent_1 focuses on high-level migration challenges and optimization recommendations with a complexity score of 70/100. Agent_2 provides more granular technical details including syntax differences and component mappings with a complexity score of 55/100. Both identify key transformation components (tDBInput, tAggregateRow, tNormalize, tMap, tFileOutputDelimited) and similar migration challenges around Talend-specific routines and Java constructs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 both agents,"Both outputs address the identical core objective of analyzing Talend job AI_POC_Postgre for PySpark migration. They identify the same primary components and transformations, with both recognizing aggregation, normalization, and join operations. Key semantic alignment includes: (1) Both identify PostgreSQL as input source, (2) Both recognize the same core Talend components, (3) Both highlight Talend-specific routine migration challenges, (4) Both recommend refactoring approach over complete rebuild. Minor semantic differences include Agent_2 providing more granular component count (10 vs 5) and different complexity scoring rationale."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-100 both agents,"Both outputs follow similar structural organization with job overview, complexity metrics, challenges/adjustments, scoring, and recommendations sections. Agent_1 uses 7 main sections while Agent_2 uses 6 sections plus API cost. Structural alignment includes: (1) Both start with job overview, (2) Both include numbered complexity metrics, (3) Both provide migration challenges/syntax differences, (4) Both conclude with recommendations. Key structural difference is Agent_2 includes dedicated 'Syntax Differences' section (lines 45-65) while Agent_1 integrates this into 'Migration Challenges'. Agent_2 also provides more detailed component breakdown and character count metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-162920,"Agent_1 output demonstrates high syntactic correctness with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, and coherent internal references. Minor issues include: (1) Line count of 162920 seems inconsistent with actual content length, (2) Some bullet points could benefit from more consistent formatting. All technical terms are used correctly, component names are accurate, and the complexity score rationale is well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 1-5000+,"Agent_2 output shows strong syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section structure, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues include: (1) Character count notation (~5,000+ lines with 162,920 characters) creates some confusion about actual length, (2) Some inconsistent formatting in component lists. All Talend component names are correctly referenced, and the technical analysis is internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and consistent internal structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies and length reporting discrepancies in both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 80-100,"Agent_1 provides solid high-level migration guidance but could benefit from more granular technical details about specific component mappings and syntax transformations that Agent_2 provides."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 70-90,"Agent_2 offers excellent technical depth and component-level analysis but could improve by providing clearer complexity scoring rationale and more structured optimization recommendations like Agent_1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both agents should standardize their length reporting methodology and ensure consistency between stated line counts and actual content. Consider combining Agent_1's strategic recommendations with Agent_2's technical granularity for optimal migration planning."
