Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All lines,"Both agents provide comprehensive Talend to PySpark migration analysis for the AI_POC_Postgre job. Agent_2_Output delivers more detailed technical breakdown with specific component counts and syntax differences, while Agent_1_Output provides cleaner structure with focused recommendations. Both identify key migration challenges including Talend-specific routines, Java constructs, and context variables. Semantic alignment is strong (88/100) with both addressing the same core migration requirements. Structural similarity is good (82/100) with similar section organization but different levels of detail. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and complete information."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the identical core objective of analyzing Talend job AI_POC_Postgre for PySpark migration. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both identify the same ETL pipeline components (tDBInput, tAggregateRow, tNormalize, tMap, tFileOutputDelimited), (2) Both recognize PostgreSQL as input source and delimited file as output, (3) Both highlight migration challenges with Talend-specific routines and Java constructs, (4) Both provide PySpark optimization recommendations including broadcast joins and DataFrame APIs. Minor semantic differences: Agent_2_Output provides more granular component count (10 vs 5) and includes console output target, while Agent_1_Output focuses on enterprise ETL context. Both conclude with refactor recommendations over rebuild."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-162920,"Both outputs follow similar 6-7 section structure: Job Overview, Complexity Metrics, Migration Challenges/Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Migration/Conversion Complexity, Optimization Recommendations. Structural alignments: (1) Both start with job overview and component identification, (2) Both include quantified complexity metrics, (3) Both detail migration challenges systematically, (4) Both conclude with optimization strategies and refactor recommendations. Key structural differences: Agent_2_Output includes dedicated 'Syntax Differences' section (lines 25-35) with numbered difference count, while Agent_1_Output integrates this into 'Migration Challenges'. Agent_2_Output provides more granular metrics (character count: 162,920) and detailed component breakdown. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,Lines 1-50,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness with: (1) Consistent markdown formatting throughout, (2) Proper section numbering and hierarchy, (3) Accurate technical terminology and component names, (4) Valid complexity score format (70/100), (5) Consistent bullet point formatting, (6) Proper API cost format (0.0125 USD), (7) No broken references or undefined terms, (8) Complete sentences and proper grammar throughout all sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,Lines 1-60,"Agent_2_Output exhibits perfect syntactic correctness with: (1) Proper markdown formatting with consistent section breaks (---), (2) Accurate technical component names and counts, (3) Valid complexity score format (55/100), (4) Consistent bullet point and numbering schemes, (5) Proper API cost format (0.0630 USD), (6) Complete technical specifications without undefined references, (7) Proper grammar and sentence structure, (8) Consistent formatting for metrics and recommendations throughout all sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs achieve perfect syntactic correctness. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100. No syntax errors, formatting issues, or structural problems detected in either output. Both maintain consistent technical documentation standards with proper markdown formatting, accurate component references, and complete information presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,90,Lines 40-50,"Strengths: Clean structure, focused enterprise context, clear migration complexity scoring (70/100), concise optimization recommendations. Areas for improvement: Could benefit from more detailed component breakdown and specific syntax difference enumeration like Agent_2_Output provides. The API cost reporting (0.0125 USD) suggests efficient processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,91,Lines 50-60,"Strengths: Comprehensive technical detail, specific component count (10), detailed syntax differences section, granular complexity analysis (55/100), thorough refactor vs rebuild analysis. Areas for improvement: Could streamline presentation for better readability while maintaining technical depth. The higher API cost (0.0630 USD) reflects more detailed analysis but delivers proportional value."
