# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents successfully converted Ab Initio DML files to PySpark StructType schemas. Agent 1 provides a comprehensive enterprise-ready module with extensive documentation, AWS Glue compatibility functions, and usage examples. Agent 2 delivers a minimal but functional implementation with basic schemas only. Core schema definitions are identical between both outputs.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address the same core goal of converting Ab Initio DML to PySpark schemas. All four schema definitions (enriched_schema, product_dimension_schema, raw_input_schema, summary_schema) are semantically identical with matching field names, data types, and nullability. The 5-point deduction reflects Agent 1's additional semantic layer of AWS Glue compatibility and enterprise documentation that Agent 2 lacks.

**Key Similarities:**
- Identical schema field definitions across all four schemas
- Same data type mappings (DecimalType, StringType, DateType)
- Consistent nullability settings (True for all fields)
- Same field naming conventions

**Differences:**
- Agent 1 includes AWS Glue compatibility functions (lines 52-75)
- Agent 1 provides comprehensive usage examples (lines 77-85)
- Agent 1 has detailed docstring documentation

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both follow the same basic structure of imports followed by schema definitions. However, Agent 1 uses extensive section separators (lines 13-17, 24-28, 35-39, 46-50), includes Glue compatibility functions (lines 52-75), and provides comprehensive usage examples (lines 77-85). Agent 2 uses minimal structure with basic comments only. Core schema blocks are structurally identical.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Both start with PySpark imports
- Schema definitions follow identical StructType patterns
- Variable naming is consistent between outputs

**Structural Differences:**
- Agent 1: 85 lines with comprehensive documentation blocks
- Agent 2: 42 lines with minimal comments
- Agent 1 includes helper functions for Glue compatibility
- Agent 1 provides extensive usage documentation

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 100/100):** Perfect syntax with valid Python imports, properly formatted StructType definitions, correct function definitions with docstrings, and syntactically valid usage examples. All variable references are defined, indentation is consistent, and code follows Python conventions.

**Agent 2 (Score: 100/100):** Perfect syntax with valid Python imports, properly formatted StructType definitions, consistent indentation, and all variable references are defined. Code follows Python conventions despite minimal structure.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 100/100):** Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no syntax errors, undefined variables, or formatting issues.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **90** | **90** | **90** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:** Excellent enterprise-ready implementation. Consider adding type hints for better IDE support and runtime validation. The comprehensive documentation and Glue compatibility make this production-ready.

**For Agent 2:** Functional but minimal implementation. Recommend adding: detailed documentation blocks, AWS Glue compatibility functions, usage examples, and consistent formatting with section separators to match enterprise standards.
