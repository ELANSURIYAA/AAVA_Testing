Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced Python scripts for Talend to PySpark migration validation with the same core objective: execute both Talend and PySpark jobs, compare their outputs, and generate reconciliation reports. Agent 2 demonstrates significantly more comprehensive implementation with enterprise-grade features including distributed storage support, enhanced security practices, robust error handling, and detailed documentation. While both scripts share the fundamental workflow structure, Agent 2 provides production-ready capabilities that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both scripts address the identical core objective of validating Talend to PySpark migration by executing jobs, converting outputs to Parquet, and performing data comparison. The semantic intent is highly aligned with both implementing the same logical workflow: job execution -> format conversion -> comparison -> reporting. Minor semantic differences exist in implementation approach and feature scope, but the fundamental purpose and methodology remain consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both scripts follow similar high-level structural patterns with main() functions orchestrating the workflow, separate functions for job execution, format conversion, and comparison. However, Agent 2 introduces additional structural complexity with configuration management (lines 32-45), distributed storage handling (lines 125-170), and enhanced comparison logic (lines 172-230). Agent 1 uses a more straightforward linear structure while Agent 2 employs a more modular, enterprise-oriented architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 35, 47, 89","Agent 1 has minor syntax issues: Line 35 uses undefined 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' variable name which appears to be a placeholder that wasn't properly replaced. Line 47 has the same issue in variable naming. Line 89 references the malformed variable name in dictionary key. These are naming/placeholder issues rather than fundamental syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 95, 200","Agent 2 has excellent syntax correctness with only minor issues: Line 95 has a typo in context parameter 'Useranme' instead of 'Username'. Line 200 could benefit from more explicit error handling in the comparison logic. Overall syntax is clean and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both scripts demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with only minor issues that don't affect core functionality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 35, 47, 89","Fix variable naming issues by replacing 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' placeholders with proper variable names like 'report'. Add input validation and error handling. Consider implementing configuration management and security best practices from Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Line 95","Fix typo in 'Useranme' parameter to 'Username'. Consider adding more granular error handling in the comparison function. The script is already well-architected for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts would benefit from unit tests, integration tests, and CI/CD pipeline integration. Consider standardizing on Agent 2's approach for production deployment due to its superior security, scalability, and maintainability features."
