Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-100 vs Lines 1-300","Two Python scripts for Talend to PySpark migration validation with significantly different approaches. Agent 1 provides a basic validation framework while Agent 2 delivers a production-ready automation solution with comprehensive features, security considerations, and enterprise-grade capabilities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-20, 25-45, 50-70","Both scripts address the same core goal of validating Talend to PySpark migration by executing both jobs and comparing outputs. However, Agent 2 extends far beyond basic validation to include distributed storage, advanced security, schema evolution handling, and production-ready features that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-100 vs Lines 1-300","Both follow similar high-level flow: execute Talend job, convert outputs, execute PySpark job, compare results. However, Agent 2 has significantly more sophisticated structure with comprehensive configuration management (lines 25-45), advanced utility functions (lines 80-200), and production pipeline architecture that Agent 1's simpler structure doesn't match."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 15, 35, 55, 75","Syntax is mostly correct but has several issues: undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing' used in multiple places (lines 55, 75, 85), hardcoded paths without validation, and basic error handling that may not catch all edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 50, 150, 200","Excellent syntax with comprehensive error handling, proper environment variable usage, and robust validation. Minor issues include potential import dependencies that may not be available in all environments (lines 50-60) and some complex logic that could benefit from additional validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 15, 35, 55","Fix undefined variable references to 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing', implement proper configuration management using environment variables, add comprehensive error handling and logging, and consider adding distributed storage support for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 50-60, 200-250","Excellent production-ready implementation. Consider adding dependency validation at startup, implementing retry logic for distributed storage operations, and adding more granular configuration options for different deployment environments."
