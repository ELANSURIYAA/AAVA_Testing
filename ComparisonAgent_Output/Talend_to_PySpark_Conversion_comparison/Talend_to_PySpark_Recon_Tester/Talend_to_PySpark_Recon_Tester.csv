Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two Python scripts for Talend to PySpark migration validation were compared. Agent 1 provides basic functionality with core validation features, while Agent 2 delivers enterprise-grade automation with comprehensive security, distributed storage support, and robust error handling. Agent 2 demonstrates superior implementation quality across all evaluation dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-100 (Agent 1), Lines 1-300 (Agent 2)","Both scripts address the same core objective of validating Talend to PySpark migration through job execution, output comparison, and reconciliation reporting. Agent 1 focuses on basic validation workflow while Agent 2 extends this with distributed storage integration, advanced security practices, and comprehensive error handling. The semantic intent is aligned but Agent 2 provides significantly broader scope and enterprise readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 15-45 (Agent 1), Lines 50-150 (Agent 2)","Both scripts follow similar high-level structure with main execution flow, utility functions, and error handling. However, Agent 2 demonstrates superior modular design with extensive configuration management (lines 25-50), comprehensive utility functions (lines 150-250), and well-organized pipeline structure. Agent 1 uses simpler linear approach while Agent 2 implements enterprise-grade architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,25,"Lines 32, 47, 62, 77, 92","Agent 1 contains critical syntax errors with invalid Python identifiers containing forward slashes (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt) which will cause NameError exceptions. Variable names like 'output_ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt_path' are syntactically invalid in Python."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 280-290","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent Python syntax adherence with proper variable naming, imports, and structure. Minor deduction for potential runtime dependencies that may not be available in all environments (boto3, azure-storage-file-datalake)."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Fix critical syntax errors by replacing invalid variable names containing forward slashes with valid Python identifiers. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms. Add security considerations for credential management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Excellent implementation overall. Consider adding fallback mechanisms for distributed storage dependencies. Add more granular error handling for specific failure scenarios. Include performance optimization for large dataset processing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Agent 2 represents the superior implementation for production use with its comprehensive feature set, security practices, and enterprise readiness. Agent 1 requires significant refactoring to address syntax errors and enhance functionality before deployment."
