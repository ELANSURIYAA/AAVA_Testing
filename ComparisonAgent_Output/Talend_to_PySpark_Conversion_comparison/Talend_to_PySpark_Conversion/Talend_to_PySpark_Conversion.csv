Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided inputs contain placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. To conduct a proper comparison, actual content from both agents is required including code, documentation, or other output types for semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Semantic analysis requires comparing meanings, intent, and purpose between two concrete outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Structural analysis requires comparing logical flow, decomposition, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Talend_to_PySpark_Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content from Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Talend_to_PySpark_Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual output content from Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure outputs include proper formatting and structure for accurate evaluation. 3. Include context about the conversion task (Talend to PySpark) to enable domain-specific validation. 4. Re-run analysis once concrete outputs are available."
