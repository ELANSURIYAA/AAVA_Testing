# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual agent outputs. To complete the comparison, actual agent outputs containing code, documentation, or other content must be provided.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison would analyze how closely the meanings, intent, and overall purpose of the two outputs align. This dimension would evaluate:
- Whether both outputs address the same inferred goal
- If they apply similar transformations or reasoning
- Whether conclusions or outcomes are aligned in meaning

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)

Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison would analyze logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches, including:
- Order of steps or stages
- Use of logical blocks (CTEs, functions, sections, phases)
- Control flow and decomposition approach
- Schema or component hierarchy

### Correctness

**Agent1:** N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output.

**Agent2:** N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output.

**Overall:** N/A/100 - Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

To complete this comparison analysis:

1. **Provide actual agent outputs** instead of placeholder variables
2. **Ensure outputs contain substantive content** (code, documentation, analysis, or test cases)
3. **Include any relevant context** about the task or requirements
4. **Specify the expected output type** if not apparent from content
