Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Delegation_Output provides a brief delegation message stating the task complexity requires coworker assistance, while Agent Test_Case_Document delivers a comprehensive testing solution with detailed test cases, Pytest scripts, and execution templates. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to the same requirement."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent outputs address completely different interpretations of the task. Delegation_Output focuses on task complexity and delegation (lines 1-8), while Test_Case_Document provides comprehensive test case implementation (lines 1-200+). Minimal semantic overlap as one avoids the task while the other fully implements it."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Completely different structural approaches. Delegation_Output uses simple narrative structure with delegation reasoning (lines 1-8). Test_Case_Document employs structured testing framework with test case tables, Pytest code blocks, and execution templates (lines 1-200+). No structural similarity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Delegation_Output,95,"Lines 1-8","Syntactically correct delegation message with proper formatting and clear reasoning. Minor deduction for not addressing the actual task requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Case_Document,90,"Lines 50-150","Well-structured test cases and Pytest code with proper syntax. Minor issues: some test assertions could be more robust (lines 80-90), and error handling tests may need refinement (lines 120-130)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Delegation_Output,,"Agent should directly address task requirements rather than delegating. Consider implementing at least basic test case structure or framework outline to demonstrate understanding of testing requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Case_Document,,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider enhancing error handling test cases (lines 120-130) and adding more robust assertions in boundary condition tests (lines 80-90). Include performance benchmarking setup for Talend vs PySpark comparison."
