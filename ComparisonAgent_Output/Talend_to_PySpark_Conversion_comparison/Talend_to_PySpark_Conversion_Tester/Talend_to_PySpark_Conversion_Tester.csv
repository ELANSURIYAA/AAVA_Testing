Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"The two outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to the same task. Delegation_Output provides a task delegation strategy citing complexity and efficiency concerns, while Test_Document_Output delivers a comprehensive technical solution with detailed test cases, Pytest scripts, and execution templates. The outputs show minimal semantic overlap (15/100) as they address different aspects of the problem space, completely different structural approaches (5/100), and varying levels of technical correctness (Delegation: 85/100, Test_Document: 95/100, Overall: 90/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Delegation_Output focuses on task management and delegation rationale (lines 1-8), while Test_Document_Output provides comprehensive technical implementation (lines 1-200+). Both acknowledge the complexity of Talend to PySpark conversion testing, but Delegation_Output treats it as a delegation decision while Test_Document_Output provides actual test cases, Pytest scripts, and validation logic. The semantic overlap is minimal as one is procedural delegation and the other is technical implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Delegation_Output follows a simple narrative structure with problem identification and delegation decision (lines 1-8). Test_Document_Output uses structured technical documentation with test case tables, Python code blocks, and execution templates (lines 1-200+). The structural approaches are completely different - one is prose delegation, the other is technical specification with code, tables, and structured sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Delegation_Output,85,"Lines 3-4, 6-7","Delegation syntax is mostly correct with proper task description and context provision. Minor issues: incomplete JSON structure in Action Input (line 3-4) and some redundant context repetition (lines 6-7). The delegation rationale is logically sound but lacks specific technical justification for why delegation is necessary."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Document_Output,95,"Lines 50-60, 120-130","Technical content is highly accurate with proper Pytest syntax, valid PySpark operations, and comprehensive test coverage. Minor issues: some test assertions could be more specific (lines 50-60) and error handling tests could include more edge cases (lines 120-130). Overall structure and implementation are technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective contexts, with Test_Document_Output showing higher technical precision."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Delegation_Output,,"Consider providing more specific technical justification for delegation decisions. Include preliminary analysis of requirements before delegating. Add structured handoff documentation with clear success criteria and deliverable specifications."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Document_Output,,"Enhance error handling test cases with more comprehensive edge case coverage. Add performance benchmarking tests with specific metrics and thresholds. Include integration test scenarios for end-to-end pipeline validation. Consider adding data quality validation tests for schema drift and data lineage verification."
