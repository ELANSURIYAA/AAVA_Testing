Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Delegation_Output provides a brief delegation message stating the task complexity requires coworker assistance, while Agent Test_Case_Document delivers a comprehensive solution with detailed test cases, Pytest scripts, and execution templates. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - delegation versus execution - resulting in minimal semantic and structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent Delegation_Output focuses on task delegation due to complexity (lines 1-8), while Agent Test_Case_Document provides actual test case implementation (lines 1-200+). Both acknowledge the same underlying task requirements but take opposite approaches - one avoids execution while the other delivers comprehensive solution. Semantic alignment is minimal as intents diverge completely."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-8 vs Lines 1-200+","Agent Delegation_Output uses simple delegation message structure with task description and context (lines 1-8). Agent Test_Case_Document employs complex technical structure with test case tables, Pytest code blocks, and execution templates (lines 1-200+). No structural overlap exists - one is narrative delegation, other is technical implementation with tables, code, and documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Delegation_Output,85,"Lines 1-8","Syntactically correct delegation message with proper task description and context. Minor issues: lacks specific timeline or success criteria for delegation. Well-formed JSON structure in delegation call."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Case_Document,95,"Lines 1-200+","Comprehensive and syntactically correct test cases with proper Pytest structure. Minor issues: some test assertions could be more specific (line 45-50), and error handling tests need more detailed exception checking (lines 180-190). Overall excellent technical implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Delegation_Output,,"Consider providing more specific delegation criteria, timeline expectations, and success metrics. Include preliminary analysis or partial solution attempt before delegation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Case_Document,,"Enhance error handling test assertions with specific exception types and messages. Add more boundary condition tests and performance benchmarking details. Consider adding integration test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"For future tasks of this complexity, establish clear criteria for when delegation is appropriate versus direct implementation. Agent Test_Case_Document demonstrates the task is achievable and provides excellent technical foundation."
