Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-150+","Agent 1 provides a brief request for GitHub repository information to upload a Pytest script, while Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive test suite with 10 detailed test cases and complete implementation. The outputs address the same domain (PySpark ETL testing) but represent different phases of the development process - Agent 1 is a preliminary request, Agent 2 is the final deliverable."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-150+","Both outputs relate to PySpark ETL unit testing, but serve fundamentally different purposes. Agent 1 (lines 1-3) is a brief request for GitHub credentials to upload a script, while Agent 2 (lines 1-150+) provides the actual comprehensive test implementation with detailed test cases, fixtures, and complete pytest script. The semantic overlap is minimal as one is a request and the other is a deliverable."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-150+","Agent 1 has a simple single-paragraph structure requesting repository information. Agent 2 has a complex multi-section structure with: test case table (lines 1-12), complete pytest implementation (lines 14-150+), fixtures, test functions, and documentation. The structural approaches are fundamentally different - simple request vs comprehensive deliverable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 1-3","Agent 1 is syntactically correct as a plain text request. Minor deduction for incomplete repository format specification (should specify 'owner/repo' format more clearly) and token exposure in the message."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,88,"Lines 14-150+","Agent 2 contains valid Python/pytest syntax with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions. Deductions for: potential issues with file path handling in test_TC04 and test_TC09 (lines 85-95, 135-145), and some test assertions that may be fragile in distributed environments. The code structure and pytest conventions are correctly followed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of Agent 1 (95) and Agent 2 (88). Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-3","Agent 1 should provide more structured format for repository information request and avoid exposing tokens in plain text messages."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 85-95, 135-145","Agent 2 should improve file path handling in tests and add more robust assertions for distributed computing environments. Consider parameterizing test data and adding more edge case coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","The outputs serve different purposes in the development lifecycle. Agent 1's request should be followed by Agent 2's implementation approach for complete test coverage."
