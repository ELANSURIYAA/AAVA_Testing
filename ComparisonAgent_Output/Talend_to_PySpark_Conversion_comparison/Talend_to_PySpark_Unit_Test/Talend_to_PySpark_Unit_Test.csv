Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"No agent outputs were provided for comparison. The input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} but no actual content was substituted. Cannot perform meaningful comparison without actual agent outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as no agent outputs were provided for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity as no agent outputs were provided for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 1 output not provided"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 2 output not provided"
