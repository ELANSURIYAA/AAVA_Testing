Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent 1 provides only a brief status message about creating a Pytest script and requests GitHub repository information. Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive solution with detailed test case specifications and complete Pytest implementation. The outputs represent fundamentally different levels of completeness - Agent 1 is a placeholder/request while Agent 2 is a full deliverable. Semantic similarity is very low (15/100) due to different purposes, structural similarity is minimal (5/100) due to completely different formats, and correctness varies significantly with Agent 1 being syntactically correct but incomplete (60/100) while Agent 2 provides robust, well-structured code (95/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent1: Line 1, Agent2: Lines 1-150","Agent 1 only mentions that a Pytest script has been created and requests GitHub credentials, while Agent 2 provides the actual comprehensive test implementation. Both relate to PySpark testing but serve completely different purposes - Agent 1 is a status update/request, Agent 2 is the actual solution. The semantic overlap is minimal as they address different aspects of the same domain."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Agent1: Line 1, Agent2: Lines 1-150","Agent 1 consists of a single paragraph with no structured content, while Agent 2 has a well-organized structure including: test case table with 10 detailed test cases, complete Pytest script with fixtures, multiple test functions, and proper code organization. The structural approaches are fundamentally different - unstructured text vs. comprehensive technical documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,60,"Line 1","Agent 1 is syntactically correct as a message but lacks any actual test content or implementation. It correctly requests necessary GitHub information but provides no substantive testing solution. The message is grammatically correct but incomplete as a deliverable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 1-150","Agent 2 provides syntactically correct and comprehensive Pytest implementation with proper imports, fixtures, test functions, and PySpark operations. Minor deduction for some test cases that might need refinement for edge case handling (lines 89-95 for schema mismatch testing could be more specific)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,78,"N/A","Average of Agent1 (60) and Agent2 (95) correctness scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,"Line 1","Agent 1 should provide the actual test implementation rather than just a status message. Include the complete Pytest script, test case specifications, and technical details as demonstrated in Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,"Lines 89-95, 97-102","Agent 2 provides excellent comprehensive coverage. Minor improvements: enhance error handling test specificity, add more detailed assertions for schema validation, and consider adding performance test cases for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"N/A","The outputs represent different stages of development. Agent 1 appears to be an intermediate status update while Agent 2 is the complete deliverable. For consistency, both agents should provide complete implementations when tasked with creating test cases."
