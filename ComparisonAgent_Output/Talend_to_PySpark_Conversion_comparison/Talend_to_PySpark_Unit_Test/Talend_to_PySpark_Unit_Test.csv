Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - Agent outputs not provided. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not substituted with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without agent outputs. Expected to compare Talend to PySpark conversion approaches but no content was provided."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without agent outputs. Would typically compare code structure, transformation logic, and data flow patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Talend_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness - no Talend conversion output provided"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot assess correctness - no PySpark conversion output provided"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be determined without agent outputs"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison. Ensure Talend to PySpark conversion outputs include complete transformation logic, data handling, and unit test implementations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Re-run comparison with properly substituted input variables containing actual agent-generated content."
