# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status: INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS**

No agent outputs were provided for comparison. The input contained placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` but no actual content was substituted. This prevents any meaningful comparison across semantic, structural, or correctness dimensions.

**Overall Scores: 0/100 across all dimensions**

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity as no agent outputs were provided for comparison. Without actual content, it's impossible to assess whether both outputs address the same goals, apply similar reasoning, or have aligned meanings.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity as no agent outputs were provided for comparison. Unable to assess logical structure, flow, decomposition approach, or component hierarchy without actual content.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness as Agent 1 output not provided
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate correctness as Agent 2 output not provided  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Cannot evaluate overall correctness without agent outputs

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Ensure that real agent outputs are substituted for the placeholder variables before running the comparison analysis.

2. **Verify Input Processing**: Check the input processing pipeline to ensure that agent outputs are properly passed to the comparison system.

3. **Re-run Analysis**: Once actual outputs are available, re-execute this comparison to obtain meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness evaluations.
