# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found instead of actual content.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)  
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare.

### Correctness
- **Agent1**: Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output
- **Agent2**: Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output  
- **Overall**: Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

Provide actual agent outputs for meaningful comparison analysis. Ensure all placeholder variables are replaced with actual content before running the comparison agent.
