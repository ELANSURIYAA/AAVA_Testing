Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Talend to PySpark conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) and structural similarity (78/100). Basic_Review offers concise analysis while Comprehensive_Review provides detailed technical mapping and enterprise-grade recommendations. Both are syntactically correct (100/100 each). Key differences lie in depth of analysis, technical detail, and structured presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Talend to PySpark conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Semantic alignment is strong with both covering data extraction, transformations, aggregation, normalization, and CSV output. Basic_Review focuses on high-level logic replication while Comprehensive_Review provides detailed component mapping (lines 25-45). Both identify similar issues: error handling (Basic_Review line 15, Comprehensive_Review line 55), logging improvements, and context variables. Comprehensive_Review adds technical depth with explicit Talend component mapping and business logic verification."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-100 vs 1-120,"Both follow similar 7-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Issues/Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, API Cost. Comprehensive_Review enhances structure with detailed subsections including tabular component mapping (lines 25-45), explicit Talend vs PySpark flow comparison, and systematic verification tables. Basic_Review uses simpler bullet-point organization while Comprehensive_Review employs hierarchical markdown with tables and detailed breakdowns. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Basic_Review,100,Lines 1-50,"Syntactically correct markdown with proper header formatting, bullet points, and section structure. All internal references are consistent. No broken formatting or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Review,100,Lines 1-120,"Syntactically correct markdown with advanced formatting including tables, horizontal rules, and hierarchical sections. All internal references, table formatting, and markdown syntax are properly structured. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, and no formatting errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Basic_Review,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Enhance error handling implementation with specific try-except blocks. Add structured logging framework integration. Replace hardcoded values with configuration management. Implement comprehensive testing with representative datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Review,N/A,Lines 90-110,"Implement enterprise-grade improvements: fix typo in context variables (line 95), integrate Python logging module, add broadcast joins for performance optimization, implement explicit null handling and type casting, and establish centralized configuration management for maintainability."
