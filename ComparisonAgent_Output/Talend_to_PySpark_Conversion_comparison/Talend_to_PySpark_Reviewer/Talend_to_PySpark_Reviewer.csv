Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both agents provide reviews of Talend to PySpark ETL migration with focus on conversion accuracy and optimization. Agent 1 offers a concise 7-section analysis while Agent 2 delivers comprehensive technical documentation with detailed component mapping and structured recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Talend to PySpark conversion accuracy. They share identical focus areas: data extraction from PostgreSQL, transformations (aggregation, normalization, enrichment), CSV output, error handling concerns, and optimization recommendations. However, Agent 2 provides significantly more technical depth with component-by-component mapping tables and specific implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-50,"Both follow similar high-level structure with Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Issues/Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, and Recommendations sections. Agent 1 uses 7 numbered sections (lines 5-48) while Agent 2 uses 7 sections with subsections and tables (lines 5-120). Agent 2 includes detailed component mapping tables and more granular subsection organization that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent1,90,1-48,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and no broken references. Minor issues: lacks detailed technical specifications and component mapping that would enhance accuracy verification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent2,95,1-120,"Agent 2 output demonstrates superior syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, well-structured tables, consistent section numbering, and comprehensive technical documentation. Includes detailed component mapping table (lines 25-40) and structured recommendations with numbered points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Both outputs maintain high syntactic correctness. Agent 2 achieves higher score due to more comprehensive technical documentation and structured presentation."
