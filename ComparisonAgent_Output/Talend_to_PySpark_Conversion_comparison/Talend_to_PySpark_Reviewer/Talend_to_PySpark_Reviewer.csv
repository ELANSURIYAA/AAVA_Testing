Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents produced comprehensive reviews of Talend to PySpark ETL migration. Ascendion_AVA_Agent1 delivered a concise 7-section analysis focusing on core conversion accuracy and optimization recommendations. Ascendion_AVA_Agent2 provided a more detailed technical review with component-by-component mapping verification, structured tables, and comprehensive discrepancy analysis. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of ETL migration challenges and provide actionable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Talend to PySpark conversion accuracy and providing optimization recommendations. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Both identify successful replication of core ETL logic, (2) Both highlight similar technical gaps (error handling, logging, context variables), (3) Both provide performance optimization suggestions (broadcast joins, caching, partitioning). Semantic divergence: Agent2 provides deeper technical analysis with specific component mappings and detailed conversion verification tables, while Agent1 focuses more on high-level assessment and practical recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both follow similar high-level structure with 7 numbered sections covering Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Issues/Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, and Cost Estimation. Structural differences: Agent1 uses consistent bullet-point formatting throughout, while Agent2 employs varied formatting including detailed tables (lines 15-25), subsections with headers, and structured component mapping. Agent2 includes a comprehensive mapping verification table and more granular section organization, while Agent1 maintains simpler linear flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent1,98,Lines 1-50,"Syntactically correct markdown with proper section numbering, consistent bullet formatting, and valid internal structure. Minor issue: Some bullet points could benefit from more consistent indentation formatting, but overall structure is well-formed and readable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent2,95,Lines 1-50,"Well-structured markdown with proper headers, tables, and formatting. Minor issues: (1) Inconsistent table formatting in some sections, (2) Some markdown table syntax could be more standardized, (3) Minor spacing inconsistencies in subsection headers. Overall document structure is comprehensive and technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section structure, and no major formatting errors. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies that do not impact readability or technical accuracy."
