Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are comprehensive reviews of Talend to PySpark ETL migration for employee data pipeline. Agent_1 provides a structured 7-section analysis covering conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. Agent_2 delivers a more detailed technical review with specific component mapping tables, comprehensive data flow analysis, and enhanced technical depth. Both address the same core migration task but with different levels of technical granularity and documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the identical core task: reviewing Talend to PySpark ETL conversion for employee data processing. They share the same fundamental understanding of the migration requirements, transformation logic (aggregation, normalization, enrichment), and output objectives. Key semantic alignments include: data extraction from PostgreSQL, transformation steps, CSV output generation, error handling concerns, optimization recommendations, and overall assessment approach. Minor semantic differences exist in technical depth and specific implementation details, but core intent and meaning are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structural patterns with numbered sections, but differ in organization depth. Agent_1 uses 7 main sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, API Cost). Agent_2 uses 7 sections with enhanced subsection hierarchy including detailed component mapping tables, comprehensive data flow analysis, and structured comparison tables. Both maintain logical flow from summary to detailed analysis to recommendations, but Agent_2 provides more granular structural decomposition with technical tables and subsections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-16,"Agent_1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown structure, consistent section numbering, and clear formatting. Minor issue: 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a formatting artifact (lines 15-16) that should be 'report'. All other elements including headers, bullet points, and content structure are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Line 8,"Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section hierarchy, well-structured tables, and comprehensive technical documentation. Minor issue: 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' formatting artifact appears once (line 8). All other structural elements including headers, tables, bullet points, and technical content are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown structure and formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting artifacts in both outputs but overall excellent structural integrity and documentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Enhance technical depth by adding specific component mapping tables and detailed data flow analysis similar to Agent_2. Include more granular technical details about transformation logic and implementation specifics. Consider expanding optimization suggestions with specific Spark configuration recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Maintain the excellent technical depth and comprehensive analysis approach. Consider streamlining some sections to improve readability while preserving technical accuracy. The detailed component mapping and structured analysis provide significant value for technical stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs should address the formatting artifact 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' which appears to be a template placeholder. Agent_2's approach of including detailed technical mapping tables and comprehensive analysis provides a superior template for technical migration reviews. Agent_1's concise structure offers good readability for executive summaries."
