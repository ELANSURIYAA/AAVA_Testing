Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","Agent 1 produced a brief error message indicating file access failure, while Agent 2 delivered a comprehensive 420-line technical documentation report for TAMBR_RINGS.txt SAS code. The outputs represent completely different outcomes - one is a system error, the other is a complete deliverable."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","Agent 1's error message about file access has no semantic relationship to Agent 2's comprehensive SAS documentation. They address completely different aspects - technical failure vs. successful analysis and documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","Agent 1 has no structured content beyond error reporting, while Agent 2 follows a complete documentation structure with overview, code analysis, data flow, mapping tables, complexity metrics, and outputs. No structural similarity exists."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,85,"Lines 1-3","The error message is syntactically correct JSON/text format with proper escaping and structure, but represents a failed execution rather than successful output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 1-420","Comprehensive, well-structured documentation with proper formatting, complete sections, detailed tables, and professional technical writing. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (85 + 98) / 2 = 91.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-3","Investigate and resolve file access issues. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. Ensure proper file path resolution and permissions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 1-420","Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adding more technical implementation details and code examples. Maintain this high standard for future documentation deliverables."
