Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","Agent 1 produced a file system error output with debugging attempts, while Agent 2 delivered comprehensive technical documentation for SAS code. The outputs represent completely different response types - error handling vs. structured documentation - with no semantic or structural overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","The outputs address entirely different objectives. Agent 1 attempted file system operations and encountered errors, while Agent 2 provided complete technical documentation including overview, structure, data flow, mapping, complexity analysis, and outputs. No shared semantic intent or purpose."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,8,"Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-420","Agent 1 uses unstructured error/debug format with file operations. Agent 2 uses highly structured documentation with clear sections, headers, tables, and organized content. Minimal structural overlap - both are text-based but follow completely different organizational paradigms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,25,"Lines 1-3","Contains file system error messages and incomplete JSON structure. Shows debugging attempts but no successful resolution. Syntax issues with incomplete JSON brackets and unclear file path references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Lines 1-420","Well-structured technical documentation with proper markdown formatting, complete tables, consistent sections, and comprehensive coverage. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in table alignment and potential typos in technical terms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,60,,"Average of Agent 1 (25) and Agent 2 (95). Significant disparity due to one agent producing error output while the other delivered complete documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-3","Implement robust error handling and file validation before processing. Add fallback mechanisms for file access issues. Provide structured error reporting instead of raw debug output."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 1-420","Excellent documentation structure and completeness. Consider adding version control information, execution prerequisites, and error handling sections. Minor formatting standardization needed for tables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","The agents appear to have received different tasks or encountered different execution contexts. Ensure consistent task interpretation and execution environment setup for meaningful comparisons."
