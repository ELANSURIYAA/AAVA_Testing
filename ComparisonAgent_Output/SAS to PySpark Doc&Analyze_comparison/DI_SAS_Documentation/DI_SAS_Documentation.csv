Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between file listing output and comprehensive SAS technical documentation. Agent 1 produced fragmented file system navigation with errors, while Agent 2 delivered complete technical documentation. Outputs serve fundamentally different purposes with no semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-420,"Agent outputs address completely different objectives. Agent 1 attempts file system navigation with error handling, while Agent 2 provides comprehensive SAS code documentation. No shared semantic intent or purpose alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-420,"Fundamentally different structural approaches. Agent 1 uses fragmented error messages and file paths, while Agent 2 employs structured documentation with clear sections, tables, and hierarchical organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,File_Listing_Output,25,Lines 1-10,"Contains file system errors and incomplete navigation attempts. Shows 'File not found' errors and fragmented directory structure. Syntax is valid but functionality is broken."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SAS_Documentation,95,Lines 1-420,"Well-formed technical documentation with proper structure, valid tables, and consistent formatting. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in complexity metrics table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,60,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (25 + 95) / 2 = 60"
Recommendations,Recommendation,File_Listing_Output,N/A,Lines 1-10,"Implement proper error handling and file system validation. Add retry mechanisms and clearer error messaging for failed file operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SAS_Documentation,N/A,Lines 1-420,"Excellent documentation quality. Consider adding more detailed code examples and cross-references to enhance usability for technical teams."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Outputs serve different purposes and cannot be meaningfully compared for business value. Ensure task requirements clearly specify expected output type and format."
