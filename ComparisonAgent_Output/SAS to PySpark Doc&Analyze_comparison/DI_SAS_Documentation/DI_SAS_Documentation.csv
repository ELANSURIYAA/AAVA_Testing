Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-420","Fundamental mismatch between outputs: SAS_Agent produced error messages and file listings while PySpark_Agent delivered comprehensive technical documentation. No meaningful comparison possible due to completely different output types and purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-420","Outputs address completely different objectives. SAS_Agent shows file system navigation errors and directory listings, while PySpark_Agent provides structured technical documentation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code including overview, data flow, mapping tables, and complexity analysis. No semantic alignment exists."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-420","No comparable structure. SAS_Agent output is unstructured error messages and file paths, while PySpark_Agent follows formal documentation structure with sections, tables, and technical specifications. Completely different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SAS_Agent,20,"Lines 1-10","Multiple file system errors including 'File not found' messages and incomplete JSON structures. Contains broken syntax with unmatched braces and incomplete statements. Technical execution appears failed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Agent,95,"Lines 1-420","Well-structured technical documentation with proper markdown formatting, complete data mapping tables, and comprehensive analysis. Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,57.5,,"Average of individual agent scores: (20 + 95) / 2 = 57.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,SAS_Agent,,"Lines 1-10","Critical issues require immediate attention: Fix file system access problems, resolve JSON syntax errors, implement proper error handling, and ensure complete output generation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_Agent,,"Lines 1-420","Excellent documentation quality. Minor improvements: Standardize table formatting, add more cross-references, and consider adding visual diagrams for complex data flows."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Complete output type mismatch indicates fundamental process failure. Recommend investigating why agents produced entirely different output types and implementing validation to ensure consistent deliverable formats."
