Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code with high semantic alignment (85/100) focusing on the same monthly batch process for generating spatial rings around bank branches. Structural similarity is strong (78/100) with both following similar documentation patterns but Agent2_Documentation providing more detailed organization. Correctness is excellent for both outputs (95/100 average) with proper formatting and consistent references. Agent1_Analysis emphasizes migration complexity and metrics while Agent2_Documentation focuses on technical implementation details and optimization strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-50,"Both outputs analyze the same TAMBR_RINGS SAS program for monthly TAMBr process. Agent1_Analysis focuses on 'data preparation, ring calculation, and customer-main relationship logic' while Agent2_Documentation describes 'spatial rings (distance bands) around bank branches'. Both identify the same core functionality: customer-branch proximity analysis, geocoding, distance calculations, and ring threshold generation. Key semantic alignment includes: ETL workflow description, macro usage identification, geospatial calculations, and PySpark migration challenges. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent1_Analysis stresses complexity metrics (82/100 complexity score) while Agent2_Documentation emphasizes technical architecture and optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,1-100,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics table, and recommendations sections. Agent1_Analysis uses a more compact format with embedded recommendations while Agent2_Documentation provides more detailed subsections including 'Syntax Differences' and 'Manual Adjustments' as separate sections. Both include comprehensive metrics tables with identical complexity scores (82/100) and similar table counts (18 vs 19 tables). Agent2_Documentation provides better organization with clear section headers and more detailed breakdown of technical considerations. Structure alignment includes: complexity metrics presentation, table usage documentation, and migration strategy recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Analysis,95,1-431,"Agent1_Analysis demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent table references, and accurate line count (431). All technical terms are correctly used, complexity metrics are properly calculated and presented in valid table format. Internal references are consistent throughout. Minor formatting inconsistency in the complexity score presentation but no syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Documentation,95,1-420,"Agent2_Documentation shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section headers, and accurate technical details. Line count (420) is properly documented, all table references are valid, and complexity metrics align with Agent1_Analysis. Technical terminology is used correctly throughout. Excellent internal consistency in references and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Average correctness score of 95/100. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper formatting, accurate technical references, and consistent internal structure. No major syntax errors or broken references detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Analysis,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Strengthen structural organization by adding dedicated subsections for syntax differences and manual adjustments similar to Agent2_Documentation. Consider expanding the optimization techniques section with more detailed implementation strategies. The compact format is efficient but could benefit from clearer section delineation for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Documentation,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Excellent structural organization and comprehensive coverage. Consider adding more quantitative complexity metrics similar to Agent1_Analysis format. The detailed subsections provide good technical depth but could benefit from a more concise executive summary section for quick reference."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable and complementary perspectives on the TAMBR_RINGS SAS analysis. Agent1_Analysis excels in quantitative metrics and concise presentation while Agent2_Documentation provides superior technical depth and organization. For optimal documentation, consider combining Agent1_Analysis's metrics focus with Agent2_Documentation's structural clarity and detailed technical sections."
