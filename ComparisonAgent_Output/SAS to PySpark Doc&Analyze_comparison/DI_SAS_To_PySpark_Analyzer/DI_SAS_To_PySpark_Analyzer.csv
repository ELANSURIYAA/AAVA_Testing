Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive technical documentation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code migration analysis. The first output focuses on detailed metrics and complexity scoring with extensive table enumeration, while the second emphasizes business context and structured technical documentation. Both identify the same core challenges: macro logic incompatibility, geospatial calculations, and percentile processing requirements for PySpark migration."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-431 vs Lines 1-420","Both outputs capture the same core business logic: monthly TAMBr process for forming priority and most-used rings around bank branches. Both identify identical technical challenges including macro variable management, geodist function replacement, PROC UNIVARIATE percentile calculations, and DATA step transformations. Minor differences in emphasis: first output focuses more on ETL complexity while second emphasizes spatial ring calculations and business context."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 200-250, 350-431","Both follow similar high-level structure with overview, complexity metrics, and recommendations sections. However, first output uses tabular complexity metrics format while second uses structured markdown with detailed subsections. First output provides more granular line counts and table enumeration, while second organizes content into clearer business-technical sections with better readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,92,"Lines 100-150, 300-350","Generally accurate technical analysis with proper SAS syntax identification. Minor issues: some table names appear duplicated in the enumeration (lines 100-120), and complexity score justification could be more detailed. All technical recommendations are sound and migration strategies are appropriate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,95,"Lines 50-100, 200-300","Highly accurate technical documentation with consistent formatting and clear structure. Excellent organization of complexity metrics in table format. All syntax differences and manual adjustments are correctly identified. Minor issue: slight inconsistency in line count reporting (420 vs 431 from first output)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy in identifying SAS-specific features and PySpark migration challenges. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting and enumeration inconsistencies but overall sound technical analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Lines 350-431","Strengthen complexity score justification with more detailed rationale. Remove duplicate table names from enumeration. Enhance readability by organizing content into clearer sections similar to second output format."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Lines 1-420","Reconcile line count discrepancy with first output. Consider adding more granular table enumeration details. Maintain excellent structural organization while adding specific complexity scoring methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs provide valuable technical analysis for SAS to PySpark migration. Consider combining the detailed metrics approach of first output with the superior organization and readability of second output. Both correctly identify rebuild recommendation and key technical challenges."
