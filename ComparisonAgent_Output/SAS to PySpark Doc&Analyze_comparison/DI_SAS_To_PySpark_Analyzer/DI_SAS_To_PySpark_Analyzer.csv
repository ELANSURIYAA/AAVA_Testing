Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive technical analysis of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code migration to PySpark. Agent_1 focuses on detailed metrics and complexity scoring with extensive table analysis (431 lines, 18 tables), while Agent_2 provides similar analysis with slightly different metrics (420 lines, 22 tables). Both recommend 'Rebuild' approach due to high complexity and SAS-specific dependencies. Key differences include table counting methodology and presentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. They share identical understanding of the business purpose (customer-main proximity rings for TAMBr process), similar complexity assessment (both score 82/100), and same migration recommendation (Rebuild). Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on data preparation aspects while Agent_2 emphasizes technical documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-100,"Highly similar logical structure with identical major sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics (table format), Syntax & Feature Compatibility Check, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Both use tabular presentation for metrics. Minor structural differences: Agent_1 includes more detailed DML statement breakdown, Agent_2 has more granular join type analysis. Flow and decomposition approach are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-25,"Minor inconsistency in table count presentation - lists 18 tables in summary but detailed breakdown suggests more. All technical content is syntactically correct, references are consistent, and recommendations are well-supported."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 10-20,"Excellent internal consistency with clear metric alignment. Table count (22) properly corresponds to detailed analysis. All technical references are accurate and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper technical terminology, consistent internal references, and accurate SAS-to-PySpark migration guidance. Average of individual scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 40-60,"Enhance table counting methodology for consistency. Consider adding more specific line references for complex sections. Maintain the strong technical depth while improving metric precision."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 30-50,"Excellent technical documentation structure. Consider adding more detailed DML statement breakdown similar to Agent_1. The clear metric alignment and internal consistency should be maintained as a standard."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable migration guidance. Consider combining Agent_1's detailed metric breakdown with Agent_2's superior structural consistency. Both correctly identify the need for complete rebuild rather than simple refactoring due to SAS macro dependencies and geospatial function complexity."
