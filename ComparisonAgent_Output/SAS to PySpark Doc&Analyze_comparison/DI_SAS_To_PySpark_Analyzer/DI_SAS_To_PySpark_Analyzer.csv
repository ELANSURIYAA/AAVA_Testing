Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive technical documentation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code analysis, focusing on complexity metrics, migration challenges, and PySpark conversion requirements. Agent_1_Analysis provides more detailed complexity scoring (82/100) and extensive manual adjustment guidance, while Agent_2_Analysis offers more structured technical documentation with clearer section organization and optimization techniques."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-20, 25-35","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for TAMBr process automation. They share identical understanding of the business purpose (forming priority and most-used rings around bank branches), key functional components (DATA steps, PROC SQL, macros), and migration complexity. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent_1_Analysis focuses more on specific complexity scoring while Agent_2_Analysis provides more structured technical documentation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 40-60","Both follow similar documentation structure with Script Overview, Complexity Metrics table, and technical analysis sections. Agent_1_Analysis uses a more metrics-focused approach with explicit complexity scoring, while Agent_2_Analysis uses clearer section headers (## Script Overview, ## Complexity Metrics, ## Syntax Differences). Both include tabular complexity metrics but with slight variations in presentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Analysis,95,"Lines 15-25","Well-formed documentation with consistent internal references, proper table formatting, and accurate technical details. Minor formatting inconsistency in the complexity metrics table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Analysis,98,"Lines 10-30","Excellent documentation structure with proper Markdown formatting, consistent section headers, and well-organized technical content. Clean table formatting and clear hierarchical organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness as technical documentation with proper formatting and consistent internal references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Analysis,,"Lines 35-50","Provides highly detailed migration guidance with specific PySpark conversion strategies, optimization techniques, and explicit complexity scoring. Excellent for technical implementation teams requiring detailed migration roadmaps."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Analysis,,"Lines 25-45","Offers well-structured technical documentation with clear section organization and comprehensive optimization techniques. Better suited for stakeholders requiring organized technical specifications and systematic migration planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs provide valuable technical analysis of the same SAS code. Agent_1_Analysis excels in detailed complexity scoring and specific migration guidance, while Agent_2_Analysis provides superior documentation structure and organization. Combined, they offer comprehensive coverage for both technical implementation and strategic planning needs."
