Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive technical analysis of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. Agent 1 focuses on detailed metrics and complexity scoring, while Agent 2 emphasizes technical documentation structure. Both identify the same core functionality: monthly batch process for spatial ring calculations around bank branches, customer-main proximity analysis, and ETL workflows. Key differences include presentation style (metrics-focused vs documentation-focused) and depth of technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, Lines 100-150, Lines 200-250","Both outputs address identical core purpose: analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. Both identify same key components (DATA steps, PROC SQL, macros, spatial calculations, percentile logic). Agent 1 emphasizes complexity scoring (82/100) while Agent 2 focuses on technical documentation structure. Both recommend 'Rebuild' approach due to SAS-specific features. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 highlights macro usage complexity, Agent 2 emphasizes spatial ring functionality. Both identify same tables (18-19 count), joins (10+ types), and conditional logic patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 51-100, Lines 151-200, Lines 251-300","Both outputs follow similar analytical structure: Overview → Complexity Metrics → Syntax Analysis → Manual Adjustments → Optimization. Agent 1 uses tabular metrics presentation, Agent 2 uses structured documentation format. Both organize content into logical sections covering same topics. Key structural differences: Agent 1 includes explicit complexity scoring table, Agent 2 uses markdown-style headers. Both cover identical technical areas: table usage, joins, temporary tables, aggregate functions, DML statements, conditional logic. Flow and decomposition approach highly similar with different presentation styles."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 25-30, Lines 75-80","Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-formatted table structure, consistent metric categorization, and accurate technical details. Minor issues: Line 25 shows slight inconsistency in table count description format. Line 75-80 complexity score justification could be more detailed. All technical references are accurate and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 40-45, Lines 120-125, Lines 180-185","Agent 2 shows strong syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and consistent technical documentation structure. Minor issues: Line 40-45 shows slight inconsistency in table count (19 vs 18). Line 120-125 has minor formatting inconsistency in syntax differences section. Line 180-185 optimization techniques section could benefit from more structured presentation. Overall technical accuracy is high."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting and consistency issues. Average score reflects strong technical accuracy across both analyses."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Maintain detailed metrics-driven approach for technical complexity assessment. Consider adding more structured documentation format similar to Agent 2 for improved readability. Enhance complexity score justification with more granular line-by-line analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Maintain comprehensive technical documentation structure. Consider incorporating quantitative complexity metrics similar to Agent 1 for more objective assessment. Improve consistency in table counts and formatting across sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable complementary perspectives on SAS-to-PySpark migration analysis. Consider combining Agent 1's quantitative metrics approach with Agent 2's structured documentation format for optimal technical analysis. Both correctly identify 'Rebuild' as the recommended migration strategy due to SAS-specific complexity."
