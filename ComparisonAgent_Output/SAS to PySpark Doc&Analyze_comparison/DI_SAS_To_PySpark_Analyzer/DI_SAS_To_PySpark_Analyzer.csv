Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents produced comprehensive technical documentation analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. Agent 1 focuses on detailed metrics and complexity scoring with structured tables, while Agent 2 emphasizes technical documentation with markdown formatting and comprehensive syntax analysis. Both identify the same complexity score (82/100) and recommend 'Rebuild' approach. Key differences lie in presentation style and depth of certain technical sections."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing SAS code complexity for PySpark migration. They share identical complexity scores (82/100), same recommendation (Rebuild), and cover similar technical aspects including macro usage, geospatial calculations, and ETL processes. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on structured metrics while Agent 2 provides more narrative technical documentation. Both identify the same high-complexity areas and migration challenges."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs follow logical technical documentation structure but with different organizational approaches. Agent 1 uses structured sections (Script Overview, Complexity Metrics table, Syntax & Feature Compatibility, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques) while Agent 2 uses markdown-formatted sections with similar content but different hierarchy. Both include complexity metrics tables with identical core data but different formatting. Agent 1 uses more tabular presentation while Agent 2 uses more narrative flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-25,"Highly accurate technical content with proper SAS syntax analysis and PySpark migration considerations. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity metrics table structure. All technical details about macros, PROC statements, and migration challenges are syntactically correct and technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 35-45,"Accurate technical documentation with proper markdown formatting and comprehensive syntax analysis. Minor inconsistencies in table formatting and some redundant information in syntax differences section. Technical content is sound but presentation could be more concise in certain areas."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper understanding of SAS-to-PySpark migration challenges. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting and presentation issues rather than technical inaccuracies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Maintain structured tabular presentation for metrics but consider adding more narrative context for better readability. The complexity scoring methodology is excellent and should be retained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Excellent use of markdown formatting for readability. Consider consolidating redundant information in syntax differences section and improving table formatting consistency for better professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide valuable technical analysis with complementary strengths. Agent 1's structured metrics approach combined with Agent 2's narrative documentation style would create an optimal technical report. Both correctly identify the high complexity and recommend rebuild approach for the SAS-to-PySpark migration."
