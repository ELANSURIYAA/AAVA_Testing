Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,95,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive technical analysis of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code migration to PySpark. Minor differences in specific metrics and phrasing, but overall alignment on complexity assessment (82/100), rebuild recommendation, and migration challenges. Both identify key technical hurdles including macro logic, spatial calculations, and SAS-specific functions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,94,"Lines 1-431 vs 1-420","Both outputs address identical core objective of SAS to PySpark migration analysis. Same business understanding of TAMBr process, ring calculations, and customer-main relationships. Minor differences: Output 1 reports 431 lines vs Output 2's 420 lines, and slight variations in table counts (18 vs 19). Both reach same conclusion of 82/100 complexity score and rebuild recommendation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"Lines 15-200","Nearly identical structural organization with matching sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics table, syntax differences, manual adjustments, optimization techniques. Both use tabular format for metrics, bullet points for recommendations, and similar sectioning. Minor difference in table formatting and some subsection ordering."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output1,98,"Lines 1-431","Well-formatted technical documentation with consistent internal structure. Proper table formatting, accurate line counts, comprehensive coverage of migration aspects. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity metrics table alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SAS_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output2,97,"Lines 1-420","Properly structured technical documentation with clear sectioning and formatting. Consistent markdown formatting, accurate technical details, comprehensive analysis. Minor inconsistency in table count reporting (19 vs actual enumerated tables)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,"All lines","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical content. No broken references or syntax errors detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output1,,"Lines 300-431","Maintain comprehensive approach to complexity analysis. Consider standardizing table count methodology for consistency. Excellent coverage of migration challenges and optimization strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_SAS_To_PySpark_Analyzer_Output2,,"Lines 280-420","Strong technical analysis with good structural organization. Recommend verifying table count accuracy (reported 19 vs enumerated count). Maintain detailed syntax difference documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis suitable for migration planning. Consider establishing standard templates for complexity metrics reporting to ensure consistency across similar analyses. Both correctly identify rebuild as optimal strategy given SAS-specific dependencies."
