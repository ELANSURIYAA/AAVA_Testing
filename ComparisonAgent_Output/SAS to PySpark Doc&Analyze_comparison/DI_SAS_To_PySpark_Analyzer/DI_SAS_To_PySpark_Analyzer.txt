# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive technical analysis of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code migration to PySpark. Agent_1 focuses on detailed metrics and complexity scoring with extensive table analysis (431 lines, 18 tables), while Agent_2 provides similar analysis with slightly different metrics (420 lines, 22 tables). Both recommend 'Rebuild' approach due to high complexity and SAS-specific dependencies. Key differences include table counting methodology and presentation structure.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing TAMBR_RINGS SAS code for PySpark migration. They share identical understanding of the business purpose (customer-main proximity rings for TAMBr process), similar complexity assessment (both score 82/100), and same migration recommendation (Rebuild). Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on data preparation aspects while Agent_2 emphasizes technical documentation structure.

**Line References:** Lines 1-50 show consistent business context understanding across both outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Highly similar logical structure with identical major sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics (table format), Syntax & Feature Compatibility Check, Manual Adjustments, and Optimization Techniques. Both use tabular presentation for metrics. Minor structural differences: Agent_1 includes more detailed DML statement breakdown, Agent_2 has more granular join type analysis. Flow and decomposition approach are nearly identical.

**Line References:** Lines 1-100 demonstrate consistent section organization and flow.

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 95/100):** Minor inconsistency in table count presentation - lists 18 tables in summary but detailed breakdown suggests more. All technical content is syntactically correct, references are consistent, and recommendations are well-supported.

**Agent_2 (Score: 98/100):** Excellent internal consistency with clear metric alignment. Table count (22) properly corresponds to detailed analysis. All technical references are accurate and well-formatted.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **92** | **93** | **92** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:** Enhance table counting methodology for consistency. Consider adding more specific line references for complex sections. Maintain the strong technical depth while improving metric precision.

**For Agent_2:** Excellent technical documentation structure. Consider adding more detailed DML statement breakdown similar to Agent_1. The clear metric alignment and internal consistency should be maintained as a standard.

**For Both:** Both outputs provide valuable migration guidance. Consider combining Agent_1's detailed metric breakdown with Agent_2's superior structural consistency. Both correctly identify the need for complete rebuild rather than simple refactoring due to SAS macro dependencies and geospatial function complexity.
