Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-89,"Both agents address PySpark migration cost and effort estimation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Agent_1_Detailed_Cost provides comprehensive analysis with complete runtime cost calculation ($1.62 USD) and 35-hour effort estimate. Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost acknowledges inability to complete cost estimation due to missing environment details but provides detailed 54-hour effort breakdown. Key difference: Agent 1 delivers complete solution while Agent 2 provides partial deliverable with clear limitations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-89,"Both outputs address the same core objective of PySpark migration planning for TAMBR_RINGS. Agent_1_Detailed_Cost provides complete cost analysis with specific Azure Databricks configuration and DBU calculations. Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost acknowledges missing environment details and requests additional information. Both provide comprehensive effort breakdowns covering macro conversion, DataFrame transformations, geospatial calculations, and testing. However, effort estimates differ significantly (35 vs 54 hours), indicating different complexity assessments. The semantic intent aligns but execution completeness varies substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-89,"Both outputs follow similar structural organization: 1.1 Cost Estimation section followed by 2.1 Code Fixing and Testing Effort section. Both use tabular format for effort breakdown and include API cost tracking. Agent_1_Detailed_Cost provides complete cost calculation breakdown with specific technical details (cluster configuration, DBU rates, duration estimates). Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost maintains same section structure but explicitly states cost estimation incompleteness. Both include detailed task breakdowns in tabular format, though with different granularity levels."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Detailed_Cost,95,Lines 1-45,"Syntactically correct with proper formatting, complete calculations, and consistent technical specifications. Minor deduction for assumed pricing ($0.27/DBU) without explicit confirmation statement. All mathematical calculations are accurate (3 nodes x 2 hours = 6 DBU, 6 x $0.27 = $1.62). Technical details are internally consistent and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost,90,Lines 1-89,"Syntactically correct with proper formatting and clear acknowledgment of limitations. Appropriately requests missing environment details rather than making assumptions. All provided technical details are accurate and well-structured. Minor deduction for incomplete deliverable, though the incompleteness is properly acknowledged and justified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,Lines 1-89,"Average correctness score of 92.5, rounded to 93. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic accuracy and internal consistency. Agent_1_Detailed_Cost provides complete solution with minor assumption disclaimer needed. Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost maintains accuracy while properly handling missing information."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Detailed_Cost,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with complete cost calculation. Recommend adding explicit disclaimer about assumed pricing rates and suggesting validation with actual Azure pricing. Consider expanding testing effort estimate to match Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost's more detailed breakdown."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Incomplete_Cost,N/A,Lines 46-89,"Good handling of missing information with appropriate acknowledgment. Recommend proactive request for specific environment details needed (cluster type, node specifications, pricing tier, data volume estimates) to enable complete analysis. The detailed effort breakdown is comprehensive and well-structured."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-89,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized effort estimation methodology to reconcile 35 vs 54 hour difference, 2) Risk assessment for migration complexity factors, 3) Validation framework for cost and effort estimates, 4) Clear assumptions documentation for all calculations and estimates."
