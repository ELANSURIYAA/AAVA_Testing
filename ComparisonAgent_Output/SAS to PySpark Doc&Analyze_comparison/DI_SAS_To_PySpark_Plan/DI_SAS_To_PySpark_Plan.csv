Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide effort estimation for PySpark migration of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Agent_Comprehensive delivers complete cost analysis ($1.62 runtime cost, 35 hours effort) while Agent_Incomplete lacks runtime cost details but provides more detailed effort breakdown (54 hours). Semantic alignment is strong (85/100) with both addressing migration requirements. Structural similarity is moderate (72/100) due to different organization approaches. Agent_Comprehensive has perfect syntax (100/100) while Agent_Incomplete has minor formatting issues (95/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-80","Both outputs address PySpark migration cost and effort estimation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Core semantic alignment includes: migration complexity assessment, manual code fixes identification, testing effort estimation, and API cost tracking. Key differences: Agent_Comprehensive provides complete runtime cost calculation while Agent_Incomplete acknowledges missing environment details. Both identify similar technical challenges (geodist UDF, macro conversion, percentile logic) but with different effort estimates (35 vs 54 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 5-25 vs 10-35","Both follow similar high-level structure: header/metadata, cost estimation section, effort estimation section. Agent_Comprehensive uses numbered hierarchical structure (1.1, 1.1.1, 2.1) while Agent_Incomplete uses mixed formatting. Both include effort estimation tables but Agent_Comprehensive provides more detailed cost breakdown with specific calculations. Agent_Incomplete has more granular task breakdown in effort estimation table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive,100,N/A,"Perfect syntax and formatting. All sections properly structured, calculations are mathematically correct, table formatting is consistent, and all references are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Incomplete,95,"Lines 15-20, 45","Minor formatting inconsistencies: missing proper table formatting in some sections, inconsistent spacing in effort estimation table headers, and incomplete cost section structure. Content is otherwise syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive,N/A,"Lines 20-35","Excellent comprehensive approach with complete cost analysis. Maintain detailed calculation methodology and clear effort breakdown structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Incomplete,N/A,"Lines 10-15, 40-60","Provide complete environment details for runtime cost calculation. Improve table formatting consistency and section structure alignment with standard documentation practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-80","Consider standardizing effort estimation methodology between agents. Agent_Comprehensive's detailed cost calculation approach should be adopted. Agent_Incomplete's granular task breakdown provides valuable detail that could enhance Agent_Comprehensive's approach."
