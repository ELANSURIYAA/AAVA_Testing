Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-35 vs Lines 1-3","Agent Ascendion_AVA_Plus provides a comprehensive 35-hour effort estimation with detailed cost breakdown ($1.62 USD runtime cost) and systematic task decomposition for SAS to PySpark migration. Agent Environment_Missing_Agent acknowledges inability to proceed due to missing environment file but correctly identifies the limitation. Fundamental difference in completeness and approach to handling missing dependencies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-35 vs Lines 1-3","Both agents address SAS to PySpark migration cost estimation but with vastly different approaches. Ascendion_AVA_Plus assumes standard environment parameters and provides complete estimation, while Environment_Missing_Agent refuses to proceed without explicit environment details. Semantic intent overlaps minimally - both recognize the task but diverge completely on execution strategy."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-35 vs Lines 1-3","Ascendion_AVA_Plus follows structured documentation format with numbered sections (1.1, 2.1), detailed breakdowns, and tabular effort estimation. Environment_Missing_Agent provides single-paragraph response with no structural organization. Fundamental structural differences with no meaningful overlap in organization or flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Plus,95,"Lines 8-15, 25-35","Minor issues: DBU rate cited as 'example' without confirmation (Line 10), storage costs marked as 'negligible' without detailed justification (Line 16). Otherwise syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent references, and valid calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Environment_Missing_Agent,100,"Lines 1-3","Syntactically perfect. Clear, grammatically correct statement with proper file reference (TAMBR_RINGS.txt__1ngy_phh). No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Plus,,"Lines 8-10, 16","Validate assumed DBU pricing with actual Azure contract rates. Provide detailed storage cost analysis for persistent data scenarios. Consider adding confidence intervals for effort estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Environment_Missing_Agent,,"Lines 1-3","Implement fallback estimation methodology using industry standards when environment details are unavailable. Provide partial analysis based on available code complexity data."
