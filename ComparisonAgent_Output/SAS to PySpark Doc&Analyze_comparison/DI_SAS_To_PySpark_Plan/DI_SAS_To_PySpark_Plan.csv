Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive effort estimation for PySpark migration of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Agent_1 delivers complete cost analysis with $1.62 runtime cost and 35-hour effort estimate, while Agent_2 provides more detailed technical breakdown with 54-hour estimate but incomplete runtime costing due to missing environment details. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with different approaches to effort breakdown."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of PySpark migration cost/effort estimation. Agent_1 focuses on complete cost calculation with runtime breakdown, while Agent_2 emphasizes detailed technical migration challenges. Both identify similar manual fixes (macros, geodist, percentiles, SQL conversion) but with different granularity levels. The semantic alignment is strong despite different emphasis areas."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both follow similar high-level structure: Cost Estimation section followed by Code Fixing/Testing Effort. Agent_1 uses nested numbering (1.1, 1.1.1, 2.1) while Agent_2 uses simpler numbering. Both include effort estimation tables, but Agent_2 provides more granular task breakdown (11 vs 9 categories). Structure is comparable but with different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8-15,"Minor formatting inconsistency in effort table alignment, otherwise syntactically correct with proper markdown structure, valid calculations, and consistent formatting throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 12-14,"Some inconsistent spacing in bullet points and minor formatting variations in table structure. Content is syntactically sound with proper markdown formatting overall."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting inconsistencies. No broken references, undefined variables, or structural errors detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-35,"Excellent comprehensive approach with complete cost analysis. Consider adding more granular task breakdown similar to Agent_2's approach for better project planning precision."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-54,"Strong technical detail and thorough task breakdown. Should complete the runtime cost estimation by obtaining required environment details to match Agent_1's comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized effort estimation methodology, 2) Risk factor considerations for effort estimates, 3) Validation approach specification, 4) Timeline and resource allocation recommendations."
