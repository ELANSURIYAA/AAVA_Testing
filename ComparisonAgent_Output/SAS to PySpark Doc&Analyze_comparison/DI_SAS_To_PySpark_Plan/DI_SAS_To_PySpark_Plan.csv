Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-89 (Agent_1), Lines 1-78 (Agent_2)","Both outputs provide PySpark migration cost and effort estimates for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Agent_1 delivers complete runtime cost ($1.62 USD) and 35-hour effort estimate. Agent_2 provides incomplete runtime cost (missing environment details) but more detailed 54-hour effort breakdown. Semantic alignment is strong despite different approaches to cost calculation and effort granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 8-20 (Agent_1), Lines 8-12 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address PySpark migration cost estimation with same underlying goal. Agent_1 provides complete cost calculation while Agent_2 acknowledges incomplete data. Effort estimation approaches differ in granularity (35 vs 54 hours) but cover similar transformation areas. Deduction for incomplete cost estimation in Agent_2 and different effort estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-89 (Agent_1), Lines 1-78 (Agent_2)","Both follow similar high-level structure with cost estimation and effort estimation sections. Agent_1 uses more detailed cost breakdown with specific calculations, while Agent_2 uses tabular format for effort breakdown. Both include similar subsections but organize content differently. Deduction for different organizational approaches and missing cost details in Agent_2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-89,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, complete calculations, valid cost breakdown, and consistent structure throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 8-12,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting and structure. Minor deduction for incomplete cost estimation section that acknowledges missing data rather than providing placeholder calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 21-89,"Strengthen effort estimation by providing more granular task breakdown similar to Agent_2. Consider adding contingency planning for cost variations based on data volume changes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 8-12, Lines 78","Complete the runtime cost estimation by obtaining required environment details. Consider providing estimated cost ranges or assumptions when exact details are unavailable to maintain completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Standardize effort estimation methodology and cost calculation approaches. Both outputs would benefit from uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analysis for key variables like data volume and processing time."
