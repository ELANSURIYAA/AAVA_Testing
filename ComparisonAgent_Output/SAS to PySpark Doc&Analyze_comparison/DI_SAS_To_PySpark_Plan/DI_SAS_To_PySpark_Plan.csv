Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-85,"Both outputs address PySpark migration cost and effort estimation for TAMBR_RINGS SAS code. Agent_1_Output provides complete analysis with runtime costs ($1.62 USD) and 35-hour effort estimate. Agent_2_Output lacks runtime cost calculation due to missing environment details but provides more detailed 54-hour effort breakdown. Semantic alignment is strong (85/100) as both understand the migration task. Structural similarity is moderate (72/100) due to different organization approaches. Agent_1_Output has perfect syntax (100/100) while Agent_2_Output has minor formatting issues (95/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-85,"Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of PySpark migration requirements. Agent_1_Output (lines 1-85) provides comprehensive cost analysis with specific Azure Databricks configuration and runtime calculations. Agent_2_Output (lines 1-85) focuses more on detailed effort breakdown but acknowledges incomplete cost analysis. Both identify similar technical challenges: macro conversion, geodist implementation, percentile calculations, and data reconciliation. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent_1_Output prioritizes cost quantification while Agent_2_Output emphasizes technical complexity assessment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,1-85,"Agent_1_Output follows structured approach: Cost Estimation (1.1) with runtime details, then Code Fixing (2.1) with effort table. Agent_2_Output uses similar numbering but different flow: incomplete Cost section (1.1.1), then detailed Code Fixing (2.1) with comprehensive task breakdown. Both use tabular effort estimates but Agent_2_Output provides more granular task categorization (11 vs 9 categories). Agent_1_Output has cleaner section hierarchy while Agent_2_Output has more detailed technical analysis structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,1-85,"Perfect syntax and formatting throughout. All sections properly numbered (1.1, 1.1.1, 2.1). Cost calculations mathematically correct (3 nodes x 2 hours = 6 DBU, 6 x $0.27 = $1.62). Table formatting consistent with proper headers and alignment. All technical terms and references accurate. No syntax errors or formatting inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,1-85,"Minor formatting inconsistencies detected. Line 8: Missing period after 'calculation'. Line 15: Inconsistent spacing in section numbering '1.1.1'. Line 45: Table formatting slightly misaligned compared to standard markdown. Line 78: Inconsistent capitalization in 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting'. Otherwise syntactically sound with proper structure and accurate technical content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual agent scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with only minor formatting issues in Agent_2_Output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,1-85,"Excellent comprehensive approach with complete cost analysis. Maintain the structured format and detailed runtime calculations. Consider adding more granular task breakdown similar to Agent_2_Output for enhanced project planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,1-85,"Strong technical analysis with detailed effort breakdown. Address the incomplete cost calculation by obtaining required environment details. Fix minor formatting inconsistencies (lines 8, 15, 45, 78) and standardize section numbering format."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-85,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized effort estimation methodology, 2) Risk assessment for effort estimates, 3) Validation approach definition, 4) Timeline and resource allocation details, 5) Success criteria and acceptance testing framework."
