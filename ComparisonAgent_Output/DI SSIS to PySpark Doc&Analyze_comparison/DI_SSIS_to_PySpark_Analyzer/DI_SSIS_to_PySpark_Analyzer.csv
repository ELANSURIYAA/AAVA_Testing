Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"The two agent outputs are completely identical in content, structure, and formatting. Both provide comprehensive documentation for the SSIS package EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount with identical complexity metrics (65/100), syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization recommendations. Perfect semantic and structural alignment with no syntactic errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,,"Both outputs convey identical meaning and intent. They address the same SSIS to PySpark migration analysis with identical complexity assessments, syntax gap identification, and conversion recommendations. No semantic divergence detected."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,,"Both outputs follow identical structural organization: Package Overview, Complexity Metrics table, Syntax Differences with subsections, Manual Adjustments with subsections, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and apiCost. Section ordering and logical flow are perfectly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer_Output1,100,,"Output 1 demonstrates perfect internal consistency with valid markdown formatting, consistent table structure, proper section numbering, and coherent cross-references throughout the document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer_Output2,100,,"Output 2 demonstrates perfect internal consistency with valid markdown formatting, consistent table structure, proper section numbering, and coherent cross-references throughout the document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs maintain perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies detected."
