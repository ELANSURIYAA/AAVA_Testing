Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"The two agent outputs are completely identical documentation for SSIS package EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount. Both provide comprehensive ETL documentation including package overview (lines 7-9), complexity metrics table (lines 15-28), syntax differences analysis (lines 33-59), manual adjustments requirements (lines 63-85), conversion complexity assessment (lines 89-107), and optimization techniques (lines 111-125). Perfect semantic alignment with identical structure and syntax throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,,"Both outputs address the exact same SSIS package documentation with identical intent, meaning, and purpose. All sections cover identical topics with same complexity score of 65/100, same apiCost of 0.00000000 USD, and identical recommendations for Refactor vs Rebuild. Content demonstrates perfect semantic equivalence across all 7 main sections."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,,"Perfect structural alignment with identical organization: 7 main sections in exact same order, identical table structure for complexity metrics (lines 15-28 with 8 rows), identical subsection hierarchy (sections 3.a, 3.b, 3.c for syntax differences), identical bullet point formatting throughout, and identical markdown header structure. Both follow exact same logical flow and decomposition approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DimBillingAccount_Doc_1,100,,"Syntactically correct markdown documentation with valid table formatting including proper pipe separators (lines 15-28), consistent header hierarchy using # symbols, proper bullet point syntax with - characters, valid markdown syntax throughout all 130+ lines, and no broken references or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DimBillingAccount_Doc_2,100,,"Syntactically correct markdown documentation with valid table formatting including proper pipe separators (lines 15-28), consistent header hierarchy using # symbols, proper bullet point syntax with - characters, valid markdown syntax throughout all 130+ lines, and no broken references or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid markdown formatting, consistent structure, proper table syntax, and no syntax errors or broken references throughout the entire documentation."

The structured approach covering complexity metrics, syntax differences, and optimization techniques provides excellent foundation for PySpark conversion planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs are identical and represent high-quality technical documentation. This format should be considered the standard template for SSIS package analysis. The comprehensive coverage of complexity metrics (11 tasks, 7 joins), detailed syntax mapping, and specific optimization recommendations provide actionable guidance for engineering teams executing PySpark migrations."
