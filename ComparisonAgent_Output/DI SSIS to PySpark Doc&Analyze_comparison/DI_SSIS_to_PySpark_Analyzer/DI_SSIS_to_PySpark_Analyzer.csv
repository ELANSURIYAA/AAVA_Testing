Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,100,"Lines 1-145","Both outputs are identical SSIS package documentation for EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount. Perfect semantic alignment (100/100) as they address the same ETL modernization goal with identical content structure and technical details. Perfect structural similarity (100/100) with matching section organization, table formatting, and logical flow. Perfect correctness (100/100) with valid markdown syntax, consistent internal references, and proper technical terminology throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-145","Both outputs demonstrate identical semantic intent and meaning. They address the same core objective of documenting SSIS to PySpark migration complexity for the DimBillingAccount ETL package. Key semantic elements are perfectly aligned: package purpose (lines 7-10), complexity assessment (lines 15-30), syntax gap analysis (lines 35-65), manual adjustment requirements (lines 70-95), conversion complexity evaluation (lines 100-115), and optimization recommendations (lines 120-135). No semantic divergence detected."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-145","Structural organization is identical across both outputs. Both follow the same 7-section hierarchy: Package Overview, Complexity Metrics (with structured table), Syntax Differences (with 3 subsections), Manual Adjustments (with 3 subsections), Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and apiCost. Markdown formatting, table structure (lines 15-25), bullet point organization (lines 35-95), and section numbering are perfectly consistent. No structural differences identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,100,"Lines 1-145","Output1 demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness. All markdown syntax is valid including headers (#), tables (|), bullet points (-), bold formatting (**), and code formatting (`). Internal references are consistent, technical terminology is accurate, and document structure is well-formed. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,100,"Lines 1-145","Output2 demonstrates identical syntactic correctness to Output1. All markdown syntax is valid including headers (#), tables (|), bullet points (-), bold formatting (**), and code formatting (`). Internal references are consistent, technical terminology is accurate, and document structure is well-formed. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-145","Overall correctness score is perfect (100/100) as both outputs maintain identical syntactic validity. The average of Output1 (100) and Output2 (100) equals 100. Both outputs demonstrate professional technical documentation standards with proper markdown formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-145","Since both outputs are identical, no differentiation recommendations are needed. Both outputs provide comprehensive SSIS to PySpark migration documentation with excellent technical depth and clarity. For future iterations, consider: 1) Adding specific code examples for PySpark implementations mentioned in sections 3-4, 2) Including estimated effort hours for each complexity area identified, 3) Providing more detailed error handling patterns for the custom implementations described in section 4a, 4) Adding performance benchmarking criteria for the optimization techniques in section 6."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Lines 1-145","Output1 provides excellent technical documentation quality. Maintain current structure and depth of analysis. Consider enhancing with concrete code samples for the PySpark equivalents mentioned throughout the syntax differences section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Lines 1-145","Output2 provides excellent technical documentation quality identical to Output1. Maintain current structure and depth of analysis. Consider enhancing with concrete code samples for the PySpark equivalents mentioned throughout the syntax differences section."
