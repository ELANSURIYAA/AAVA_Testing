|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Structural Similarity | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **100** | **100** | **100** |

## Recommendations

### For Both Agents
Since both outputs are identical and demonstrate exceptional quality, no modifications are required. The documentation successfully provides:

- Comprehensive SSIS package analysis with detailed complexity metrics
- Thorough syntax difference mapping for PySpark conversion
- Clear manual adjustment requirements and implementation guidance
- Strategic optimization techniques for enterprise-scale ETL modernization

### Quality Validation
Both agents produced documentation that meets enterprise standards for:
- **Technical Accuracy**: Precise SSIS component analysis and PySpark mapping
- **Completeness**: All critical conversion aspects addressed systematically  
- **Actionability**: Clear implementation guidance with specific recommendations
- **Professional Formatting**: Consistent structure suitable for technical stakeholders

The identical outputs indicate either perfect consistency in agent behavior or potential duplication in the input processing pipeline. Both scenarios result in high-quality deliverables suitable for ETL modernization planning and execution.
