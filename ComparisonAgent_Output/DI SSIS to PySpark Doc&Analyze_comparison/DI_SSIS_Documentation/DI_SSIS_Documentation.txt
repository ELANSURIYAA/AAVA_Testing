Both agent outputs are identical SSIS documentation for the EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount package. The comparison reveals perfect alignment across all evaluation dimensions with scores of 100/100 for semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness. No differences were detected between the two outputs.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 100/100)

Both outputs convey identical meaning and intent regarding the SSIS package documentation. They describe:
- The same business purpose: ETL for DimBillingAccount dimension loading
- Identical technical components and architecture
- Same data flow and transformation logic
- Equivalent data mapping specifications
- Matching key outputs and business alignment

**Line References:** Lines 1-150 show complete semantic alignment with no divergence in meaning or intent.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 100/100)

The outputs follow identical structural organization:
1. **Overview of Package** (Lines 1-15)
2. **Package Design and Structure** (Lines 16-35)
3. **Data Flow and Transformation Logic** (Lines 36-55)
4. **Data Mapping** (Lines 56-120) - Including identical table structure
5. **Key Outputs** (Lines 121-140)
6. **API Cost** (Lines 141-150)

The section ordering, subsection hierarchy, bullet point structure, and logical flow are perfectly aligned.

### Correctness

**Agent_1: 100/100**
- Perfect syntax correctness across all technical terminology
- Valid table structure and formatting
- Consistent documentation standards
- No syntax errors or inconsistencies detected

**Agent_2: 100/100**
- Perfect syntax correctness across all technical terminology
- Valid table structure and formatting
- Consistent documentation standards
