Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,100,Lines 1-148,"Both agent outputs are identical SSIS documentation for EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount ETL package. Perfect semantic alignment (100/100) with identical business logic, technical specifications, and data mapping details. Perfect structural similarity (100/100) with identical section organization, subsection flow, and content hierarchy. Perfect correctness (100/100) for both agents with valid technical documentation, consistent internal references, and proper formatting. Overall assessment: 100/100 - outputs are functionally equivalent with no meaningful differences detected."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,Lines 1-148,"Both outputs convey identical meaning and intent for SSIS ETL documentation. Same business case (maintaining up-to-date billing account dimension data), identical technical approach (extract from GuideWire, transform via lookup/conditional split, load to DimBillingAccount), and same operational outcomes (insert/update/unchanged tracking). No semantic divergence detected across all sections including overview, design structure, data flow logic, mappings, and outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,Lines 1-148,"Perfect structural alignment with identical section organization: 1) Overview (lines 7-14), 2) Package Design (lines 16-30), 3) Data Flow Logic (lines 32-44), 4) Data Mapping table (lines 46-71), 5) Key Outputs (lines 73-80), 6) API Cost (lines 82-83). Same subsection flow, bullet point structure, table formatting, and logical decomposition approach throughout both documents."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_1,100,Lines 1-148,"Syntactically correct documentation with valid technical references, consistent SSIS component naming (OLE_SRC, LKP, CSPL, DRV, CMD, CNT), proper table structure in data mapping section, and coherent internal cross-references. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_2,100,Lines 1-148,"Syntactically correct documentation with valid technical references, consistent SSIS component naming (OLE_SRC, LKP, CSPL, DRV, CMD, CNT), proper table structure in data mapping section, and coherent internal cross-references. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-148,"Average correctness score of 100 based on both agents achieving perfect syntax-level correctness. Both outputs demonstrate proper technical documentation standards with valid SSIS terminology, consistent formatting, and accurate internal references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-148,"No improvements needed - both outputs are identical and technically accurate. For future iterations: 1) Consider adding version control information, 2) Include estimated execution time and resource requirements, 3) Add troubleshooting section for common ETL issues, 4) Specify data quality validation rules, 5) Document rollback procedures for failed loads."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_1,,Lines 1-148,"Output is complete and accurate. Consider enhancing with performance metrics, error handling details, and operational monitoring guidelines for production deployment."
