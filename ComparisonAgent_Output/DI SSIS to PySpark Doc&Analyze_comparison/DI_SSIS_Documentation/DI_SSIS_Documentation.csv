Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-115,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced identical SSIS documentation for the EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount package. The outputs are semantically equivalent (100/100), structurally identical (100/100), and syntactically correct (100/100 each). No differences were detected across any evaluation dimension. Both documents provide comprehensive coverage of package overview, design structure, data flow logic, mappings, and outputs. The documentation quality is enterprise-grade with proper formatting, detailed technical specifications, and clear business context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,Lines 1-115,"Perfect semantic alignment between outputs. Both documents address identical goals: documenting the SSIS ETL package for DimBillingAccount dimension loading. Intent, purpose, business context, technical specifications, and outcomes are completely aligned. No conceptual differences detected."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,Lines 1-115,"Identical document structure and logical flow. Both follow the same 6-section organization: (1) Overview, (2) Package Design, (3) Data Flow Logic, (4) Data Mapping with tabular format, (5) Key Outputs, (6) API Cost. Section ordering, subsection hierarchy, bullet point structure, and table formatting are identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-115,"Syntactically correct documentation. No formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Table formatting is valid, bullet points are properly structured, technical terminology is accurate, and internal references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-115,"Syntactically correct documentation. No formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies. Table formatting is valid, bullet points are properly structured, technical terminology is accurate, and internal references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-115,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, structural issues, or internal inconsistencies detected."
