# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agent outputs are identical technical documentation reports for SSIS to PySpark migration cost estimation. They contain the same structure, content, calculations, and formatting with no discernible differences. This represents a perfect match across all evaluation dimensions.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 100/100)

Perfect semantic alignment - both outputs address identical migration planning goals, use same cost calculations ($3.52 per run), same effort estimates (28 hours total), and identical technical approach for PySpark conversion. The documents demonstrate complete consistency in:

- Cost estimation methodology and calculations
- Effort breakdown for manual conversion areas
- Technical approach to PySpark migration
- Data volume processing estimates
- Databricks DBU cost projections

### Structural Similarity (Score: 100/100)

Identical document structure with same section numbering (1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing), same subsection organization (2.1 PySpark Runtime Cost), same bullet point hierarchy, and identical formatting patterns. The structural elements include:

- Consistent header formatting with author and description
- Identical section and subsection numbering
- Same bullet point organization and indentation
- Matching emphasis patterns with bold formatting
- Identical calculation presentation format

### Correctness

**Input1: 100/100** - Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent numbering, valid calculations, proper currency formatting, and no internal inconsistencies.

**Input2: 100/100** - Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent numbering, valid calculations, proper currency formatting, and no internal inconsistencies.

**Overall: 100/100** - Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntax-level correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural issues.

## Scoring Summary
