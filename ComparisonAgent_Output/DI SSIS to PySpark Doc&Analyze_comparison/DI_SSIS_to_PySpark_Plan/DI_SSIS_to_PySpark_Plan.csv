Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,100,"Lines 1-47","Both agent outputs are completely identical in content structure and formatting. They provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort planning for migrating SSIS Package EDW_BC_Load_DimBillingAccount to PySpark on GCP Databricks. Perfect semantic structural and syntactic alignment with no differences detected."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-47","Both outputs address identical goals: cost estimation ($3.52 per run) and effort estimation (28 hours total). Same data volume calculations (80GB total processed) same DBU consumption estimates (16 DBU-hours) and identical manual conversion areas listed. Perfect semantic alignment with no conceptual differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-47","Identical document structure: header block (lines 1-5) cost estimation section (lines 7-21) effort estimation section (lines 23-43) and footer (lines 45-47). Same numbering scheme bullet points formatting and section organization. Perfect structural match."
