Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Analysis cannot be completed due to missing agent outputs. The input contains placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} but no actual content to compare. This prevents semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Semantic similarity evaluation requires actual agent outputs to compare meanings, intent, and purpose. No content provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Structural similarity evaluation requires actual agent outputs to compare logical structure, flow, and decomposition. No content provided for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Role_Agent_Mapper_Agent1,0,N/A,"Correctness evaluation requires actual Agent 1 output to assess syntax validity and internal consistency. No content provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Role_Agent_Mapper_Agent2,0,N/A,"Correctness evaluation requires actual Agent 2 output to assess syntax validity and internal consistency. No content provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent output evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure outputs contain sufficient content for meaningful comparison. 3. Include context about the task or domain for better evaluation. 4. Specify expected output format (code, documentation, analysis, test cases) if known."
