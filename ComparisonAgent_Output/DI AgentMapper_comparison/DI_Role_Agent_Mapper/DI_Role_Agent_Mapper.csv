Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-24 vs 1-124,"Agent1_Chunk1 provides a focused subset of 24 agent mappings with identical CSV structure to Agent2_Complete, which contains 124 comprehensive agent mappings. Both serve the same semantic purpose of mapping data engineering agents to project phases, deliverables, and roles. Agent2_Complete demonstrates significantly broader coverage across the data engineering lifecycle, including specialized agents for various technologies (Fabric, Teradata, BigQuery, PowerBI, etc.). The structural approach is nearly identical, but Agent1_Chunk1 contains extraneous explanatory text that could impact parsing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-24 vs 1-124,"Both outputs address identical goals of agent-to-role mapping in data engineering projects. Agent1_Chunk1 covers core modeling and pipeline agents, while Agent2_Complete provides comprehensive coverage including planning, testing, documentation, and specialized technology agents. The semantic intent is perfectly aligned, but scope differs significantly - Agent2_Complete covers 5x more agents across broader lifecycle phases. Core agent types overlap substantially (Model Conceptual, Model Logical, DE Pipeline developers, etc.)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-24 vs 1-124,"Both outputs use identical CSV structure with 5 columns: AgentName, Phases, Deliverables, Roles, Map Confidence Score. Column headers match exactly. Data formatting approaches are consistent - semicolon-separated multi-values, pipe-separated roles, consistent confidence scoring (80-95 range). The logical decomposition and data organization patterns are nearly identical. Only difference is Agent1_Chunk1 includes explanatory text outside the CSV structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Chunk1,85,Lines 1-3 and 25-26,"Valid CSV syntax within the data block (lines 4-24). However, contains explanatory text before and after the CSV that could cause parsing errors in automated systems. The CSV portion itself is well-formed with proper escaping and consistent data types. Confidence scores are realistic (80-95 range). Agent names follow consistent naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Complete,98,Lines 1-124,"Excellent CSV formatting throughout with no extraneous text. All 124 rows properly formatted with consistent column structure. Confidence scores are realistic and well-distributed (80-95 range). Agent names follow consistent conventions. No syntax errors detected. Minor deduction for some very long agent names that could impact readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average of Agent1_Chunk1 (85) and Agent2_Complete (98) correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with Agent2_Complete showing superior formatting discipline."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Chunk1,N/A,Lines 1-3 and 25-26,"Remove explanatory text outside CSV structure to ensure clean parsing. Consider expanding agent coverage to match comprehensive scope seen in Agent2_Complete. The core 24 agents provide good foundation but represent only ~20% of full lifecycle coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Complete,N/A,Lines 1-124,"Excellent comprehensive coverage and formatting. Consider standardizing very long agent names for improved readability. The 124-agent scope provides excellent coverage across data engineering lifecycle phases. Maintain current formatting standards as best practice."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong alignment in core agent mapping approach. Agent2_Complete represents the more mature and comprehensive version. Recommend using Agent2_Complete structure and scope as the standard template for future agent mapping exercises. Consider implementing validation rules to prevent extraneous text in CSV outputs."
