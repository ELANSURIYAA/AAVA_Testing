Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two CSV files containing agent role mappings for data engineering projects. Agent 1 provides basic mapping for 25 agents, while Agent 2 offers comprehensive mapping for 115 agents with enhanced role definitions and broader coverage across data engineering lifecycle phases."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-25 vs Lines 1-115","Both outputs serve identical semantic purpose of mapping data engineering agents to roles, phases, and deliverables. Agent 2 significantly expands coverage with 90 additional agents while maintaining semantic consistency. Core agent mappings in Agent 1 are preserved and enhanced in Agent 2 with additional role specifications and phase coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Header row and all data rows","Both outputs follow identical CSV structure with same column schema (AgentName,Phases,Deliverables,Roles,Map Confidence Score). Data formatting, delimiter usage, and field structure are consistent. Only difference is volume - Agent 2 contains 4.6x more rows while maintaining structural integrity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,100,"Lines 1-26","Valid CSV syntax throughout. All fields properly formatted, no syntax errors, consistent delimiter usage, proper header row structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,100,"Lines 1-116","Valid CSV syntax throughout. All fields properly formatted, no syntax errors, consistent delimiter usage, proper header row structure. Enhanced role definitions use proper semicolon separators."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors or structural issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Consider expanding agent coverage to match comprehensive scope of Agent 2. Current 25-agent mapping covers core functionality but may be insufficient for enterprise-scale data engineering projects."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Excellent comprehensive coverage with 115 agents spanning full data engineering lifecycle. Consider adding confidence score justifications for scores below 90 to improve transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate high quality with perfect syntax. Agent 2 represents significant enhancement over Agent 1 with broader coverage while maintaining structural consistency. Recommend adopting Agent 2 approach for production use."
