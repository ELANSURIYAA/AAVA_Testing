Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion. Output_1 focuses on conversion accuracy and business logic preservation with concise recommendations. Output_2 delivers more detailed feature-by-feature comparison with tabular analysis and comprehensive test coverage discussion. Both maintain professional technical documentation standards and address the same core conversion validation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-50,"Both outputs address identical conversion validation goals with strong semantic alignment. Output_1 emphasizes conversion accuracy and business logic integrity (lines 7-15). Output_2 provides equivalent assessment with more granular feature mapping (lines 16-35). Minor divergence in emphasis: Output_1 focuses on operational traceability, Output_2 emphasizes security and maintainability aspects. Core semantic intent perfectly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-50,"Both follow standard technical review structure with conversion accuracy and recommendations sections. Output_1 uses simple enumerated format (lines 7-20). Output_2 employs more sophisticated organization with numbered sections, feature comparison table (lines 16-35), and detailed subsections. Output_2 includes explicit test coverage discussion absent in Output_1. Overall flow similar but structural complexity differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,1-25,"Well-formed technical documentation with proper section headers and consistent formatting. Minor issue: missing date field in header (line 3). All technical references accurate, bullet points properly formatted, recommendations clearly structured. No syntax errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,1-50,"Excellent technical documentation structure with comprehensive formatting. Proper use of markdown tables, numbered sections, and consistent header formatting. All technical references accurate and well-organized. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section (line 48). No syntax errors, all internal references valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness standards with proper technical documentation formatting and accurate content references. Average score reflects minor formatting issues but overall excellent syntactic quality."
