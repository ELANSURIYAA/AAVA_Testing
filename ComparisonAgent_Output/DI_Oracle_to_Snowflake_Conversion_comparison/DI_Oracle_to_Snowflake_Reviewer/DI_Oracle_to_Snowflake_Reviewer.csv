Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake conversion procedures. Agent 1 delivers a concise assessment focusing on conversion accuracy and business logic integrity. Agent 2 provides more detailed analysis with feature-by-feature comparison tables and extensive technical coverage. Both maintain professional documentation standards and address the same core conversion validation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 25-35","Both outputs address Oracle to Snowflake conversion review with similar intent. Agent 1 focuses on high-level conversion accuracy (lines 5-15) while Agent 2 provides granular feature comparison (lines 25-45). Both cover business logic integrity, audit logging, and recommendations. Semantic alignment is strong but Agent 2 provides deeper technical detail and systematic comparison methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-10, 20-30, 40-50","Both follow similar document structure: header with metadata, conversion accuracy section, overall assessment, and recommendations. Agent 1 uses numbered points and bullet structure (lines 8-25). Agent 2 employs detailed subsections with comparison tables (lines 30-60). Flow is comparable but Agent 2 has more sophisticated organization with feature matrices and systematic coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 1-50","Document is well-formed with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and coherent internal references. Minor formatting inconsistency in recommendation numbering (lines 45-48). All technical terms and concepts are accurately used. No broken references or syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-80","Highly structured document with consistent formatting, proper table syntax, and systematic organization. All section headers, bullet points, and technical references are correctly formatted. Feature comparison table is properly structured (lines 35-50). No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency."
