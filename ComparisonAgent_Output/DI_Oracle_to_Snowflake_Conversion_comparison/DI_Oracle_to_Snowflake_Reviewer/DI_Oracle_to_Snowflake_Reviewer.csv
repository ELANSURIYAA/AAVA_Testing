Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion. Agent_1 offers a concise assessment focusing on conversion accuracy and business logic preservation. Agent_2 provides a more detailed analysis with feature-by-feature comparison table and comprehensive testing coverage evaluation. Both conclude that the conversion accurately preserves functionality with similar recommendations for optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical conversion review goals and reach the same conclusions about conversion accuracy. Agent_1 focuses on high-level assessment while Agent_2 provides granular feature comparison. Both identify the same key conversion points: MERGE operations, timestamp handling, exception management, and audit logging. Minor divergence in depth of analysis but aligned in meaning and intent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-50,"Both follow similar document structure with Introduction, Conversion Accuracy, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. Agent_2 includes additional structured elements like numbered sections, feature comparison table (lines 15-35), and more detailed test coverage analysis. Agent_1 uses bullet points while Agent_2 uses numbered lists and tables for better organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-25,"Syntactically correct documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issue: missing date in header (line 3). All internal references are accurate and technical terminology is used correctly throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-60,"Highly structured and syntactically correct documentation. Comprehensive feature comparison table is well-formatted. All technical references are accurate. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section (line 58-60)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minimal formatting issues."
