Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) and moderate structural similarity (75/100). Output_1 provides a concise overview while Output_2 offers detailed feature-by-feature analysis with tabular comparison. Both demonstrate strong correctness in documentation format and technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Oracle to Snowflake procedure conversion accuracy. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both confirm successful conversion of MERGE operations and timestamp handling, (2) Both validate preservation of business logic and audit logging, (3) Both provide similar recommendations for clustering keys and error logging enhancement. Minor divergence in emphasis: Output_1 focuses on high-level assessment while Output_2 provides granular feature mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Conversion Accuracy, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. Key structural differences: Output_1 uses numbered points and bullet format (lines 8-15), while Output_2 employs detailed subsections with feature comparison table (lines 20-35). Output_2 includes additional sections like Test Coverage and Conclusion not present in Output_1. Flow logic is consistent but presentation depth varies significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 1-25,"Output_1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and coherent technical analysis. Minor issue: Missing date field in header (line 3). All technical references to Oracle/Snowflake features are accurate. Document structure is well-formed with clear section delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,Lines 1-50,"Output_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive formatting, detailed technical accuracy, and thorough documentation structure. All Oracle/Snowflake feature mappings are technically sound. Table formatting is proper and readable. Only minor issue: incomplete date field in header (line 3), but this is consistent with Output_1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy and proper documentation formatting with only minor header formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,Lines 20-25,"Enhance the analysis by adding more detailed feature mapping similar to Output_2's tabular approach. Consider expanding the testing section to match the comprehensive coverage described in Output_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Maintain the excellent level of detail and technical accuracy. Consider adding more concise executive summary points as seen in Output_1 for quick reference. The feature comparison table is exemplary and should be retained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Complete date fields in headers, (2) Standardized section numbering for consistency, (3) Cross-referencing between conversion accuracy findings and test coverage sections where applicable."
