Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversions with high semantic alignment (85/100) and strong structural similarity (78/100). Output_1 provides a concise overview while Output_2 delivers detailed technical analysis with feature-by-feature comparisons. Both maintain excellent syntactic correctness (95/100 average)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30 (Output_1), Lines 1-80 (Output_2)","Both outputs address Oracle to Snowflake conversion review with aligned intent. Output_1 focuses on high-level conversion accuracy and business logic preservation. Output_2 provides deeper technical analysis with feature-by-feature mapping. Both conclude with similar recommendations around clustering, error logging, and testing. Minor divergence in emphasis - Output_1 emphasizes performance optimization while Output_2 emphasizes maintainability and comprehensive testing coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 5-25 (Output_1), Lines 10-70 (Output_2)","Both follow similar logical flow: Conversion Accuracy → Overall Assessment → Recommendations. Output_2 provides more structured approach with numbered sections and detailed feature comparison table (lines 25-45). Output_1 uses bullet points for key findings while Output_2 uses comprehensive tabular analysis. Both conclude with practical recommendations but Output_2 includes additional sections on testing coverage and conclusion."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 1-30","Excellent syntactic correctness. Proper markdown formatting, consistent bullet point structure, coherent technical terminology. Minor issue: missing date field in header (line 3). All technical references are accurate and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,95,"Lines 1-80","Excellent syntactic correctness. Comprehensive structure with proper markdown formatting, detailed table formatting (lines 25-45), consistent numbering system. All technical references are accurate. Complete header information and proper conclusion section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate technical terminology, and coherent structure. Average score reflects consistently high quality across both outputs."
