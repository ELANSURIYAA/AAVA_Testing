Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion with high semantic alignment (92/100), similar structural approaches (88/100), and excellent syntactic correctness (95/100 average). Output_1 is more concise while Output_2 provides deeper technical analysis with detailed feature comparison tables."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-30 (Output_1), Lines 1-80 (Output_2)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Oracle to Snowflake procedure conversion accuracy, assessing business logic preservation, and providing recommendations. Output_2 provides more granular analysis with feature-by-feature comparison table (lines 25-45) while Output_1 focuses on high-level conversion points. Both conclude with similar assessments of successful conversion with preserved business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-25 (Output_1), Lines 10-70 (Output_2)","Both follow similar review structure: Conversion Accuracy → Overall Assessment → Recommendations. Output_1 uses numbered lists for organization while Output_2 employs detailed subsections and comparison tables. Both include cost tracking (line 30 Output_1, line 85 Output_2). Output_2 adds comprehensive feature comparison table and more detailed testing coverage analysis not present in Output_1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 1-30","Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and valid technical references. Minor issue: missing date field (line 3). All technical terms and procedure names are accurately referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,95,"Lines 1-90","Syntactically correct with comprehensive technical analysis. Proper markdown table formatting (lines 25-45), consistent technical terminology, and accurate procedure references. Minor issue: missing date field (line 3). All code snippets and technical details are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with only minor formatting inconsistencies. Technical content is accurate and well-structured."
