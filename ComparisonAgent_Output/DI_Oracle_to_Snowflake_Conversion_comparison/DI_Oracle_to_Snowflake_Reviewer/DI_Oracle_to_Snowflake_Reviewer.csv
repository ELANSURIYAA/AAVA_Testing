Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Oracle to Snowflake procedure conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) covering conversion accuracy business logic integrity and recommendations. Structural organization differs slightly with Output 1 using numbered sections and Output 2 using detailed feature comparison tables. Both demonstrate strong syntactic correctness as documentation artifacts."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion for agent data loading. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Conversion accuracy assessment covering MERGE operations SYSTIMESTAMP to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP mapping and exception handling (Lines 5-15 both outputs) (2) Business logic integrity validation ensuring upsert functionality and audit logging preservation (Lines 20-30 both outputs) (3) Performance and optimization recommendations including clustering keys and error logging enhancements (Lines 35-45 both outputs). Minor semantic differences: Output 1 focuses more on high-level assessment while Output 2 provides granular feature-by-feature comparison table (Lines 15-25 Output 2)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with introduction conversion accuracy assessment overall assessment and recommendations sections. Key structural differences: (1) Output 1 uses numbered bullet points for organization (Lines 8-12 15-18 25-28) while Output 2 uses detailed subsections with feature comparison table (Lines 10-30) (2) Output 2 includes comprehensive tabular comparison of Oracle vs Snowflake features (Lines 15-25) absent in Output 1 (3) Output 1 has more concise section organization while Output 2 provides expanded technical detail sections. Both maintain logical flow from conversion analysis to assessment to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Oracle_to_Snowflake_Output1,95,Lines 1-50,"Output 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness as documentation: (1) Proper markdown formatting with consistent header structure (2) Accurate technical terminology for Oracle and Snowflake features (3) Coherent sentence structure and grammar throughout (4) Consistent bullet point formatting (Lines 8-12 15-18 25-28) (5) Minor issue: Missing date field in header (Line 3) reduces completeness score by 5 points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Oracle_to_Snowflake_Output2,98,Lines 1-50,"Output 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness: (1) Complete header with all required fields including author and description (Lines 1-4) (2) Well-structured markdown with proper section hierarchy (3) Accurate technical content with detailed feature comparison table (Lines 15-25) (4) Consistent formatting throughout document (5) Proper use of technical terminology and syntax (6) Comprehensive coverage with no apparent syntactic errors. Minor deduction of 2 points for slightly verbose structure that could impact readability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,Lines 1-50,"Average correctness score of 96.5 indicates both outputs maintain high syntactic quality as documentation artifacts with minor formatting and completeness variations."
