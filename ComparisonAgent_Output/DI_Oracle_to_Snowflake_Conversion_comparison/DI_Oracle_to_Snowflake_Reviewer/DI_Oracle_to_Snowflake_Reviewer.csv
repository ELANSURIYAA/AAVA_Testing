Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Oracle to Snowflake procedure conversion with high semantic alignment (95/100) and good structural similarity (75/100). Agent 2 delivers more detailed analysis with feature comparison table while Agent 1 provides concise assessment. Both reach consistent conclusions about conversion accuracy and business logic preservation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 5-15, 25-35","Both outputs address identical core objective: reviewing Oracle to Snowflake stored procedure conversion accuracy. Agent 1 focuses on MERGE operation conversion, timestamp handling, and exception handling. Agent 2 provides comprehensive feature-by-feature comparison table covering same elements plus additional details like commit handling and variable assignment. Both conclude conversion preserves business logic and data integrity. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent 1 highlights performance optimization while Agent 2 emphasizes maintainability and testing coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50","Agent 1 structure: Header → Conversion Accuracy (3 points) → Overall Assessment (3 points) → Recommendations (3 points) → API Cost. Agent 2 structure: Header → Conversion Accuracy (detailed feature table + test coverage) → Overall Assessment (6 detailed points) → Recommendations (6 points) → API Cost + Conclusion. Both follow logical progression but Agent 2 includes structured comparison table (lines 15-35) and more granular subsections. Same overall flow with different levels of detail and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_1,98,"Line 3","Well-formed document with consistent formatting and valid structure. Minor issue: incomplete date field in header (shows '[Insert Date]' placeholder rather than actual date). All other elements properly formatted including bullet points, section headers, and cost information."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_2,100,,"Complete, well-structured document with no syntax issues. All sections properly formatted, comparison table correctly structured, bullet points consistent, and all fields completed including proper date handling and comprehensive conclusion section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"High overall correctness with minor date field issue in Agent 1. Both documents demonstrate strong internal consistency and proper formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_1,,"Lines 40-47","Complete date field in document header. Consider expanding error logging recommendations with specific diagnostic examples. Maintain concise format while ensuring all procedural aspects are covered."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_2,,"Lines 45-55","Excellent comprehensive analysis approach. Consider adding estimated effort or timeline for implementing clustering recommendations. Maintain detailed feature comparison methodology for future conversions."
