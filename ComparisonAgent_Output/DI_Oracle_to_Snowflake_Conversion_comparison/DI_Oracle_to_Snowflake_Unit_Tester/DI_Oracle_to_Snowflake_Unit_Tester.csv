Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest scripts for testing Snowflake stored procedures that load agent data from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D with audit logging. Agent_Basic provides 6 test cases with basic implementation, while Agent_Comprehensive provides 10 test cases with more detailed parameterized testing approach. Key differences include test case coverage, implementation sophistication, and error handling robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 60-120","Both outputs address the identical core objective of testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure. They cover overlapping test scenarios including successful execution (TC001/TC01), empty staging table (TC002/TC04), null value handling (TC003/TC03), and error scenarios (TC004/TC06-TC07). Agent_Comprehensive extends coverage with boundary testing (TC08), duplicate handling (TC09), and long string testing (TC10). The semantic intent and business logic understanding are highly aligned with minor differences in test scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 51-150","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by pytest implementation. However, Agent_Basic uses a simple numbered list format while Agent_Comprehensive uses a professional tabular format for test cases. The pytest implementations differ significantly - Agent_Basic uses individual test functions (lines 60-150) while Agent_Comprehensive uses parameterized testing with helper functions (lines 80-140). Control flow and organization approaches vary substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Basic,70,"Lines 65, 85, 110, 135","Several syntax and implementation issues: Line 65 - hardcoded connection parameters without proper configuration management; Line 85 - incomplete assertion logic for audit log validation; Line 110 - missing proper cleanup between tests; Line 135 - error handling test drops table but recreation logic may fail in concurrent environments. The pytest structure is functional but lacks robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive,90,"Lines 95, 125","Well-structured implementation with minor issues: Line 95 - connection parameters still hardcoded but better organized; Line 125 - parameterized test approach is more maintainable. The code includes proper helper functions, comprehensive test coverage, and better error handling. Only minor improvements needed in configuration management and test isolation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,80,,"Average of individual agent scores. Agent_Basic shows functional but basic implementation while Agent_Comprehensive demonstrates professional-grade test automation practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Basic,,"Lines 60-150","Implement parameterized testing to reduce code duplication; Add proper configuration management for database connections; Improve test isolation and cleanup procedures; Enhance error handling and assertion logic; Consider adding boundary and edge case testing similar to Agent_Comprehensive."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive,,"Lines 80-140","Externalize database connection configuration; Add more comprehensive documentation for test setup requirements; Consider adding performance testing scenarios; Implement test data factories for better test maintainability; Add integration with CI/CD pipeline configuration."
