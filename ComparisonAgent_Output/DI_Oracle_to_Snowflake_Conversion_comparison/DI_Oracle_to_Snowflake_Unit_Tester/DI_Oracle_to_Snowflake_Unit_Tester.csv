Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Snowflake procedure. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage with 10 test cases vs 6, better organization with tabular format, and more sophisticated pytest implementation using parameterization. Agent 1 provides solid foundational testing but lacks edge cases and advanced pytest features. Both outputs are syntactically correct and address the core testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 60-150","Both outputs target the same LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure with similar core test scenarios (successful execution, empty stage, null handling, error cases). Agent 2 expands significantly with boundary testing, duplicate handling, and comprehensive edge cases that Agent 1 lacks. The fundamental testing intent aligns well but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of comprehensive test coverage requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 51-150","Agent 1 uses traditional individual test functions while Agent 2 employs pytest parameterization and helper functions for better code organization. Both follow pytest conventions but Agent 2 shows more sophisticated structure with setup/teardown helpers, parameterized tests, and better separation of concerns. The overall flow differs significantly in implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 45, 67, 89","Minor syntax issues: missing connection configuration validation, potential resource cleanup issues in fixture scope, and incomplete error assertion patterns. The pytest structure is generally sound but lacks some best practices for database testing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 125","Excellent syntax with proper parameterization, comprehensive helper functions, and robust error handling. Minor issue with hardcoded string lengths (line 125) that could be made configurable. Overall demonstrates advanced pytest patterns and best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with Agent 2 showing superior implementation quality and Agent 1 having minor structural improvements needed."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 20-40","Expand test case coverage to include boundary conditions, duplicate handling, and performance scenarios. Implement helper functions for better code organization and consider parameterized testing for similar test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 100-120","Consider adding performance and concurrency tests. Make string length constants configurable rather than hardcoded. Add more detailed assertion messages for better test failure diagnosis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs would benefit from integration with CI/CD pipelines, addition of test data factories, and implementation of test result reporting mechanisms. Consider adding mock scenarios for external dependencies."
