Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide unit test specifications and pytest implementations for the Snowflake LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage with 10 comprehensive test cases versus Agent 1's 6 cases, better code organization with helper functions and parametrized tests, and more robust error handling. Agent 1 has several syntax issues and incomplete implementations while Agent 2 provides production-ready test code with proper fixtures and comprehensive edge case coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs target the same core objective of testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure with similar test scenarios including successful execution, empty tables, NULL handling, and error cases. Agent 2 expands the scope with additional boundary testing and duplicate handling that Agent 1 lacks, but the fundamental intent and approach are well-aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,,"Agent 1 uses a simpler structure with individual test functions and basic setup/teardown. Agent 2 employs a more sophisticated approach with parametrized tests, helper functions, and proper fixtures. Both follow pytest conventions but Agent 2 demonstrates better code organization and reusability patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,75,"Lines 45, 52, 89, 95","Agent 1 has several syntax and logical issues: missing proper connection cleanup in fixture (line 45), inconsistent assertion patterns (line 52), incomplete error handling test that drops tables without proper restoration (line 89), and missing parametrization for comprehensive testing (line 95)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,Line 127,"Agent 2 has minimal issues with one potential problem in the duplicate test case handling (line 127) where the expected behavior could be more clearly defined, but otherwise demonstrates excellent syntax, proper exception handling, and comprehensive test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,,"Average of Agent 1 (75) and Agent 2 (95) scores. Agent 2 significantly outperforms Agent 1 in correctness with better syntax, error handling, and test completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 45-50, 89-95","Agent 1 should implement proper connection management with try/finally blocks, add comprehensive parametrized testing, improve error handling test cases to avoid destructive operations, and expand test coverage to match industry standards for database testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,Line 127,"Agent 2 should clarify the expected behavior for duplicate AGENT_ID scenarios and consider adding more explicit documentation for the parametrized test cases to improve maintainability."
