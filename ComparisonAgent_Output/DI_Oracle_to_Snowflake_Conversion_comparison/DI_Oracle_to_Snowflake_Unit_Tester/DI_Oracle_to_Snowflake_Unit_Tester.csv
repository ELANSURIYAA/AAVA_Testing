Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide unit test specifications for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Snowflake procedure. Agent2 delivers more comprehensive test coverage with 10 test cases vs Agent1's 6 cases, better code organization with parameterized tests, and professional documentation formatting. Agent1 provides a solid foundation but lacks some edge cases and has minor structural issues."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"","Both outputs address the core testing requirements for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure. Agent1 covers fundamental scenarios (lines 7-24) while Agent2 expands with additional edge cases (lines 11-20 in table). Both validate successful execution, empty tables, NULL handling, and error scenarios. Agent2 adds boundary testing, duplicate handling, and string length validation that Agent1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Agent1 uses a simple numbered list for test cases (lines 7-24) and basic pytest functions (lines 45-120). Agent2 employs a professional table format (lines 11-20) and sophisticated parameterized testing (lines 67-110). Both follow logical test organization but Agent2 demonstrates superior structural design with helper functions and better separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,78,"Lines 52, 67, 82, 97","Agent1 has several syntax and structural issues: hardcoded connection parameters (line 52), missing proper test isolation, and basic assertion patterns. The code structure is functional but lacks robustness in setup/teardown and error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,"Lines 45-50, 89","Agent2 demonstrates superior code quality with proper helper functions (lines 45-50), parameterized testing, and comprehensive error handling. Minor issues include placeholder connection parameters (line 89) but overall structure is production-ready."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,"","Average correctness score reflecting Agent1's functional but basic implementation versus Agent2's robust, well-structured approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,"","Improve code structure by implementing helper functions, add parameterized testing for better maintainability, include additional edge cases like boundary values and duplicate handling, and implement proper test isolation with setup/teardown methods."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,"","Address placeholder connection parameters, consider adding more detailed inline documentation, and ensure all edge cases have corresponding implementation validation in the actual stored procedure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"","Agent2 provides the superior solution with comprehensive test coverage and professional code structure. Agent1 could benefit from adopting Agent2's parameterized testing approach and table-formatted documentation style."
