# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Snowflake procedure. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage with 10 test cases versus Agent 1's 6, includes parametrized testing for better maintainability, and provides more robust error handling. Agent 1 offers a simpler approach but lacks comprehensive boundary testing and has some structural limitations. Overall similarity is high with Agent 2 providing enhanced testing practices.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs target the same core objective of testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure. They cover similar fundamental scenarios including successful execution, empty table handling, NULL value processing, and error conditions. Agent 2 extends coverage with boundary testing (lines 45-47), duplicate handling (line 48), and string length validation (line 49-51), providing more comprehensive semantic coverage. The testing intent and validation approaches are highly aligned.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. Key structural differences: Agent 1 uses individual test functions (lines 25-85) while Agent 2 employs parametrized testing (lines 52-85) which is more maintainable. Agent 2 includes helper functions for setup (lines 15-30) providing better code organization. Both use similar fixture patterns and connection management approaches.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 78/100):** Syntax is generally correct but has several issues: Missing proper connection parameter handling in fixture (lines 30-32), incomplete error assertion in test_error_handling (lines 65-67), and potential issues with table recreation logic (lines 45-47). The overall structure is sound but lacks robust error handling patterns.

**Agent 2 (Score: 92/100):** Highly syntactically correct with proper parametrization, comprehensive helper functions, and robust error handling. Minor issues include potential connection parameter exposure (lines 85-90) and some assumptions about table structure in error scenarios (lines 95-100). The parametrized approach and helper functions demonstrate advanced pytest practices.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 85/100):** Average correctness score reflecting Agent 1's basic correctness with some structural issues and Agent 2's superior implementation with advanced testing patterns and minimal syntax concerns.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 78 | 92 | 85 |
| **Overall** | **79** | **84** | **82** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:** Enhance test coverage by adding boundary testing and edge cases. Implement parametrized testing for better maintainability. Improve error handling assertions and add comprehensive helper functions for test setup and validation.

**For Agent 2:** Secure connection parameters by using environment variables or configuration files instead of hardcoded placeholders. Consider adding more detailed assertions for complex scenarios and enhance documentation for parametrized test cases.
