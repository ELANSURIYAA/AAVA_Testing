Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test documentation and pytest scripts for Snowflake stored procedures. Agent_1_Output focuses on basic test case documentation with a straightforward pytest implementation, while Agent_2_Output provides a more structured approach with tabular test case format and enhanced error handling. The outputs share the same fundamental goal of testing LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure but differ significantly in presentation format, test coverage depth, and implementation sophistication."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Snowflake procedure for data migration from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D with audit logging. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Testing successful data insertion/updates, (2) Handling empty source tables, (3) Managing NULL values, (4) Error handling scenarios, (5) Audit log validation. Minor semantic differences exist in test case granularity and edge case coverage, with Agent_2_Output providing more comprehensive boundary testing scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,N/A,"Structural differences are notable between the outputs. Agent_1_Output uses a traditional numbered list format for test cases (lines 8-78) followed by a pytest script (lines 82-150). Agent_2_Output employs a tabular format for test case documentation (lines 8-18) with more sophisticated pytest implementation including parameterized tests (lines 45-85). Both follow the same high-level structure: test case documentation followed by pytest implementation, but Agent_2_Output demonstrates superior organization with tabular presentation and advanced pytest features."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,92,Lines 82-150,"Agent_1_Output pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixture definitions, and test functions. Minor issues: (1) Hardcoded connection parameters without environment variable handling (lines 95-102), (2) Basic assertion patterns without comprehensive error checking, (3) Limited cleanup procedures. The test logic is sound and executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,88,Lines 20-120,"Agent_2_Output pytest script demonstrates advanced patterns but has some issues: (1) Parameterized test setup is well-structured (lines 45-85), (2) Helper functions provide good abstraction (lines 25-43), (3) Error handling tests are more comprehensive (lines 87-120). Issues include: potential parameter binding problems in setup functions (lines 30-40) and missing table recreation logic in some error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90/100. Both outputs demonstrate solid technical implementation with proper pytest structure, Snowflake connector usage, and test logic. Agent_1_Output provides reliable basic implementation while Agent_2_Output shows advanced testing patterns with minor technical refinements needed."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 95-102,"Enhance connection management by implementing environment variables for credentials instead of hardcoded values. Add more comprehensive cleanup procedures and improve error assertion patterns for production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 30-40,"Review parameter binding in helper functions to ensure proper SQL injection prevention. Enhance table recreation logic in error handling scenarios and consider adding more granular assertions for complex test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Standardized configuration management, (2) Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities, (3) Integration with CI/CD pipelines, (4) Performance benchmarking for large datasets, (5) Cross-environment compatibility testing."
