Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive test documentation for Oracle-to-Snowflake stored procedure validation. Agent 1 provided 6 test cases in narrative format with a functional pytest script. Agent 2 provided 10 test cases in structured table format with a more detailed pytest script including parameterized tests. Both outputs are syntactically correct and address the core testing requirements with good coverage of happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs target the same core objective: testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure for data migration from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D with audit logging. Agent 1 covers 6 fundamental scenarios while Agent 2 expands to 10 scenarios with additional boundary testing. Both include similar core test cases: successful execution, empty tables, NULL handling, error scenarios, and duplicate handling. The semantic intent and business logic understanding are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"","Agent 1 uses narrative test case format with numbered sections and descriptive text (lines 8-78), while Agent 2 employs structured table format with clear columns (lines 8-19). Both include pytest scripts but with different approaches: Agent 1 uses individual test functions (lines 80-180), Agent 2 uses parameterized testing with helper functions (lines 21-140). The overall flow is similar but presentation and organization differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 80-180","Agent 1 pytest script has proper Python syntax, correct imports, valid fixture definition, and well-structured test functions. Minor issue: hardcoded connection parameters need to be replaced (lines 95-102). All test assertions and SQL queries are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 21-140","Agent 2 pytest script demonstrates superior structure with helper functions, parameterized tests, and comprehensive error handling. Excellent use of pytest fixtures and proper exception handling. Very minor issue: some long string literals could be better formatted (line 85)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, valid SQL queries, and consistent internal references. Agent 2 shows slightly better code organization and error handling practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,"","","Consider adopting table format for test cases to improve readability and maintenance. Implement parameterized testing approach for better test coverage and reduced code duplication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,"","","Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding more descriptive comments in pytest script for complex test scenarios. The table format and parameterized testing approach should be adopted as best practice."
