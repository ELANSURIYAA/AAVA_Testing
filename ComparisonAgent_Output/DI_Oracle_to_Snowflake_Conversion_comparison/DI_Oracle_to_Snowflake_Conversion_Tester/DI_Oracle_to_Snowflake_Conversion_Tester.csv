Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test documentation for Oracle-to-Snowflake stored procedure conversion. Agent 1 delivers 6 test cases in narrative format with a functional Pytest script. Agent 2 provides 10 test cases in structured tabular format with advanced parametrized testing. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of testing requirements with high semantic alignment (88/100) and good structural approaches (75/100). Agent 2 shows superior organization and coverage while Agent 1 provides clearer narrative descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core testing objectives: validating Snowflake stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS for agent data upsert operations. Common test scenarios include successful execution, empty staging tables, NULL value handling, error conditions, duplicate records, and audit logging validation. Agent 2 expands coverage with boundary testing (TC08, TC10) and additional edge cases. Minor semantic differences in test case naming conventions and description styles."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-45 (Agent 1), Lines 10-25 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses numbered list format (TC001-TC006) with detailed narrative descriptions per test case. Agent 2 employs tabular structure with standardized columns (Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, etc.). Pytest implementations differ significantly: Agent 1 uses individual test functions, Agent 2 leverages parametrized testing with @pytest.mark.parametrize. Both follow logical test organization but with different structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,92,"Lines 51-120","Python syntax is valid with proper imports, fixture definitions, and test function structure. Minor issues: hardcoded connection parameters (lines 58-65), missing error handling for connection failures, and some assertions could be more specific (line 85). Overall well-formed Pytest code with appropriate Snowflake connector usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 61-150","Excellent Python syntax with advanced Pytest features including parametrized testing, proper fixture scope management, and comprehensive helper functions. Well-structured test data setup and teardown. Minor improvement areas: connection parameter handling and some exception handling could be more granular (lines 140-145). Superior code organization and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python code, proper imports, and appropriate testing frameworks. Agent 2 shows slightly better code quality with advanced testing patterns and better organization. No critical syntax errors in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance test case organization by adopting tabular format for better readability and standardization. Consider implementing parametrized testing to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. Add boundary testing scenarios for comprehensive coverage. Improve connection parameter management with environment variables or configuration files."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Maintain excellent structural approach and comprehensive test coverage. Consider adding more detailed narrative descriptions for complex test scenarios to improve documentation clarity. Enhance error handling granularity in exception testing. Consider adding performance testing scenarios for large data volumes."
