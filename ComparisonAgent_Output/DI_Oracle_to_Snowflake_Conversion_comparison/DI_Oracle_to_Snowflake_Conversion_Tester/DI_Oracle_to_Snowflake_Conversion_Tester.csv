Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest scripts for validating Snowflake stored procedures that load agent data from staging to target tables. Agent_1 uses a traditional numbered list format for test cases while Agent_2 employs a structured table format. Both cover similar functional scenarios including happy path testing, edge cases with NULL values and empty tables, error handling, and boundary conditions. The pytest implementations are functionally equivalent with minor structural differences in helper function organization and parameterization approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-150 (Agent_1), Lines 1-120 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address identical testing objectives for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure. They cover the same core test scenarios: successful execution with valid data, empty staging table handling, NULL value processing, error conditions, duplicate handling, and boundary testing. The semantic intent and coverage are highly aligned with only minor differences in test case naming and organization. Agent_1 provides 6 detailed test cases while Agent_2 provides 10 test cases with more granular coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-80 (Agent_1), Lines 10-50 (Agent_2)","Agent_1 uses a numbered list format for test case documentation with detailed descriptions, while Agent_2 uses a structured table format with columns for Test Case ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Steps, Expected Result, etc. Both follow the pattern of test documentation followed by pytest script implementation. The pytest scripts have similar overall structure but differ in helper function organization - Agent_2 uses more modular helper functions and parameterized testing approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 85-150","Python syntax is valid with proper pytest structure. Snowflake connection setup is correct. Test functions are well-formed with appropriate assertions. Minor issue: hardcoded connection parameters need to be replaced with actual values (lines 95-102). All SQL queries are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 60-120","Python syntax is excellent with proper pytest fixtures and parameterized testing. Helper functions are well-structured and reusable. Connection handling is robust. Only minor issue: placeholder connection parameters need actual values (lines 70-77). SQL syntax is correct throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python pytest code and proper SQL syntax. Agent_2 shows slightly better code organization and testing practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider adopting a more structured table format for test case documentation as shown in Agent_2. Implement parameterized testing to reduce code duplication. Add more granular test cases for comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent structure and implementation. Consider adding more detailed descriptions in test case documentation. Ensure all placeholder connection parameters are properly configured for actual testing environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for testing the Snowflake stored procedure. Agent_2 demonstrates superior code organization and testing practices, while Agent_1 provides more detailed test case descriptions. A hybrid approach combining Agent_2's structure with Agent_1's detailed documentation would be optimal."
