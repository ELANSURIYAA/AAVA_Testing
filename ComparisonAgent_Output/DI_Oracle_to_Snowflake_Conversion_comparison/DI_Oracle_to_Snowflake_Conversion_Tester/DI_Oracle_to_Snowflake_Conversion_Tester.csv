Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest scripts for Snowflake procedure testing. Agent_2 demonstrates superior coverage with 10 test cases vs 6, better structure with tabular format, and more sophisticated pytest implementation using parametrized tests. Agent_1 provides solid foundational testing but lacks edge cases and advanced pytest features. Both outputs are syntactically correct and address the core testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent_1), Lines 1-200 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure. They cover similar fundamental scenarios: successful execution, empty tables, NULL handling, and error conditions. However, Agent_2 expands the scope with additional edge cases (boundary values, duplicate handling, long strings) and more comprehensive error scenarios. The semantic intent aligns strongly on core functionality testing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Lines 10-80 (Agent_1), Lines 15-25 (Agent_2)","Agent_1 uses a narrative format with numbered test cases, while Agent_2 employs a tabular structure. Both follow logical test case organization but with different presentation approaches. The pytest scripts show more structural divergence - Agent_1 uses individual test functions while Agent_2 leverages parametrized testing for better maintainability. Overall flow is similar but implementation patterns differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 85-150","Python syntax is correct, proper pytest structure, valid Snowflake connector usage. Minor issue: hardcoded connection parameters without proper configuration management. All imports, function definitions, and test assertions are syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 50-200","Excellent Python syntax, proper use of pytest fixtures and parametrization. Better error handling and connection management. Minor issue: some test scenarios may need adjustment for actual Snowflake behavior (line 180-185 duplicate handling)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python/pytest structure and valid Snowflake integration patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance test coverage by adding boundary value testing, duplicate handling scenarios, and long string validation. Consider adopting tabular format for better readability and parametrized testing for maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Validate duplicate AGENT_ID handling logic against actual Snowflake behavior. Consider adding more detailed test step documentation similar to Agent_1's narrative approach for better test case understanding."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents should implement proper configuration management for database connections, add performance testing scenarios, and include data validation assertions beyond basic existence checks."
