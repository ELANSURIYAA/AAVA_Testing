Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for Snowflake stored procedure validation with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent 2 demonstrates superior organization with tabular test case format, more comprehensive coverage (10 vs 6 test cases), and advanced pytest features including parameterization. Agent 1 provides solid foundational testing but with less systematic organization and coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure functionality. They cover similar scenarios including successful execution, empty tables, NULL handling, and error conditions. Agent 2 expands coverage with boundary testing, duplicate handling, and long string validation. The semantic intent is highly aligned with Agent 2 providing more comprehensive coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (test cases), Lines 51-150 (pytest) for Agent 1; Lines 1-80 (test cases), Lines 81-200 (pytest) for Agent 2","Agent 1 uses narrative test case format while Agent 2 uses tabular format. Both follow test case -> pytest script structure. Agent 2 demonstrates superior organization with helper functions, parameterized tests, and cleaner separation of concerns. The overall flow is similar but implementation approaches differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,88,"Lines 51-150","Pytest script has valid syntax and proper structure. Minor issues: hardcoded connection parameters (lines 15-22), basic test structure without advanced features, limited error handling scenarios. Test logic is sound but could be more robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 81-200","Excellent pytest implementation with proper fixtures, parameterized tests, helper functions, and comprehensive error handling. Minor issue: placeholder connection parameters (lines 45-52) need actual values. Superior code organization and testing patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with valid syntax and logical test structures. Agent 2 shows superior implementation quality with advanced pytest features and better code organization."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance test case organization by adopting tabular format for better readability and tracking. Expand test coverage to include boundary conditions, duplicate handling, and performance scenarios. Implement parameterized tests and helper functions for better code maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Replace placeholder connection parameters with actual configuration management. Consider adding performance and load testing scenarios. Document test data setup and teardown procedures more explicitly. Add integration test scenarios beyond unit testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Configuration management for database connections, 2) Test data management strategies, 3) Continuous integration setup documentation, 4) Performance benchmarking capabilities, 5) Cross-environment testing procedures."
