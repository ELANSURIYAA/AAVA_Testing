Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test documentation and Pytest scripts for validating the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Snowflake stored procedure. Agent 1 delivers 6 test cases in descriptive format with a functional Pytest implementation, while Agent 2 provides 10 test cases in structured table format with more advanced Pytest features including parameterized tests and comprehensive error handling. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with high semantic alignment (85/100) and good structural similarity (78/100) despite format differences. Correctness scores are excellent for both agents (95/100 and 92/100 respectively)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs target the identical objective of testing the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS stored procedure with overlapping test scenarios including successful execution, empty staging tables, NULL value handling, error conditions, and duplicate handling. Agent 1 covers 6 core scenarios while Agent 2 expands to 10 scenarios including boundary testing and long string validation. The semantic intent and business logic understanding are highly aligned, with Agent 2 providing more comprehensive edge case coverage. Minor divergence in test case naming conventions (TC001 vs TC01) and scope breadth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Structural approaches differ significantly in presentation but maintain similar logical decomposition. Agent 1 uses sequential numbered test case format with separate Pytest script, while Agent 2 employs tabular test case documentation with more sophisticated Pytest structure including parameterized tests and fixtures. Both follow standard test documentation patterns with preconditions, test steps, and expected results. Agent 2 demonstrates more advanced Python testing patterns with @pytest.mark.parametrize decorators and comprehensive helper functions. Flow logic remains consistent across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45, 67, 89","Python syntax is valid with proper import statements, fixture definitions, and test function structure. Minor issues: Line 45 - connection parameters use placeholder values that need replacement; Line 67 - assertion logic assumes specific return message format; Line 89 - table recreation logic could be more robust. Overall excellent code quality with proper Snowflake connector usage and pytest conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 78, 125, 156","Python syntax is valid with advanced pytest features properly implemented. Minor issues: Line 78 - parameterized test data structure could benefit from more explicit type annotations; Line 125 - exception handling in error tests assumes specific exception types; Line 156 - table recreation logic in cleanup could be more comprehensive. Excellent use of parameterized tests and helper functions demonstrates strong Python testing expertise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python code, proper import statements, and adherence to pytest conventions. Agent 1 provides solid foundational testing structure while Agent 2 showcases more advanced testing patterns. Minor improvements needed in connection parameter handling and error condition specificity for both agents. Overall excellent technical implementation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"1. Expand test coverage to include boundary conditions and edge cases similar to Agent 2's approach (lines 1-30). 2. Consider implementing parameterized tests to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability (lines 45-120). 3. Add more robust error handling and cleanup procedures in test setup/teardown (lines 89-95). 4. Include additional test scenarios for long string handling and boundary value testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"1. Consider adding more descriptive test case documentation format similar to Agent 1's detailed step-by-step approach (lines 1-40). 2. Enhance error message validation to be more specific about expected error types and messages (lines 125-140). 3. Add explicit type hints for better code maintainability and IDE support (lines 50-80). 4. Consider adding performance testing scenarios for large dataset handling."
