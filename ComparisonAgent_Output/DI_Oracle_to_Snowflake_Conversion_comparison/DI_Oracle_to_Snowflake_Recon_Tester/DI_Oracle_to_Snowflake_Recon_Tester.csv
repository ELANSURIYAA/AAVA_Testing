Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-156 vs 1-400+","Both outputs are Python scripts for Oracle to Snowflake migration with data validation. Agent 1 provides a basic implementation with core functionality, while Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with advanced features, better error handling, and detailed reporting capabilities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-156 vs 1-400+","Both scripts address the same core objective of migrating data from Oracle to Snowflake via Azure ADLS with validation. Agent 1 focuses on basic migration workflow while Agent 2 extends this with comprehensive validation, reporting, and enterprise features. The semantic intent is highly aligned but Agent 2 provides significantly more depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-156 vs 1-400+","Both follow similar high-level structure: imports, configuration, connection functions, execution steps, and main function. However, Agent 2 has more sophisticated organization with clear section headers, utility functions, and modular design. Agent 1 uses simpler linear approach while Agent 2 employs enterprise patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+,92,"Lines 15-20, 85-90","Minor issues: Line 85 uses os.system() for Azure CLI which lacks proper error handling and security validation. Line 20 missing error handling for environment variable validation. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper imports and function definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+,98,"Lines 1-400+","Excellent syntax and structure. Comprehensive error handling, proper exception management, secure credential handling via environment variables. Minor deduction for potential issues with tempfile cleanup in main() function around line 380."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+,,"Lines 85-90, 15-20","Replace os.system() Azure CLI calls with proper Azure SDK integration for better error handling and security. Add environment variable validation at startup. Consider adding connection pooling for better performance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+,,"Lines 380-390","Add explicit tempfile cleanup in finally block. Consider adding progress reporting for large table exports. The comprehensive approach is excellent for enterprise use."
