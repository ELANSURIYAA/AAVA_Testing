Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide Python scripts for Oracle to Snowflake migration with data validation. Agent 2 (Comprehensive Script) offers significantly more robust architecture with enhanced error handling, security, performance optimization, and detailed reporting capabilities compared to Agent 1 (Basic Script)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Both scripts address the same core migration task: executing Oracle procedures, exporting data, transferring to Azure ADLS, creating Snowflake external tables, and validating results. Agent 2 expands the scope with comprehensive logging, batch processing, detailed comparison logic, and report generation. The fundamental intent and workflow are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 15-140 vs 50-350","Both follow similar high-level structure with connection functions, export functions, and main execution flow. Agent 2 introduces significant structural enhancements including utility functions (lines 50-70), comprehensive configuration section (lines 20-40), detailed comparison logic (lines 250-300), and modular report generation (lines 320-350). The core workflow remains structurally similar but Agent 2 adds substantial architectural depth."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+ Basic Script,88,"Lines 45, 67, 89","Minor syntax issues: Line 45 uses os.system() for Azure CLI without proper error handling, Line 67 has potential SQL injection vulnerability in dynamic query construction, Line 89 uses basic string formatting that could fail with special characters. Overall structure is syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+ Comprehensive Script,95,"Lines 120, 180","Excellent syntax and structure. Minor issues: Line 120 has a potential encoding issue with CSV writer that could fail on special characters, Line 180 uses f-string in SQL generation that should use parameterized queries for security. Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92. Both scripts are syntactically sound with Agent 2 showing superior error handling and security practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+ Basic Script,,"Enhance error handling throughout the script, implement proper parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, replace os.system() calls with proper Azure SDK usage, add comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, implement data validation and comparison logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+ Comprehensive Script,,"Address minor encoding issues in CSV processing, implement parameterized queries for all dynamic SQL generation, consider adding progress tracking for large dataset processing, enhance the schema mapping to be more dynamic and configurable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Agent 2 (Comprehensive Script) is significantly more production-ready with better architecture, security, and maintainability. Agent 1 (Basic Script) serves as a good starting point but requires substantial enhancements for enterprise use. Consider adopting Agent 2's approach with the recommended improvements for optimal results."
