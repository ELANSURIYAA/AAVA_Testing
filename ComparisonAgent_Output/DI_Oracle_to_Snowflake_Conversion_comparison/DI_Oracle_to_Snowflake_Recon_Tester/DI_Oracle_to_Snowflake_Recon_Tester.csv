Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two Oracle to Snowflake migration Python scripts. Simple_Migration_Script provides basic migration functionality with standard error handling and logging. Comprehensive_Migration_Script offers enterprise-grade solution with advanced validation, detailed reporting, comprehensive error handling, and production-ready features. Both scripts are syntactically correct but differ significantly in scope, robustness, and enterprise readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both scripts address Oracle to Snowflake migration with stored procedure execution, data export, and validation. Simple_Migration_Script focuses on basic migration workflow while Comprehensive_Migration_Script provides extensive validation, comparison logic, and reporting capabilities. Core intent is aligned but Comprehensive_Migration_Script extends far beyond basic migration to include comprehensive data validation and enterprise features."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,N/A,"Simple_Migration_Script follows linear procedural approach with basic function organization (lines 1-150). Comprehensive_Migration_Script uses modular architecture with clear sections: Configuration (lines 1-50), Utilities (51-80), Connection Components (81-120), Oracle Execution (121-140), Data Export (141-180), Azure Transfer (181-220), External Tables (221-280), Comparison Logic (281-350), Reporting (351-400), Main Execution (401-500). Both follow similar high-level workflow but structural organization differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Simple_Migration_Script,95,45,"Valid Python syntax throughout. Minor issue: os.system() call on line 45 lacks proper error handling and could fail silently. All imports are standard and properly used. Variable references are consistent. Function definitions are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Migration_Script,98,N/A,"Excellent Python syntax and structure. Comprehensive error handling throughout. All imports properly used. Minor consideration: some functions could benefit from additional type hints, but code is production-ready with robust exception handling and logging."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both scripts demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with Comprehensive_Migration_Script showing superior error handling and code organization."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Simple_Migration_Script,N/A,45,"Enhance error handling for os.system() call on line 45. Consider adding more comprehensive logging and validation. Add data comparison features for migration verification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Migration_Script,N/A,N/A,"Excellent enterprise-ready solution. Consider adding type hints for better code documentation. Script demonstrates best practices for production migration scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"For production use, Comprehensive_Migration_Script is recommended due to superior error handling, validation capabilities, and enterprise features. Simple_Migration_Script suitable for basic migration scenarios but requires enhancement for production use."
