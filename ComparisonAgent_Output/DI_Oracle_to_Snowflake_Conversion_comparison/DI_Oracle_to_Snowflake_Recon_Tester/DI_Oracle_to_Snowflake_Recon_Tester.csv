Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide Python scripts for Oracle to Snowflake migration via Azure ADLS. Agent_2 offers significantly more comprehensive functionality with extensive error handling, validation, and reporting capabilities compared to Agent_1's simpler approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both scripts address the same core migration task with similar high-level objectives. Agent_1 provides basic migration functionality while Agent_2 extends this with comprehensive validation, reporting, and error handling. The core semantic intent is aligned but Agent_2 provides much broader scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"","Both follow similar high-level flow: connect → execute procedure → export → transfer → create external tables → validate. However, Agent_1 uses simple linear execution (lines 1-120) while Agent_2 employs modular design with distinct sections (lines 1-25 config, 27-50 utilities, 52-400+ implementation functions)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,75,"Line 89, Line 102","Agent_1 has syntax issues: Line 89 uses os.system() for Azure CLI without proper error handling or validation. Line 102 has incomplete external table creation syntax missing proper Azure integration parameters."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"","Agent_2 demonstrates robust implementation with proper exception handling, comprehensive logging, and complete function implementations. Minor deduction for complexity that could impact maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,"","Average of individual correctness scores: (75 + 95) / 2 = 85"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Line 89, Line 102","Improve error handling in Azure transfer function (line 89) and complete external table creation syntax (line 102). Add comprehensive logging and validation mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"","Consider simplifying some complex functions for better maintainability. The comprehensive approach is excellent but could benefit from modularization into separate files for very large deployments."
