Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Comprehensive comparison of two Oracle to Snowflake migration scripts. Ascendion_AVA+_Basic provides essential migration functionality with basic validation, while Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive delivers enterprise-grade solution with extensive error handling, detailed reporting, and advanced features. Both scripts share the same core objective but differ significantly in implementation depth and robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Both scripts address Oracle to Snowflake migration with data validation. Core functionality alignment includes: database connections, stored procedure execution, data export, Azure ADLS transfer, external table creation, and data comparison. Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive extends with comprehensive reporting (lines 320-350), advanced error handling (integrated throughout), and enterprise features like batch processing and integrity checks (lines 180-200). Semantic divergence occurs in implementation depth and feature completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Ascendion_AVA+_Basic follows linear procedural structure with simple function definitions (lines 15-120). Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive uses modular architecture with clear sectioning: Configuration (lines 20-45), Utilities (lines 50-70), Connection Components (lines 75-110), Oracle Execution (lines 115-130), Data Export (lines 135-170), Azure Transfer (lines 175-200), External Tables (lines 205-240), Comparison Logic (lines 245-290), Reporting (lines 295-350), Main Execution (lines 355-400). Structural approach differs significantly in organization and scalability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Basic,72,"Lines 70, 85, 95, 105","Syntax issues: Line 70 uses os.system() for Azure CLI without proper error handling or validation. Line 85 has potential SQL injection vulnerability in dynamic query construction. Line 95 missing proper cursor management in some functions. Line 105 pandas.DataFrame.equals() may fail with different column orders or data types. Missing import statements validation and exception handling in several functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive,85,"Lines 25, 180, 220","Minor syntax issues: Line 25 has potential undefined variable reference in error scenarios. Line 180 BlobServiceClient usage assumes proper Azure SDK setup. Line 220 SQL generation functions lack input sanitization. Overall strong syntax with comprehensive error handling, proper imports, and robust exception management throughout. Well-structured with consistent coding patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,79,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (72 + 85) / 2 = 78.5, rounded to 79. Both scripts have syntax validity with Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive showing superior error handling and code organization."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Basic,,"Lines 70, 85, 95","1. Replace os.system() calls with proper Azure SDK integration for secure file transfers. 2. Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. 3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout all functions. 4. Enhance data comparison logic to handle column order and data type differences. 5. Add input validation and sanitization for all external inputs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive,,"Lines 25, 180, 220","1. Add input sanitization to SQL generation functions to prevent injection attacks. 2. Implement retry mechanisms for Azure operations to handle transient failures. 3. Add configuration validation at startup to ensure all required environment variables are set. 4. Consider adding progress indicators for long-running operations. 5. Implement data sampling for very large table comparisons to improve performance."
