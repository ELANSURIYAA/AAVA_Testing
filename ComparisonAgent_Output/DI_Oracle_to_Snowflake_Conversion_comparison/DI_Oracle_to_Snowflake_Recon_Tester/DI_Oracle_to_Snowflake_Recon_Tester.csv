Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two Oracle to Snowflake migration Python scripts. Ascendion_AVA+_Basic provides fundamental migration functionality with basic error handling. Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive delivers enterprise-grade solution with extensive validation, logging, and robust error handling. Both scripts achieve the core migration objective but differ significantly in implementation depth and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Both scripts address identical core objective: Oracle to Snowflake migration via stored procedure execution, data export, ADLS transfer, and validation. Key semantic alignment: database connections (lines 18-35 vs 95-120), procedure execution (lines 37-45 vs 122-135), data export (lines 47-60 vs 137-170), ADLS transfer (lines 62-70 vs 172-190), external table creation (lines 72-85 vs 192-220), and data comparison (lines 87-110 vs 222-280). Semantic divergence: Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive adds comprehensive schema mapping, batch processing, integrity validation, and detailed reporting capabilities not present in basic version."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-400","Both follow similar high-level flow: imports, configuration, connection functions, execution functions, main orchestration. Structural alignment: modular function design, environment variable usage, try-catch error handling. Key differences: Ascendion_AVA+_Basic uses simple linear structure (150 lines) while Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive employs enterprise architecture with 12 distinct sections (400 lines), utility functions (lines 50-70), comprehensive schema definitions (lines 220-240), and advanced comparison logic (lines 280-320). Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive adds configuration section, utility functions, and detailed reporting components absent in basic version."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Basic,88,"Lines 62-70, 72-85","Syntax valid with minor issues: Line 67 uses os.system() for Azure CLI without proper error capture. Line 78 external table SQL syntax correct but lacks error handling for malformed queries. Line 95 pandas.equals() comparison may fail with different column orders or data types. Missing import validation for all required modules."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive,95,"Lines 170-190, 280-320","Highly robust syntax with comprehensive error handling. Minor areas for improvement: Line 185 blob upload integrity check could handle edge cases better. Line 295 DataFrame comparison logic assumes consistent column ordering. Line 350 temporary directory cleanup not explicitly handled in error scenarios. Overall excellent syntax quality with proper imports, exception handling, and type hints."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,"N/A","Average correctness score: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92. Both scripts demonstrate solid Python syntax with Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive showing superior error handling and robustness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Basic,N/A,"Lines 62-70, 95-110","Enhance error handling for Azure CLI operations (line 67). Implement proper data type handling in comparison logic (line 95). Add comprehensive logging throughout all functions. Include input validation for all parameters. Add retry mechanisms for network operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Comprehensive,N/A,"Lines 185, 295, 350","Add explicit temporary directory cleanup in finally blocks (line 350). Enhance DataFrame comparison to handle column order variations (line 295). Implement more granular blob upload integrity checks (line 185). Consider adding progress indicators for long-running operations. Add configuration validation at startup."
