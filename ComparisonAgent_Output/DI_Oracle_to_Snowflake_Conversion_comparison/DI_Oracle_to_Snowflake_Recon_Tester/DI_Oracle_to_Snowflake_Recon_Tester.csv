Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two Python scripts for Oracle to Snowflake migration with validation capabilities. AscendionAVA_Basic provides core migration functionality with basic error handling and data comparison. AscendionAVA_Comprehensive offers enterprise-grade implementation with comprehensive logging, Azure ADLS integration, detailed reporting, and robust error handling. Both scripts achieve the same fundamental goal but differ significantly in implementation depth and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Basic) vs Lines 1-400 (Comprehensive)","Both scripts address Oracle to Snowflake migration with stored procedure execution, data export, transfer to cloud storage, external table creation, and validation. Core semantic intent is identical - migrate and validate data between Oracle and Snowflake. AscendionAVA_Comprehensive extends the basic concept with additional enterprise features like detailed comparison reporting, Azure Blob integration, and comprehensive logging. The fundamental migration workflow semantics are preserved but enhanced."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 20-45 (Basic) vs Lines 50-120 (Comprehensive)","Both follow similar high-level structure: connection setup, procedure execution, data export, transfer, external table creation, and validation. AscendionAVA_Basic uses simple function-based approach with basic error handling. AscendionAVA_Comprehensive employs more sophisticated modular architecture with dedicated sections for configuration, utilities, connection management, and reporting. Control flow is similar but AscendionAVA_Comprehensive has better separation of concerns and more robust error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AscendionAVA_Basic,88,"Lines 75-80, 95-100","Valid Python syntax with proper import statements and function definitions. Minor issues: Line 75 uses os.system() for Azure CLI which lacks error handling and is not cross-platform safe. Line 95 uses basic string formatting in SQL which could be vulnerable to injection. Exception handling is present but basic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AscendionAVA_Comprehensive,95,"Lines 150-160, 280-290","Excellent Python syntax with comprehensive imports and proper type hints. Strong error handling throughout with try-catch blocks and logging. Uses parameterized queries and proper Azure SDK integration. Minor improvement area: Line 280 could benefit from connection pooling for better performance. Overall very robust implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual scores: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92. Both scripts are syntactically correct with AscendionAVA_Comprehensive showing superior error handling and security practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AscendionAVA_Basic,,"Replace os.system() calls with proper Azure SDK integration for better error handling and cross-platform compatibility. Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Add comprehensive logging and progress reporting for production use. Consider adding data validation checkpoints and rollback mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AscendionAVA_Comprehensive,,"Excellent enterprise-ready implementation. Consider adding connection pooling for better performance with large datasets. Implement parallel processing for multiple table migrations. Add configuration validation at startup. Consider adding retry mechanisms for transient failures in cloud operations."
