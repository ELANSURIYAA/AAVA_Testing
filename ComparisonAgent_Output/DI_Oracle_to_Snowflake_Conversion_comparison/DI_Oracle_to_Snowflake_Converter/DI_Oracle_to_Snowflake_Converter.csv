Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-65,"Both outputs implement Snowflake stored procedures for loading agent data from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D with audit logging. Agent 1 uses SQL language with native Snowflake syntax, while Agent 2 uses JavaScript with embedded SQL. Both achieve the same functional outcome through different technical approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both procedures accomplish identical business logic: upsert agent data using MERGE statement, capture timestamps, log success/failure to AUDIT_LOG, and handle exceptions. Minor differences in return messages and timestamp handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both follow similar high-level flow: variable initialization, MERGE operation, audit logging, exception handling. However, Agent 1 uses SQL procedural blocks while Agent 2 uses JavaScript try-catch structure. Different variable declaration and SQL execution patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,98,"Lines 35,47","Syntactically correct SQL procedure. Minor issue: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP used without parentheses in lines 35,47 which is valid but inconsistent with Snowflake best practices that prefer CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,,"Syntactically correct JavaScript procedure. Proper use of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() with parentheses, correct JavaScript syntax, proper parameter binding in SQL statements, and appropriate exception handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both procedures are syntactically sound with only minor style considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 35,47","Consider using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() with parentheses for consistency with Snowflake best practices. The current syntax is valid but the function call syntax is preferred."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,,"Excellent implementation following Snowflake JavaScript best practices. Consider adding more detailed error context in exception messages for enhanced debugging capabilities."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both implementations are production-ready. Agent 1 offers better performance for simple operations, while Agent 2 provides more flexibility for complex logic. Choose based on team expertise and maintenance requirements."
