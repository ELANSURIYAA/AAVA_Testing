Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Matillion ETL job 'FileToSnowflakeMappingJob'. They cover identical functional content including job purpose, data sources, transformation steps, and configuration parameters. The main differences lie in structural organization and presentation format, with Agent_2 demonstrating superior documentation structure and readability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150 (Agent_1), Lines 1-200 (Agent_2)","Both documents address the identical ETL job with same purpose, data sources (/path/to/source_file.csv to Snowflake target_table), transformation logic (filter status='active', rename old_column_name to new_column_name), and configuration parameters. Minor semantic differences in description phrasing but core meaning is preserved across all sections."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 5-15 (Agent_1), Lines 8-25 (Agent_2)","Both follow similar documentation structure with table of contents, introduction, job documentation, and appendices. Agent_2 demonstrates better hierarchical organization with cleaner numbering (3.1, 4.1 vs 1.1, 2.1) and improved section flow. Agent_1 uses markdown formatting while Agent_2 uses plain text with better indentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 20, 45, 80","Well-formed documentation structure with proper markdown syntax. Minor issues: inconsistent formatting in some sections and placeholder text '[Your Name]' and '[Insert Date]' not filled. All technical content is accurate and complete."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 15, 35, 60","Excellent documentation structure with consistent formatting and complete information. All sections are properly filled with actual content. Clean hierarchical numbering and professional presentation. No syntax or formatting issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with Agent_2 showing slightly superior completeness and formatting consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Replace placeholder text with actual values, improve formatting consistency, and consider adopting the cleaner hierarchical structure demonstrated in Agent_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain current high-quality documentation standards. Consider adding more detailed error handling examples and performance metrics to further enhance completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully document the ETL job comprehensively. Agent_2 provides a slightly better template for future documentation projects due to superior organization and completeness."
