Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output produce comprehensive Matillion ETL documentation for the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob with nearly identical semantic content and purpose. The documentation covers the same ETL process: extracting data from CSV files, applying transformations (filtering by status='active' and column renaming), and loading to Snowflake. Key differences lie in formatting approach and section numbering, but the core technical content, data flow, and operational details remain consistent across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs document identical ETL processes with same job name (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob), same transformations (filter status='active', rename old_column_name to new_column_name), same data sources (CSV at /path/to/source_file.csv), and same target (Snowflake target_table). Technical specifications, variables, and operational details are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in phrasing do not affect core meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs follow similar documentation structure with title page, table of contents, introduction, project structure, and detailed sections. Agent_1_Output uses markdown formatting with # headers while Agent_2_Output uses numbered sections. Section numbering differs (Agent_1_Output starts at 1.1, Agent_2_Output at 3.1). Overall logical flow and section organization are highly similar despite formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,"Lines 1-200","Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and valid structure. All sections are properly formatted and cross-references are accurate. Minor formatting inconsistency in one table structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,99,"Lines 1-200","Documentation is syntactically correct with consistent numbered section format, proper internal structure, and accurate references throughout. All technical details are properly formatted and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average correctness score across both outputs. Both demonstrate high syntactic accuracy and internal consistency with only minor formatting variations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Consider standardizing markdown formatting consistency, particularly in table structures. Ensure all section references use consistent numbering scheme."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Maintain current high level of internal consistency and formatting standards. Consider adding markdown formatting for better readability if target platform supports it."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent technical accuracy and comprehensive coverage. Consider establishing a standardized documentation template to ensure consistent formatting across different documentation efforts while maintaining the high quality of technical content present in both outputs."
