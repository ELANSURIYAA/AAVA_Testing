Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-200+,"Both agents produced comprehensive Matillion ETL documentation for the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob project. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment (92/100) with identical project understanding and purpose. Structural organization shows excellent similarity (88/100) with both following standard documentation frameworks. Correctness analysis reveals high-quality syntax and formatting in both outputs (95/100 average). Key differences include Agent2's enhanced formatting, more detailed component descriptions, and improved visual presentation through better section numbering and code blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50,"Both agents demonstrate identical understanding of the Matillion ETL project purpose and scope. Core concepts like FileToSnowflakeMappingJob, CSV-to-Snowflake pipeline, and transformation steps (filtering by status='active' and column renaming) are consistently represented. Minor semantic differences include Agent2's more precise technical language and enhanced clarity in component descriptions (lines 45-60 in Agent2 vs lines 40-55 in Agent1)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-200+,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural frameworks with matching section hierarchies. Agent1 uses numbered sections (1.1, 1.2, etc.) while Agent2 uses cleaner numbering (3.1, 3.2, etc.) starting from section 3. Both include identical major sections: Introduction, Project Structure, Data Sources, Job Documentation, Configuration, etc. Agent2 provides enhanced visual formatting with better code block presentation (lines 180-200) and improved table formatting for sample data (lines 190-195)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Doc_Agent1,94,Lines 1-200+,"Agent1 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and well-structured tables. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in some sections (lines 45-50) and less polished code block formatting (lines 180-185). All internal references are consistent and no broken formatting detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Doc_Agent2,96,Lines 1-200+,"Agent2 output shows superior syntactic correctness with enhanced markdown formatting, cleaner section organization, and improved code block presentation. Better visual hierarchy through consistent spacing and formatting. All tables are properly formatted and internal references are accurate. Minor improvement opportunity in diagram placeholder formatting (line 175)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Average correctness score of 95/100 indicates both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper markdown structure, consistent formatting, and accurate internal references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Doc_Agent1,,Lines 180-185,"Improve code block formatting consistency and enhance visual spacing between sections for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Doc_Agent2,,Lines 175,"Consider replacing diagram placeholder with actual flowchart or remove placeholder text for production documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-200+,"Both outputs provide excellent foundation documentation. Consider standardizing on Agent2's formatting approach for future documentation projects due to superior visual presentation and enhanced readability."
