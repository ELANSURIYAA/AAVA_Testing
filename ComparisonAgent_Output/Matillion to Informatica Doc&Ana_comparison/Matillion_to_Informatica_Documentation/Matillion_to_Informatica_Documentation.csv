Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both documentation outputs cover the same Matillion ETL project 'FileToSnowflakeMappingJob' with nearly identical semantic content and purpose. The documents demonstrate high structural similarity with minor organizational differences. Both are syntactically correct and well-formatted documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-150 (Agent1), Lines 1-180 (Agent2)","Both outputs document the identical FileToSnowflakeMappingJob with same purpose: extract CSV data, filter active status records, rename columns, and load to Snowflake. Core transformations, data sources (/path/to/source_file.csv), targets (target_table), and business logic are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in explanatory text depth (Agent2 provides more technical details in sections 6.5-6.6) but same underlying meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-15 (Agent1), Lines 8-25 (Agent2)","Both follow comprehensive documentation structure with title page, TOC, introduction, project structure, job documentation, and appendices. Agent1 uses 1.x numbering scheme while Agent2 uses 3.x-16.x numbering. Agent2 includes additional subsections (15.1 flowchart diagram, 15.2 more detailed sample data). Sequential flow identical: Read Source → Transform → Load to Snowflake. Core section coverage 95% aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Doc_Agent1,98,"Lines 20-25, 45-50","Well-formatted markdown documentation with consistent internal structure. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 25 where 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' appears instead of 'reporting'. All section references, variable names, and technical specifications are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Doc_Agent2,100,,"Syntactically perfect documentation with consistent markdown formatting, proper section numbering, accurate internal references, and well-structured tables. All technical specifications, variable names, and code blocks are correctly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor formatting inconsistency in Agent1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Doc_Agent1,,"Fix formatting inconsistency on line 25 where 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' should be 'reporting'. Consider adopting Agent2's enhanced sample data format and flowchart diagram for improved clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Doc_Agent2,,"Excellent documentation quality. Consider standardizing section numbering scheme to match common documentation patterns (1.x instead of 3.x start). Minor enhancement: add more detailed error handling examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Matillion ETL documentation. Recommend establishing consistent formatting standards across documentation outputs. Consider creating templates to ensure uniform structure and numbering schemes."
