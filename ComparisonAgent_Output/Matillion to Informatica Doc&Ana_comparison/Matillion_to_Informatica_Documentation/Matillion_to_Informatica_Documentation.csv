Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs document the same FileToSnowflakeMappingJob ETL process with identical semantic content. Original_Documentation provides comprehensive coverage while Structured_Documentation offers better organization and formatting. Key similarities include: same job purpose (CSV to Snowflake ETL), identical transformation steps (filter active status, rename columns), same configuration variables, and equivalent technical specifications. Minor structural differences exist in section numbering and formatting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs address identical ETL requirements with same job purpose, data sources, transformations, and target specifications. Core semantic elements match: FileToSnowflakeMappingJob name, CSV source file processing, status filtering for 'active' records, column renaming from 'old_column_name' to 'new_column_name', Snowflake bulk loading, and same configuration variables. Minor semantic differences in explanatory text and section emphasis reduce score from perfect match."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-150,"Both follow similar documentation structure with table of contents, introduction, job documentation, configuration sections, and appendices. Structured_Documentation uses numbered sections (3.1, 4.1, etc.) while Original_Documentation uses basic numbering (1.1, 2.1, etc.). Both include same major sections: Introduction, Project Structure, Data Sources/Targets, Job Documentation, Configuration, Performance, Limitations. Structural flow and logical organization are nearly identical with formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Original_Documentation,98,Lines 1-75,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and valid table structures. Minor formatting inconsistency in sample data table alignment (line 140-145) and one missing image placeholder reference (line 135) prevent perfect score."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Structured_Documentation,99,Lines 76-150,"Documentation demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with clean numbered section structure, proper formatting, consistent table layouts, and well-formed sample data examples. Minor issue with ASCII diagram formatting in appendix section (line 145) slightly reduces score."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,Lines 1-150,"Average correctness score of 98.5 rounded to 99. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper documentation structure, valid formatting, and consistent internal references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Original_Documentation,N/A,Lines 1-75,"Improve table formatting consistency in sample data sections and ensure all image placeholders have valid references or descriptions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Structured_Documentation,N/A,Lines 76-150,"Enhance ASCII diagram formatting in appendix section for better readability and consider adding more detailed error handling documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide solid documentation foundation. Consider standardizing on numbered section format from Structured_Documentation for consistency. Add more detailed error scenarios, data validation steps, and operational runbook sections for production readiness."
