Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both agents produced comprehensive Matillion ETL documentation for the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob with high semantic alignment (95/100) and strong structural similarity (88/100). Agent 1 provides a more traditional documentation format while Agent 2 offers enhanced organization and technical detail. Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with minor formatting variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-150,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting a Matillion ETL job that extracts CSV data, transforms it (filtering and column renaming), and loads to Snowflake. Key semantic alignments include: job purpose (lines 25-27 vs 45-47), transformation steps (lines 65-67 vs 85-87), data sources and targets (lines 35-40 vs 55-65), and configuration parameters (lines 95-100 vs 115-125). Minor semantic differences in emphasis on technical details and operational considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-150,"Strong structural alignment with both following standard technical documentation patterns. Shared sections include: Introduction, Project Structure, Data Sources/Targets, Job Documentation, Configuration, Performance Optimization, and Setup Instructions. Agent 1 uses a more linear 14-section approach (lines 5-20) while Agent 2 employs a 16-section hierarchical structure (lines 10-30). Key structural difference: Agent 2 includes enhanced appendices with sample data tables and flow diagrams (lines 140-150)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,1-150,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid table structures. Minor issues: incomplete image reference placeholder (line 130) and generic placeholder text for author/date fields (lines 2-3). All internal references are consistent and section hierarchy is properly maintained."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,99,1-150,"Near-perfect syntactic correctness with enhanced formatting consistency. Proper markdown tables, code blocks, and hierarchical numbering throughout. All placeholders are appropriately formatted and internal references are complete. Minor formatting variation in version history table structure (line 145) but remains syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' high syntactic quality with Agent 2 showing slightly superior formatting consistency and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,65-67,"Consider enhancing transformation documentation with more technical detail similar to Agent 2's approach. Add structured sample data examples and improve placeholder completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,85-87,"Maintain current level of technical detail and formatting consistency. Consider adding more operational context similar to Agent 1's performance considerations section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs represent high-quality documentation suitable for production use. Consider combining Agent 1's operational focus with Agent 2's enhanced technical structure for optimal documentation."
