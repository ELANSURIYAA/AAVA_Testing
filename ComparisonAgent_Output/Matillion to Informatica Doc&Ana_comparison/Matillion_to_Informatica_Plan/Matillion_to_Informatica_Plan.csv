Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs address Matillion to Informatica ETL job conversion cost estimation and effort analysis. Agent1_Output provides higher data volume estimates (3.3TB vs 100-200GB) and significantly higher manual effort estimates (25 hours vs 5 hours). Agent2_Output includes more detailed justification and structured presentation with summary tables. Both outputs cover the same core requirements: runtime costs, manual effort estimation, and API costs, but with different assumptions and methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All Lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Matillion to Informatica conversion. However, they differ significantly in assumptions: Agent1_Output assumes 3.3TB data processing requiring 25 hours of manual work, while Agent2_Output assumes 100-200GB data requiring only 5 hours. Both cover runtime costs, manual effort, and API costs but with different calculation methodologies and underlying assumptions about job complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with three main sections: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, and API Cost Calculation. Agent1_Output uses numbered sections (1,2,3) with bullet-point breakdowns. Agent2_Output uses similar sectioning but includes additional summary table and more detailed subsection organization. Both maintain logical flow from cost estimation through effort analysis to final API cost reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Output,95,Lines 1-25,"Agent1_Output demonstrates strong internal consistency with clear mathematical relationships between data volume (3.3TB), runtime (3.3 hours), and cost ranges ($0.495-$2.475). All effort breakdowns sum correctly to 25 hours total. Syntax is clean with proper formatting and no broken references. Minor deduction for less detailed justification of assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Output,98,Lines 1-45,"Agent2_Output shows excellent internal consistency with detailed calculations (4 DBUs × 1 hour × $0.75 = $3.00), proper mathematical relationships, and comprehensive justification. Summary table accurately reflects all estimates. All references are consistent, formatting is clean, and no syntax errors detected. Strong documentation of assumptions and methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All Lines,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper syntax, consistent internal references, and valid mathematical calculations. Agent2_Output slightly edges ahead with more comprehensive documentation and clearer calculation transparency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Output,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Strengthen justification for high data volume assumptions (3.3TB) and provide more detailed calculation transparency. Consider adding summary table for better readability and include more granular breakdown of cost drivers."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Output,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider addressing potential scalability scenarios beyond 200GB and provide alternative estimates for different data volume ranges to increase applicability across various use cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs would benefit from alignment on data volume assumptions and standardized calculation methodologies. Consider creating a unified framework that addresses multiple scenarios (small, medium, large data volumes) to provide more comprehensive guidance for different implementation contexts."
