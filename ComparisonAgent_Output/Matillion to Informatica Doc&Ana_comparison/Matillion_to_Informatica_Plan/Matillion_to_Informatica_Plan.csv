Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Matillion to Informatica ETL job conversion. Agent_1 estimates $2.475 maximum runtime cost with 25 total hours of effort, while Agent_2 estimates $3.00 runtime cost with 5 total hours of effort. Key differences include data volume assumptions (3.3TB vs 100-200GB), effort estimation methodology, and level of detail in breakdown analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of cost estimation and effort analysis for ETL conversion. However, Agent_1 assumes 3.3TB data volume while Agent_2 assumes 100-200GB, leading to different cost calculations. Both identify similar cost drivers (data volume, processing efficiency, DBU pricing) but with different emphasis and detail levels."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar three-section structure: 1) Cost Estimation, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort, 3) API Cost Calculation. Agent_1 uses numbered sections with detailed sub-bullets, while Agent_2 uses headers with bullet points and includes a summary table. Both maintain logical flow from cost analysis to effort estimation to final API cost."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-25,"Agent_1 output is syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting, proper numerical calculations, and coherent structure. Minor issue: some formatting inconsistencies in bullet point indentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 26-50,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and table structure. Contains one formatting inconsistency in the summary table alignment and minor redundancy in cost driver explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent numerical presentations, and logical structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies in both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Standardize data volume assumptions and provide range-based estimates. Improve formatting consistency in bullet point structure. Consider adding summary table for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 26-50,"Align data volume assumptions with industry standards. Fix table formatting inconsistencies. Reduce redundancy in cost driver explanations while maintaining comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents should establish consistent data volume baselines for accurate cost comparisons. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_1's detailed breakdown with Agent_2's summary table format. Standardize effort estimation methodologies for better alignment."
