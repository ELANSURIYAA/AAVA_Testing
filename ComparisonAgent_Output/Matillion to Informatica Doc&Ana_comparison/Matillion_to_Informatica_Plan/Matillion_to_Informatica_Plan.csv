Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs address Matillion to Informatica migration cost estimation but with significantly different assumptions and conclusions. Agent_1 estimates 3.3TB data volume with 25 hours total effort and $0.495-$2.475 runtime cost, while Agent_2 estimates 100-200GB data volume with 5 hours total effort and $3.00 runtime cost. The outputs show semantic alignment in purpose but structural and assumption differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Informatica runtime costs and manual effort for Matillion migration. However, they differ significantly in data volume assumptions (3.3TB vs 100-200GB) and effort estimates (25 hours vs 5 hours). The semantic intent is aligned but with different interpretations of job complexity and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,1-50,"Both outputs follow similar structural organization with three main sections: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, and API Cost Calculation. Agent_1 uses numbered sections with detailed breakdowns, while Agent_2 uses headers with bullet points and includes a summary table. The logical flow is consistent despite formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-25,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent numbering, and well-structured content. Minor issue: DBU pricing range explanation could be clearer in lines 8-10."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,90,26-50,"Agent_2 output is mostly syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and table structure. Issues include inconsistent bullet point formatting in lines 35-40 and missing closing asterisk in line 48 for the API cost section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs are well-formed with minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,1-25,"Clarify data volume assumptions and provide rationale for 3.3TB estimate. Break down the 25-hour effort estimate with more granular task definitions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,26-50,"Fix formatting inconsistencies in bullet points and markdown structure. Consider providing range estimates rather than single point estimates for better risk assessment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-50,"Standardize data volume assumptions and effort estimation methodologies. Both agents should align on job complexity assessment criteria and provide confidence intervals for estimates."
