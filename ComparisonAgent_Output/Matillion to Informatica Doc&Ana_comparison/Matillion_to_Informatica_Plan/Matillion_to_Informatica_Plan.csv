Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Two cost estimation reports for Matillion to Informatica conversion with significant differences in scope and estimates. Agent1 estimates 3.3TB data volume with 25 hours total effort and $2.475 cost, while Agent2 estimates 100-200GB data volume with 5 hours total effort and $3.00 runtime cost. Both follow similar structural approaches but differ substantially in assumptions and calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All Lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Matillion to Informatica conversion. They cover identical categories: runtime costs, manual effort estimation, and API costs. However, they make different assumptions about data volume (3.3TB vs 100-200GB) and complexity, leading to different conclusions. The semantic intent is aligned but execution differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Cost Estimation with runtime breakdown, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort with manual fixes and validation, 3) API Cost Calculation. Agent2 includes an additional summary table and more detailed justification sections, but the core flow and decomposition are very similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,Lines 1-25,"Well-structured report with consistent internal references. Minor formatting inconsistency in the nested bullet structure but all calculations and references are coherent. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,Lines 1-60,"Excellent structure with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structure, and clear section organization. All calculations are properly presented and internally consistent. Very minor formatting variations in bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All Lines,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal structure, and valid presentation formats. Average of individual scores: (95+98)/2 = 96.5, rounded to 97."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Consider providing more detailed breakdown of assumptions and including summary tables for better readability. Add justification sections to explain the basis for estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,Lines 1-60,"Excellent structure and presentation. Consider aligning data volume assumptions with Agent1 for consistency if both are addressing the same conversion scenario."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents should clarify the scope and data volume assumptions upfront. Consider standardizing the estimation methodology and providing confidence intervals for cost estimates. Agent2's summary table format should be adopted by Agent1 for better presentation."
