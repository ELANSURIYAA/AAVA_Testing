Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob Matillion ETL pipeline. Agent 1 presents a markdown-formatted report with clear section headers, while Agent 2 uses numbered sections with more detailed component specifications and timestamps. Both cover identical analytical dimensions: job overview, performance, data flow, transformations, scheduling, security, and optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs demonstrate nearly identical semantic intent and analytical depth. They address the same ETL job with consistent understanding of its purpose, components, and functionality. Agent 2 provides slightly more technical detail (timestamps, specific variable names, error handling configurations) while Agent 1 focuses more on high-level analysis. The core meaning and conclusions are highly aligned with only minor differences in emphasis and granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with the same major analytical sections. Agent 1 uses markdown headers (# Executive Summary, # Job Overview, etc.) while Agent 2 uses numbered sections (1. Executive Summary, 2. Job Overview, etc.). The logical flow and section progression are virtually identical, with both following the same analytical framework from overview through recommendations. Minor structural differences include Agent 2's additional numbered subsections and more detailed component breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,98,"Lines 1-50","Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent header hierarchy, and well-formed bullet points. All internal references are consistent and no broken formatting detected. Minor deduction for one inconsistent spacing pattern in the transformation steps section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,96,"Lines 1-60","Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with proper numbered section formatting and consistent structure. All technical details and variable names are properly formatted. Minor deductions for inconsistent bullet point formatting in the components section (lines 12-15) and one missing period in the conclusion section (line 58)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal structure, and no major syntax errors. Average score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies in both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Agent 1 provides a well-structured analysis with clear markdown formatting that enhances readability. The report effectively covers all required analytical dimensions with appropriate depth. Recommendation: Consider adding more specific technical details about job components and variables to match the comprehensiveness of Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Agent 2 delivers comprehensive technical analysis with excellent detail on job components, variables, and configurations. The numbered section structure provides clear organization. Recommendation: Improve consistency in bullet point formatting and ensure all sentences are properly punctuated to achieve perfect syntactic correctness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully fulfill the analytical requirements with high semantic and structural alignment. For future iterations, consider standardizing formatting approaches and ensuring consistent technical detail levels across both analytical frameworks. Both reports provide valuable insights for ETL job optimization and would serve well as comprehensive analysis documents."
