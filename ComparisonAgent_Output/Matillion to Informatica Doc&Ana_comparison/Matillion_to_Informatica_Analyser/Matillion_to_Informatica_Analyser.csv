Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-5 (Agent 1) vs Lines 1-3 (Agent 2),"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis reports of the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob Matillion ETL pipeline. Agent 1 uses markdown formatting with clear section headers, while Agent 2 uses numbered sections with more detailed technical specifications. Both cover identical core topics: job overview, performance, data flow, transformations, scheduling, security, and recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All sections,"Both outputs address the same ETL job analysis with nearly identical intent and meaning. Key differences: Agent 1 uses more concise descriptions while Agent 2 provides more technical detail (timestamps, specific component names, variable definitions). Both identify the same transformation logic (filtering by status='active', column renaming), same data flow (CSV to Snowflake), and similar optimization recommendations. Minor semantic differences in emphasis on technical specifications vs. business overview."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Section organization,"Both outputs follow similar logical structure with 7-8 main sections covering identical topics in similar order. Agent 1 uses markdown headers (# ##) while Agent 2 uses numbered sections (1. 2. 3.). Both include: Executive Summary, Job Overview, Performance Analysis, Data Flow Analysis, Transformation Logic, Scheduling, Security Assessment, and Recommendations. Agent 2 includes additional subsections and more granular breakdowns within each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Lines 15-20 job details,"Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown structure, consistent formatting, and no broken references. Minor issue: Generic placeholder paths ('/path/to/source_file.csv') without specific technical details that could be more precise."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,Lines 8-12 job metadata,"Agent 2 output is highly syntactically correct with proper numbered structure, consistent formatting, and comprehensive technical details. Includes specific timestamps, component names, and variable definitions. No syntax errors or broken references identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper structure and formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 85-95,"Agent 1 provides solid foundational recommendations but could benefit from more specific technical details and implementation guidance. Consider adding timestamps, component specifications, and more granular optimization strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 65-85,"Agent 2 demonstrates excellent technical depth and comprehensive coverage. The structured approach with numbered sections and detailed specifications provides superior clarity for technical implementation. Maintain this level of detail for production documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Overall comparison,"Both outputs serve their purpose well for ETL job analysis. For technical documentation, Agent 2's approach with detailed specifications and structured numbering is preferred. For executive summaries, Agent 1's concise markdown format may be more accessible. Consider combining Agent 1's readability with Agent 2's technical depth for optimal documentation."
