Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-4 vs 1-8,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the Matillion ETL job 'FileToSnowflakeMappingJob'. Agent 1 presents a concise executive summary focusing on job design and analysis coverage. Agent 2 provides more detailed context including job components and variables. Both identify the same core functionality: CSV file extraction, transformation, and Snowflake loading."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-100 vs 1-150,"Both outputs analyze identical ETL job with same core components and transformations. Agent 1 focuses on high-level analysis while Agent 2 provides more granular technical details including timestamps, variables, and specific configurations. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 emphasizes optimization opportunities while Agent 2 provides more operational context. Both reach similar conclusions about job effectiveness and improvement areas."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-100 vs 1-150,"Agent 1 uses markdown header structure (# ## ###) with clear section breaks and bullet points. Agent 2 uses numbered sections (1. 2. 3.) with sub-bullets and more detailed breakdowns. Both follow logical flow: Overview → Performance → Data Flow → Transformations → Scheduling → Security → Recommendations → Conclusion. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like timestamps, variables section, and more granular sub-sections. Different presentation styles but similar information architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 15-20,"Well-formed markdown with consistent header hierarchy and proper bullet point formatting. Minor issue: Line 15 shows 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' which appears to be a formatting artifact rather than intended content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-150,"Properly structured numbered sections with consistent formatting. All technical details, timestamps, and configurations are syntactically correct. No formatting errors or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minimal formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 80-95,"Consider adding more technical details like timestamps and variable definitions for better operational context. The formatting artifact 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' should be corrected. Maintain the clear markdown structure while incorporating more granular technical information."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 120-140,"Excellent technical depth and operational details. Consider adding more visual breaks or formatting to improve readability of dense sections. The numbered structure works well but could benefit from some markdown formatting for better visual hierarchy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide valuable analysis with complementary strengths. Agent_1 offers clear, concise presentation while Agent_2 provides comprehensive technical detail. Future iterations could combine Agent_1's readability with Agent_2's technical depth for optimal documentation."
