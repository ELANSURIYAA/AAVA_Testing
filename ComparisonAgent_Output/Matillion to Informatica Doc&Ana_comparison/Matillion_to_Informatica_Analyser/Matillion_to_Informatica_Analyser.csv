Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analyses of the FileToSnowflakeMappingJob ETL pipeline. Matillion_Analysis delivers a structured markdown report with clear section breaks, while Informatica_Analyser provides a numbered analytical framework with enhanced technical detail. Both achieve the same analytical objectives with high semantic alignment but different structural approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs analyze identical ETL job components with nearly identical conclusions. Core analysis covers same job overview (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob), performance characteristics (bulk loading, sequential execution), data flow (CSV to Snowflake), transformations (filtering status='active', column renaming), and optimization recommendations. Minor differences in emphasis: Matillion_Analysis focuses on general scalability, while Informatica_Analyser provides more specific technical metrics and timestamps."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 35-45","Both follow similar analytical progression: Executive Summary → Job Overview → Performance → Data Flow → Transformations → Security → Recommendations → Conclusion. Matillion_Analysis uses markdown headers with section breaks, while Informatica_Analyser uses numbered sections (1-9). Informatica_Analyser includes additional structured elements like explicit timestamps, component lists, and variable definitions that Matillion_Analysis presents more narratively."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Analysis,98,"Lines 5, 12, 28","Excellent markdown syntax with proper header hierarchy, consistent formatting, and valid internal structure. Minor issue: Line 28 contains 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting' which appears to be a formatting artifact that should be 'reporting'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Informatica_Analyser,100,,"Perfect documentation syntax with consistent numbered sections, proper bullet points, well-formatted technical specifications, and clean internal references throughout all 9 sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minimal formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Analysis,,"Enhance structural consistency by adopting numbered section format for better navigation. Fix formatting artifact on line 28. Consider adding technical specifications like timestamps and component lists for improved completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Informatica_Analyser,,"Excellent technical documentation. Consider adding visual section breaks or markdown formatting to improve readability. The numbered structure is comprehensive but could benefit from hierarchical subsections for complex topics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully analyze the ETL job with high accuracy and completeness. For future iterations: standardize structural approach, enhance cross-referencing between sections, and consider adding visual diagrams for data flow representation."
