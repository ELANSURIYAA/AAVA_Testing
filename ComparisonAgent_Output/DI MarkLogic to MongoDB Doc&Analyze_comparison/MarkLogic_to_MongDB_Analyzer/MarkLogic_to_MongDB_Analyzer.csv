Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analysis reports covering schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing strategies, query analysis, performance considerations, and recommendations. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in addressing migration requirements, with structural differences in organization and presentation. Both outputs are syntactically correct and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same migration analysis goal with similar core content covering schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing, queries, and recommendations. Agent 1 provides more structured XML-to-BSON examples while Agent 2 includes additional elements like API cost tracking and complete code reference. The semantic intent and technical approach are highly aligned despite presentation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-20 (headers), Lines 50-100 (main sections)","Both outputs follow similar numbered section structure (1. Schema Analysis, 2. Data Model Mapping, etc.) but differ in subsection organization. Agent 1 uses more granular subsections with clear hierarchies, while Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like API cost reporting and complete code appendix. The core flow and logical decomposition are similar but with notable organizational differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 15-25 (XML examples), Lines 80-90 (code blocks)","Agent 1 output is well-formatted with proper XML syntax, consistent markdown structure, and accurate technical content. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some code block indentation but overall high syntactic correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 10-15 (metadata), Lines 180-200 (code reference)","Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and valid code examples. Includes additional metadata elements like API cost. Some minor inconsistencies in section numbering format but overall strong syntactic correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid code examples, and consistent structure. Average score reflects minor formatting variations but strong overall quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Maintain the clear hierarchical structure and detailed XML-to-BSON mapping examples. Consider adding metadata tracking elements like API cost for operational visibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Preserve the comprehensive code reference appendix and API cost tracking. Consider improving section numbering consistency and subsection organization for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide valuable migration analysis. Consider combining Agent 1's structured approach with Agent 2's operational metadata tracking for optimal results. Standardize formatting conventions across both approaches."
