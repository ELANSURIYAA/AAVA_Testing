Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents produced comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analysis reports with similar overall structure and coverage. The reports address schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing strategies, query conversion, and recommendations. Key differences lie in presentation style, level of detail, and specific technical approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core migration challenge with similar understanding of MarkLogic XML documents, MongoDB BSON conversion, indexing strategies, and CRUD operations. Agent 1 provides more structured sections with clear XML/JSON examples, while Agent 2 includes the complete MarkLogic code reference. Both correctly identify namespace handling challenges and text indexing equivalents. Minor differences in emphasis on performance considerations and dependency analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both reports follow similar high-level structure with 7 main sections covering schema, data mapping, indexing, queries, performance, dependencies, and recommendations. Agent 1 uses more consistent markdown formatting with clear subsections and code blocks. Agent 2 has a flatter structure with some sections combined and includes the complete source code at the end. Flow and logical progression are similar but presentation differs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Minor syntax issues in XML namespace declarations and some MongoDB query examples could be more precise. Overall technically sound with correct XQuery to MongoDB mappings."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 80-90, 150-160","Some inconsistencies in code formatting and minor technical inaccuracies in MongoDB syntax examples. Complete MarkLogic code reference is accurate and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor syntax and formatting issues that don't affect overall correctness of the migration analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,,"Enhance MongoDB query examples with more precise syntax, add error handling patterns, and include performance benchmarking guidelines."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,,"Improve document structure consistency, add more detailed indexing strategies, and expand on MongoDB-specific optimization techniques."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both agents should include migration timeline estimates, data validation strategies, and rollback procedures. Consider adding sections on testing methodologies and production deployment considerations."
