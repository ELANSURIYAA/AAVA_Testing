Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analyses with similar scope and depth. Output 1 presents a structured report with clear sections covering schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing strategy, query analysis, performance considerations, dependency analysis, and recommendations. Output 2 follows a similar structure but includes more detailed subsections, specific code examples, and a complete MarkLogic code reference appendix. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the migration requirements and provide actionable insights."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 75-100, 150-200","Both outputs address the identical core objective of analyzing MarkLogic to MongoDB migration. They cover the same fundamental topics: schema analysis (collections, document structures, indexes), data model mapping (XML to BSON conversion), indexing strategies, query translations, and performance considerations. The semantic intent is highly aligned with both providing similar conclusions about feasibility, challenges, and recommendations. Minor differences exist in emphasis and specific implementation details, but the overall meaning and purpose are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-25, 50-75, 175-200","Both outputs follow a similar high-level structure with numbered sections covering the same migration aspects. Output 1 uses a more compact organization with 7 main sections, while Output 2 provides more detailed subsections and includes a complete code reference appendix (lines 175-200). Both use consistent formatting with headers, bullet points, and code blocks. The logical flow is similar but Output 2 provides more granular organization within sections. The structural approach to problem decomposition is largely aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,95,"Lines 25-30, 60-65","Output 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, valid XML and JSON code examples, and consistent internal structure. All code snippets are properly formatted and syntactically valid. Minor issues include some inconsistent spacing in code blocks (lines 25-30) and one instance of incomplete sentence structure (line 60-65). All references and examples are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,97,"Lines 180-200","Output 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid code examples, and comprehensive structure. All XML, JSON, and JavaScript code snippets are syntactically correct. The complete MarkLogic code reference (lines 180-200) is properly formatted and valid XQuery syntax. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in spacing but overall excellent technical accuracy and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid code examples, proper formatting, and consistent internal structure. Average score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies but overall excellent technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,"Lines 150-200","Consider adding more detailed subsection organization similar to Output 2 to improve readability and navigation. Include complete code reference appendix for better technical documentation. Enhance specific implementation examples for MongoDB aggregation pipelines."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,"Lines 1-25","Consider consolidating some subsections to improve overall flow and reduce fragmentation. The detailed structure is excellent but could benefit from better executive summary integration. Minor formatting consistency improvements in code block spacing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 100-150","Both outputs provide excellent migration analysis. Consider combining the compact organization of Output 1 with the detailed subsection structure of Output 2 for optimal documentation. Both would benefit from more specific performance benchmarking data and detailed error handling strategies for the migration process."
