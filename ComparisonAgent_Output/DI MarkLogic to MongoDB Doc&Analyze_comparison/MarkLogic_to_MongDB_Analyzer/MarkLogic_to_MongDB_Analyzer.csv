Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-200,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analysis with similar scope and depth. Agent 1 presents a more structured markdown format while Agent 2 includes additional metadata like API cost and complete code reference. Both cover essential migration aspects: schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing strategy, query translation, performance considerations, and actionable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-200,"Both outputs address identical migration goals with similar technical depth. Core concepts like XML-to-BSON mapping, indexing strategies, and query translations are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on challenges (line 45-50), Agent 2 provides more concrete examples (line 89-120). Both reach same conclusions about feasibility and approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,1-200,"Both follow similar 7-section structure: Schema Analysis → Data Model Mapping → Indexing → Query Analysis → Performance → Dependencies → Recommendations. Agent 1 uses more hierarchical markdown (### subsections), Agent 2 has flatter structure with cleaner formatting. Agent 2 includes unique sections like API cost (line 3) and complete code reference (line 180-200) not present in Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-150,"Valid markdown syntax throughout. Proper XML and JSON code blocks. Consistent internal structure. Minor formatting inconsistency in line 85 where closing markdown block could be cleaner. All references and examples are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,1-200,"Excellent syntax and formatting. Clean section headers, proper code blocks, consistent structure. API cost metadata properly formatted (line 3). Complete XQuery code reference is syntactically valid (lines 180-200). No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper formatting and valid code examples."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,45-50,"Enhance challenge identification sections with more specific technical details and mitigation strategies for namespace handling and hierarchical data restructuring."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,3-5,"Consider removing or contextualizing API cost metadata if not relevant to all readers. Excellent inclusion of complete code reference enhances practical value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-200,"Both outputs provide excellent migration guidance. Consider combining Agent 1's detailed challenge analysis with Agent 2's practical code examples and cleaner formatting for optimal result."
