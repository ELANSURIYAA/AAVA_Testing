Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration analysis reports with similar scope and depth. Agent 1 delivers a well-structured analysis covering all essential migration aspects, while Agent 2 provides enhanced detail with API cost tracking and complete code reference. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding and provide actionable migration guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing MarkLogic to MongoDB migration. They cover identical key areas: schema analysis, data model mapping, indexing strategy, query analysis, performance considerations, and recommendations. The semantic intent and technical approach are highly aligned, with both providing XML-to-BSON conversion examples and equivalent MongoDB queries. Minor differences exist in presentation style and additional features like API cost tracking in Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow similar logical structure with main sections for Schema Analysis, Data Model Mapping, Indexing Strategy, Query Analysis, Performance Considerations, and Recommendations. Agent 1 uses a more traditional report structure with numbered sections, while Agent 2 includes additional elements like API cost at the beginning and complete code reference at the end. The core analytical flow and section decomposition are highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,,"Agent 1 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness. XML and JSON examples are properly formatted with correct namespace declarations. MongoDB query syntax is accurate. Minor issue: Line 45 shows incomplete range index discussion without specific implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,97,,"Agent 2 output shows superior syntactic correctness with properly formatted XML, JSON, and JavaScript code blocks. All MongoDB queries use correct syntax. The complete MarkLogic code reference (lines 180-250) is syntactically valid XQuery. Only minor formatting inconsistency in the API cost section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid code examples and proper formatting. Agent 2 slightly edges ahead with more comprehensive code validation and complete reference implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,,"Strengthen range index implementation details and provide more specific MongoDB optimization strategies. Consider adding performance benchmarking guidelines."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,,"Maintain the comprehensive approach while ensuring consistent formatting across all sections. The API cost tracking and complete code reference are valuable additions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs provide excellent migration analysis. Agent 2's additional features (API cost, complete code reference) provide enhanced value, while Agent 1's streamlined approach offers clear readability. Consider combining Agent 1's clarity with Agent 2's comprehensive features for optimal results."
