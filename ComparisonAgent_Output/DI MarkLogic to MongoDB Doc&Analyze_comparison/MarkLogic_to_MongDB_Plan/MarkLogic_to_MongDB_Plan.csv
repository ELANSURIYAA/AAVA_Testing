Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-150","Both agents provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration plans with similar semantic intent (85/100). Agent_1 offers a structured approach with clear sections and effort estimation totaling 120 hours. Agent_2 provides more detailed technical specifications with 46 hours estimation and specific pricing breakdowns. Structural approaches differ significantly - Agent_1 uses narrative format while Agent_2 employs structured tables and technical specifications. Both outputs are syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting and logical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 75-100","Both outputs address the same core objective of migrating from MarkLogic to MongoDB. Agent_1 focuses on comprehensive analysis with 7 key functions identified and detailed syntax differences. Agent_2 provides more technical depth with namespace analysis and structured function mapping. Both cover CRUD operations, search functionality, and XML to JSON transformation. Key semantic alignment includes: document operations mapping, query translation needs, indexing strategy requirements, and manual intervention areas. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent_1 emphasizes business planning while Agent_2 focuses on technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 10-30, 60-80, 120-140","Significant structural differences between outputs. Agent_1 uses a narrative documentation approach with numbered sections (1-4) covering Analysis, Effort Estimation, Pricing, and Recommendations. Agent_2 employs a more technical specification format with detailed tables, structured subsections (1.1, 1.2, etc.), and comprehensive reference materials. Agent_1 flows: Analysis → Estimation → Pricing → Recommendations. Agent_2 flows: Analysis → Effort Tables → Pricing Breakdown → Migration Steps → Summary Table. Both maintain logical progression but use fundamentally different organizational structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 25, 45, 78","Agent_1 output is well-formatted documentation with proper markdown syntax, consistent heading hierarchy, and logical flow. Minor issues: Line 25 - inconsistent bullet formatting in syntax differences section. Line 45 - effort estimation could benefit from more granular breakdown. Line 78 - pricing section lacks specific regional considerations. Overall structure is sound with proper section numbering and clear transitions between topics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 15, 89","Agent_2 output demonstrates excellent technical documentation standards with proper markdown tables, consistent formatting, and comprehensive structure. Very minor issues: Line 15 - table alignment could be improved for readability. Line 89 - one minor inconsistency in effort hour totals across different sections (26+20=46 vs other references). Excellent use of structured tables, proper reference sections, and actionable recommendations with specific technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper documentation formatting, logical structure, and technical accuracy. Agent_2 slightly edges out with more consistent technical specifications and structured presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,85,"Lines 120-150","Agent_1 provides solid migration planning with comprehensive coverage of key areas. Recommendations: 1) Add more granular effort breakdowns similar to Agent_2's approach. 2) Include specific technical implementation details and code examples. 3) Enhance pricing analysis with regional and scaling considerations. 4) Add structured tables for better readability and technical specifications. 5) Include more detailed testing strategies and validation approaches."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,88,"Lines 140-180","Agent_2 delivers excellent technical depth and structured approach. Recommendations: 1) Consider adding more business context and stakeholder communication strategies. 2) Include risk mitigation strategies for complex migration scenarios. 3) Add timeline and resource allocation details beyond effort hours. 4) Enhance the executive summary for non-technical stakeholders. 5) Consider adding post-migration optimization and monitoring strategies beyond basic setup."
