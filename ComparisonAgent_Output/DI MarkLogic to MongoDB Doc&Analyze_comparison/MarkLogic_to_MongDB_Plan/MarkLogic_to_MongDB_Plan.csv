Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration plans with similar core objectives but different approaches. Agent_1_Migration_Plan offers a more concise overview with basic effort estimation, while Agent_2_Migration_Plan provides significantly more detailed analysis including structured tables, specific pricing breakdowns, and actionable implementation steps."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,,"Both outputs address the identical migration goal and cover the same fundamental areas: MarkLogic script analysis, effort estimation, cost analysis, and recommendations. However, Agent_2_Migration_Plan demonstrates deeper understanding with more granular analysis of syntax differences (lines 25-35), specific pricing tiers (lines 85-95), and detailed action items (lines 140-150). Agent_1_Migration_Plan provides broader conceptual coverage but lacks the implementation specificity found in Agent_2_Migration_Plan."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs follow similar high-level organization with numbered sections for analysis, effort estimation, and recommendations. However, structural approaches differ significantly. Agent_1_Migration_Plan uses a flatter structure with basic subsections, while Agent_2_Migration_Plan employs hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.), comparison tables (lines 25-35), and structured breakdowns (lines 45-65 for effort estimation). Agent_2_Migration_Plan includes additional structural elements like summary tables (lines 120-135) and specific action items (lines 140-150) that Agent_1_Migration_Plan lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Migration_Plan,95,,"Agent_1_Migration_Plan demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and well-formed content structure. Minor issues include inconsistent formatting in the pricing section (lines 85-95) and some repetitive phrasing in recommendations (lines 110-120)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Migration_Plan,98,,"Agent_2_Migration_Plan exhibits excellent syntactic correctness with consistent hierarchical numbering, properly formatted tables, and comprehensive section organization. All markdown elements are correctly structured, references are consistent, and the document maintains professional formatting throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_2_Migration_Plan slightly edges ahead with more polished presentation and comprehensive structural elements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Migration_Plan,,"Enhance the migration plan by adding more detailed implementation steps, specific pricing breakdowns with tier recommendations, and structured comparison tables for better clarity. Consider adding action items section and more granular effort estimation tables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Migration_Plan,,"The migration plan is comprehensive and well-structured. Minor improvements could include adding more visual elements or diagrams to illustrate the migration flow, and potentially expanding on error handling strategies during the migration process."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both plans would benefit from including risk assessment sections, rollback procedures, and more detailed timeline planning. Consider adding stakeholder communication templates and success metrics for measuring migration effectiveness."
