Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration plans with similar core objectives but different structural approaches and levels of detail. Agent_Output_1 provides a more streamlined approach while Agent_Output_2 offers more granular technical specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-50, 60-80","Both outputs address the same migration objective and cover similar functional areas (script analysis, effort estimation, pricing, recommendations). However, Agent_Output_1 estimates 120 total hours while Agent_Output_2 estimates 46 hours, showing significant divergence in effort assessment. Both identify similar MarkLogic functions and MongoDB equivalents."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 10-30, 40-70","Agent_Output_1 uses a simpler 4-section structure with basic formatting, while Agent_Output_2 employs a more sophisticated 7-section structure with detailed subsections, tables, and hierarchical organization. The logical flow is similar but presentation differs substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_1,95,"Lines 15, 45, 78","Minor formatting inconsistencies in section numbering and some informal language usage, but overall syntactically sound with proper structure and no broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_2,98,"Lines 25, 89","Highly structured with consistent formatting, proper table syntax, and professional technical documentation standards. Minor issue with table alignment in line 89."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_1,,"Lines 85-95","Consider adopting the more detailed effort breakdown methodology from Agent_Output_2 to improve accuracy of time estimates. The 120-hour estimate may be inflated compared to the more granular 46-hour breakdown."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_2,,"Lines 120-140","Excellent technical structure and detail. Consider adding more narrative explanation of complex concepts to improve accessibility for non-technical stakeholders, similar to Agent_Output_1's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from alignment on effort estimation methodology. Consider combining Agent_Output_1's accessible explanations with Agent_Output_2's detailed technical specifications for an optimal migration plan."
