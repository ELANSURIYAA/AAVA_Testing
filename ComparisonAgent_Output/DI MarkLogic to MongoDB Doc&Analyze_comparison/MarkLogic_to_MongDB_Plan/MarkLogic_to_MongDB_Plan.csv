Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic to MongoDB migration plans with similar core components: script analysis, effort estimation, cost analysis, and recommendations. Agent_Comprehensive offers a more streamlined approach with 60+60=120 hours total effort estimation, while Agent_Detailed provides more granular analysis with 26+20=46 hours estimation. Both identify key migration challenges including XML to JSON transformation, namespace handling, and query conversion."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-150,"Both outputs address identical migration objectives with similar technical approaches. Key semantic alignments include: (1) MarkLogic script analysis covering CRUD operations and search functionality (lines 5-25 both outputs), (2) XML to JSON/BSON transformation requirements (lines 45-60), (3) MongoDB Atlas pricing considerations (lines 90-120), and (4) structured migration recommendations. Minor divergence in cost estimates: Agent_Comprehensive suggests enterprise DBU costs while Agent_Detailed provides specific M60/M80 cluster pricing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-150,"Both outputs follow similar logical progression: analysis → effort estimation → pricing → recommendations. However, structural differences exist: Agent_Comprehensive uses numbered sections (1-4) with subsections, while Agent_Detailed employs hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1, etc.) with tables. Agent_Comprehensive presents information in prose format (lines 1-80), while Agent_Detailed uses structured tables and bullet points (lines 30-100). Both conclude with actionable recommendations but in different formats."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive,95,1-150,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and well-formed lists. Minor issues: (1) Inconsistent spacing in some bullet points (line 45), (2) Missing table formatting for cost breakdown which could improve readability (line 110). All internal references are consistent and technical terminology is accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Detailed,98,1-150,"Excellent syntactic structure with proper markdown formatting, consistent hierarchical numbering, well-formed tables, and clear section breaks. Minor issue: (1) One inconsistent table alignment in pricing section (line 95). All internal references are consistent, technical terminology is accurate, and table structures are properly formatted throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper documentation structure and formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive,,45-60,"Consider adopting more structured presentation format with tables for cost breakdowns and effort estimations to improve readability and professional appearance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Detailed,,30-100,"Maintain the excellent structured approach with hierarchical numbering and tables. Consider adding more specific examples of XML to JSON transformation patterns to enhance practical value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide solid migration foundations. Recommend combining Agent_Comprehensive's streamlined narrative approach with Agent_Detailed's structured presentation format for optimal documentation quality."
