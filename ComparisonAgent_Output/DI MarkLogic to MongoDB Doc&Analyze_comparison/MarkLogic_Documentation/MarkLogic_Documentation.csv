Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic database documentation covering similar core topics including overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, complexity analysis, and error handling. Agent 1 provides a more traditional structured approach with clear section divisions, while Agent 2 offers more detailed technical implementation with complete code examples and tabular data flow mappings. Both documents serve as valuable resources for understanding MarkLogic implementation but differ in presentation style and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of documenting a MarkLogic database implementation. They cover identical functional areas: document management, XQuery operations, search capabilities, and CRUD operations. The semantic intent is highly aligned with both focusing on XML document handling, namespace usage (http://example.com/ns), and similar function purposes (load, insert, search, update, delete). Minor divergence exists in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses more on conceptual overview while Agent 2 provides deeper technical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 5-25 (Agent 1), Lines 8-35 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Performance, Complexity, and Error Handling sections. However, Agent 1 uses a more traditional documentation approach with numbered sections (1. Overview, 2. Code Structure, etc.) while Agent 2 uses markdown headers without numbering. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like tabular data flow mappings (lines 85-95) and complete code reference section (lines 140-180) that Agent 1 lacks. The logical flow is similar but presentation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 45-60, 95-110","Agent 1 demonstrates good syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid technical references. Minor issues include: incomplete error handling discussion (lines 95-100) without specific implementation guidance, and generic recommendations (lines 130-135) that could be more actionable. All MarkLogic function references are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 140-200","Agent 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with complete, valid XQuery code examples that include proper namespace declarations, function signatures, and MarkLogic API usage. The code block (lines 140-200) is syntactically valid and executable. Minor formatting inconsistencies in table structure (lines 85-95) but overall maintains high technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with valid MarkLogic references and proper documentation structure. Agent 2 edges ahead with complete executable code examples while Agent 1 maintains consistency in documentation formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance technical depth by adding complete code examples similar to Agent 2. Improve actionability of recommendations with specific implementation steps. Consider adding tabular summaries for complex data flow mappings."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Improve structural consistency by adopting numbered section headers for better navigation. Ensure table formatting consistency throughout the document. Consider adding more conceptual overview content to balance technical detail."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both documents would benefit from: 1) Standardized error handling examples with try-catch blocks, 2) Performance benchmarking data for optimization recommendations, 3) Cross-references between sections for better navigation, 4) Version control and change management guidance for production deployments."
