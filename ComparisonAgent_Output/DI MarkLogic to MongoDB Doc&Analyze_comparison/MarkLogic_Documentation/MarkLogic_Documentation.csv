Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive MarkLogic database documentation covering similar core concepts including XQuery functions, document management, search capabilities, and system architecture. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in purpose and technical content, with structural differences in organization and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both documents address MarkLogic database implementation with XQuery-based document management. Core concepts are semantically equivalent: XML document storage, namespace usage (http://example.com/ns), CRUD operations, and search functionality using cts:word-query. Agent 2 provides more detailed code examples and technical specifications, while Agent 1 focuses on conceptual overview. Minor divergence in emphasis on performance optimization and error handling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-20 (headers), Lines 50-80 (code structure)","Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-6) with subsections, following a traditional documentation structure. Agent 2 employs markdown headers with tables and embedded code blocks, providing more granular organization. Both cover similar topics but in different sequences: Agent 1 progresses from overview to complexity analysis, while Agent 2 includes detailed data flow mapping tables and complete code reference sections. Structural approach differs significantly in presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 45-60 (XQuery references), Lines 120-135 (function names)","Documentation is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid XQuery function references (xdmp:document-load, cts:word-query), and consistent namespace usage. Minor issue: Line 58 references 'cts:word-query' without full context explanation. All internal references and section cross-references are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 80-150 (code blocks), Lines 160-180 (function definitions)","Highly accurate documentation with complete XQuery code examples, proper syntax highlighting, and comprehensive function definitions. All namespace declarations are correct, function signatures match MarkLogic standards, and code examples are executable. Minor formatting inconsistency in table alignment at lines 95-100."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both documents demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid MarkLogic references, proper markdown formatting, and accurate technical content. Average of individual scores reflects strong technical accuracy across both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance structural organization by adding data flow tables and complete code examples similar to Agent 2. Include more detailed performance optimization sections and expand error handling examples with specific try-catch implementations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach while improving table formatting consistency. Consider adding conceptual overview sections similar to Agent 1 for better accessibility to non-technical stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both documents would benefit from: 1) Standardized section numbering for easier cross-referencing, 2) Integration of Agent 1's conceptual clarity with Agent 2's technical depth, 3) Addition of visual diagrams for data flow and architecture components, 4) Consistent code formatting and syntax highlighting standards."
