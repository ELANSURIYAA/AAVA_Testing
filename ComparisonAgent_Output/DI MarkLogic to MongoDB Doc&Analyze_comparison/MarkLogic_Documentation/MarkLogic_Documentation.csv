Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic database documentation covering similar core topics: overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, complexity analysis, and error handling. Agent 1 presents a more traditional documentation structure with separate Code Analysis section, while Agent 2 integrates complete code reference within the main flow and uses tabular data flow mapping. Both outputs address the same fundamental MarkLogic implementation requirements but with different organizational approaches and levels of technical detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-180 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the same MarkLogic database implementation with identical core concepts: XML document management, XQuery functions, namespace usage, and CRUD operations. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Same namespace 'http://example.com/ns', (2) Identical function purposes (load, insert, search, update, delete), (3) Same MarkLogic APIs usage (xdmp:document-*, cts:word-query), (4) Similar performance and error handling discussions. Semantic differences: Agent 2 provides more detailed code examples and structured data flow tables, while Agent 1 focuses more on conceptual explanations and separate code analysis section."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 10-45 (Agent 1), Lines 15-50 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar high-level documentation structure with Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Performance, Complexity, and Error Handling sections. Structural differences: (1) Agent 1 uses separate 'Code Analysis' section (lines 85-95) listing functions, while Agent 2 integrates complete code within main flow (lines 120-170), (2) Agent 2 uses tabular format for data flow mapping (lines 60-75) vs Agent 1's numbered list approach (lines 50-65), (3) Agent 2 includes 'Complete Code Reference' section with full XQuery implementation, (4) Section ordering varies - Agent 1 places recommendations at end, Agent 2 integrates throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 85-95, 40-50","Agent 1 syntax is correct with proper markdown formatting, valid section headers, and consistent internal references. Minor issues: (1) Line 42 - 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' appears to be a formatting artifact, (2) Function descriptions in Code Analysis section are accurate but lack parameter details, (3) All MarkLogic API references are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 120-170, 60-75","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with valid XQuery code, proper markdown tables, and consistent formatting. The complete code reference section (lines 120-170) contains syntactically valid XQuery with correct namespace declarations, function signatures, and MarkLogic API usage. Table formatting in data flow section is properly structured. No significant syntax issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper markdown formatting and accurate technical references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance documentation by: (1) Adding complete code examples similar to Agent 2's approach, (2) Removing formatting artifacts like 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt', (3) Including parameter details in function descriptions, (4) Consider tabular format for data flow mapping for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Maintain current high-quality approach. Minor improvements: (1) Consider adding separate code analysis summary section for quick reference, (2) Ensure consistent section ordering matches traditional documentation patterns, (3) Add more conceptual explanations for complex XQuery operations to balance technical detail with accessibility."
