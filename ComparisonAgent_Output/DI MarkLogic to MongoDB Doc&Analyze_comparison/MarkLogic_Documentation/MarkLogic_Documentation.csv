Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive MarkLogic database documentation covering similar core topics including overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, complexity analysis, and error handling. Agent 1 presents a more traditional documentation structure with clear sections and subsections, while Agent 2 provides more detailed code examples and technical implementation details. The outputs show high semantic alignment in purpose and content coverage, moderate structural differences in organization and presentation, and both demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of documenting a MarkLogic database implementation with XQuery functions. They cover identical key components (documents, collections, indexes, queries, APIs) and similar business alignment for document management and search. Agent 1 focuses more on conceptual overview and recommendations (lines 1-15, 95-105), while Agent 2 provides more technical depth with complete code examples (lines 80-150). The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor differences in emphasis - Agent 1 is more documentation-focused while Agent 2 is more implementation-focused."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,All,"Both outputs follow a logical documentation structure but with notable organizational differences. Agent 1 uses a traditional 6-section approach: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow & Mapping, Performance Optimization, Complexity Analysis, Error Handling & Logging (lines 1-95). Agent 2 uses a similar but more detailed structure with additional subsections and a complete code reference section (lines 1-180). Both include recommendations sections. The flow is comparable but Agent 2 provides more granular subsections and technical detail, while Agent 1 maintains a higher-level conceptual flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,All,"Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured sections. All section headers are properly formatted (lines 1, 17, 45, 67, 78, 89), bullet points are correctly structured (lines 8-12, 20-25), and internal cross-references are consistent. Minor formatting inconsistency in the code analysis section where function descriptions could be better structured (lines 95-102)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,All,"Agent 2 shows superior syntactic correctness with excellent markdown formatting, proper code block syntax highlighting, well-structured tables (lines 45-55), and comprehensive code examples with correct XQuery syntax (lines 80-150). All section headers are properly formatted, internal references are consistent, and the complete code reference section demonstrates proper namespace declarations and function definitions. Very minor issue with table formatting alignment in the data flow section (line 47)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and internal consistency. Agent 2 slightly outperforms Agent 1 due to more comprehensive code examples and better table formatting. Average score reflects strong technical writing quality across both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 95-105,"Strengthen the code analysis section by providing more detailed function descriptions and consider adding actual code examples to complement the conceptual documentation. The recommendations section is well-structured but could benefit from more specific implementation guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 1-180,"Excellent technical depth and code examples. Consider adding more conceptual overview content to balance the technical detail. The data flow table could benefit from improved formatting alignment for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized error handling examples in code sections, 2) More specific performance benchmarking data, 3) Enhanced monitoring and logging implementation details, 4) Cross-references between conceptual sections and code examples for better navigation."
