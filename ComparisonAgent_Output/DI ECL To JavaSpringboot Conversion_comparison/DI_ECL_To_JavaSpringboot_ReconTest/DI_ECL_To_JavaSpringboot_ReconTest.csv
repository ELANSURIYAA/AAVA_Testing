Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs implement Java Spring Boot applications for ECL to Java migration validation with comprehensive functionality including sample input generation, code execution, AWS deployment, output comparison, and report generation. Agent 1 uses a REST API approach with separate endpoints, while Agent 2 uses a CommandLineRunner for sequential execution. Both achieve the same core objectives with different architectural patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both applications address identical core requirements: ECL to Java migration validation, sample input generation, code execution on AWS EC2, output comparison, and report generation. Agent 1 implements REST endpoints for each validation step, while Agent 2 uses a sequential CommandLineRunner approach. The semantic intent is nearly identical - both generate sample inputs covering edge cases, execute ECL and Java code, deploy to AWS EC2, compare outputs with row count and column validation, calculate match percentages, and generate detailed reports. Minor semantic differences include Agent 1's interactive API design vs Agent 2's batch processing approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both applications follow similar high-level structure with identical functional components: SampleInputGenerator, EclExecutor, JavaExecutor, AWS deployment logic, OutputComparator, validation, and ReportGenerator. However, structural differences are significant: Agent 1 uses @RestController with separate endpoints (lines 33-82), while Agent 2 uses CommandLineRunner with sequential execution (lines 34-75). Agent 1 has more granular class separation and REST-specific data structures (ComparisonRequest, ComparisonReport, ValidationSummary at lines 170-240), while Agent 2 has simpler data classes (ColumnMismatch, ValidationResult, ComparisonResult at lines 120-150). Both use similar AWS SDK imports and Spring Boot configuration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 1-10, 15-32, 85-169","Agent 1 demonstrates excellent Java syntax with proper package declaration, complete imports including AWS SDK, Spring Boot annotations, and well-structured REST endpoints. All class definitions are syntactically correct with proper getter/setter methods. Minor issues include potential null pointer risks in OutputComparator.compare() method around line 130 when accessing map values without null checks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 1-15, 30-33, 76-119","Agent 2 shows good Java syntax with proper package structure, Spring Boot configuration, and CommandLineRunner implementation. The code includes proper exception handling and logging. Issues include incomplete JSON utility implementation (JsonUtil class at lines 200-220 has dummy implementations), missing proper JSON parsing in readJsonFromFile method, and potential IOException handling gaps in file operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both applications demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper Java structure, Spring Boot configuration, and AWS SDK integration. Agent 1 scores slightly higher due to more complete implementation details, while Agent 2 has some placeholder implementations in utility classes. Both handle the core validation logic correctly with appropriate error handling and logging."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,Lines 130-140,"Enhance null safety in OutputComparator.compare() method by adding proper null checks before accessing map values. Consider adding input validation for REST endpoints to prevent malformed requests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,Lines 200-220,"Complete the JsonUtil implementation by replacing dummy methods with proper JSON parsing using Jackson or Gson libraries. Add comprehensive error handling for file I/O operations and improve exception propagation in the main execution flow."
