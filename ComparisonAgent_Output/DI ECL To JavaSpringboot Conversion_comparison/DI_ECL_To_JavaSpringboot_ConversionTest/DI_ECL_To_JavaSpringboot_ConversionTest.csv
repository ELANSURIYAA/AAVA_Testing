Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide JUnit test cases for Constants class validation in Java Spring Boot applications. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage with 10 test cases vs Agent 1's 5, including ECL conversion validation, immutability testing, and performance testing. Agent 1 focuses heavily on REST API testing with MockMvc while Agent 2 takes a broader approach covering static field validation, instantiation prevention, and regression testing. Agent 2 demonstrates better test organization and documentation practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"","Both outputs address Constants class testing but with different scopes. Agent 1 emphasizes REST API endpoint testing (lines 45-70) and controller behavior, while Agent 2 focuses on static field validation (lines 25-35) and ECL conversion equivalence (lines 95-105). Agent 2 includes additional concepts like immutability testing (lines 75-85) and performance validation (lines 135-145) not present in Agent 1. The core intent of validating constant values is shared, but Agent 2 provides broader test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"","Agent 1 uses three separate test classes (ConstantsControllerTest, ConstantsTest, ConstantsResponseTest) with MockMvc setup (lines 20-25), while Agent 2 consolidates into one main ConstantsTest class with helper classes (lines 120-130). Agent 1 follows controller-service-model separation, Agent 2 uses a more linear approach. Both use proper JUnit 5 annotations and assertions, but Agent 2 has better test case documentation with tabular format (lines 10-20)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 65, 95","Minor syntax issues: jsonPath assertion for null values (line 95) uses complex chaining that may not work as expected. MockMvc setup in TC_004 and TC_005 creates inline controllers which adds complexity. Overall structure and imports are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Line 85","Clean JUnit 5 syntax throughout. Minor issue with reflection-based instantiation test (line 85) where exception handling could be more specific. All imports, annotations, and assertions are properly structured."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 45-70, 95","Simplify MockMvc test setup by using standard @WebMvcTest patterns. Fix jsonPath null value assertions (line 95) to use proper null checking. Consider separating REST API tests from unit tests for better organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 85, 105","Enhance reflection-based instantiation test (line 85) with more specific exception handling. Consider adding actual REST API integration tests to complement static field validation. The regression test (line 105) could be more concrete with actual ECL conversion examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Agent_2 provides more comprehensive test coverage and should be preferred. Both outputs would benefit from integration - combining Agent_1's REST API testing approach with Agent_2's comprehensive static validation. Consider standardizing on Agent_2's documentation format and test organization while incorporating Agent_1's MockMvc testing patterns."
