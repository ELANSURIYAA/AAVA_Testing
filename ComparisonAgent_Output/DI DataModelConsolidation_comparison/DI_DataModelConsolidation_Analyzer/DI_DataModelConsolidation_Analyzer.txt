# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

The comparison reveals two fundamentally different outputs addressing the same data model consolidation task. The schema mapping output delivers a comprehensive analysis with detailed table mappings across Data Lake layers, while the access limitation output explains technical constraints preventing analysis completion. These outputs serve completely different purposes - one provides deliverable results, the other explains why analysis cannot be performed.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 15/100)

The outputs have fundamentally different semantic intent with no meaningful overlap. The schema mapping output provides complete data model consolidation analysis with table-to-DataLake mappings and uniqueness identification across Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, and EDW_Staging layers. The access limitation output explains technical inability to access required DDL files. One delivers analysis results while the other explains why analysis cannot be performed.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 25/100)

Completely different structural approaches with no alignment. The schema mapping output uses structured markdown with organized headers (## Table-to-DataLake Mapping, ## DataLake Uniqueness), detailed tables with columns for Table Name, Column Name, Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, EDW_Staging, and Remarks. The access limitation output uses simple explanatory format with problem statement and bulleted next steps for resolution.

### Correctness

**Schema Mapping Output (Score: 95/100)**: Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some table headers (lines 5-10, 25-30), but all markdown syntax is valid with well-formed table structures and proper column alignments.

**Access Limitation Output (Score: 100/100)**: Perfectly formatted explanatory text with proper grammar, clear structure, and appropriate use of bullet points. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 98/100)**: Average of individual scores demonstrates high syntactic quality across both outputs.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Schema Mapping Output | Access Limitation Output | Overall |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 25 |
| Correctness | 95 | 100 | 98 |
| **Overall** | **70** | **72** | **71** |

## Recommendations

**For Schema Mapping Output**: The comprehensive analysis could benefit from an executive summary section and more detailed explanations of data type variances mentioned in the remarks column. Consider adding metadata about analysis scope and methodology.

**For Access Limitation Output**: While the constraint explanation is clear, it could include specific steps for resolving DDL file access issues and alternative analysis approaches when primary data sources are unavailable.
