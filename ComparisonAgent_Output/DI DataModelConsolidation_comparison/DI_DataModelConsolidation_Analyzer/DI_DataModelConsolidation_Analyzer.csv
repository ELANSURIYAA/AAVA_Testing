Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15,"Agent 1 delivers comprehensive schema-level comparison with detailed table mappings across Data Lake, Lakehouse, and Data Warehouse layers. Agent 2 explains inability to access DDL files and cannot complete analysis. Outputs serve completely different purposes - one provides requested deliverable while other explains technical limitations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15,"Agent 1 provides comprehensive schema analysis with table-to-DataLake mapping covering 16 tables and detailed uniqueness analysis across three data layers. Agent 2 states inability to proceed due to DDL file access limitations. Semantic alignment is minimal as outputs address different aspects - deliverable vs limitation explanation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15,"Agent 1 follows structured documentation format with clear sections: Table-to-DataLake Mapping (lines 6-150), DataLake Uniqueness with subsections for Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, and EDW_Staging. Agent 2 uses basic explanatory structure with problem statement and proposed solution steps. Structural approaches are fundamentally different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 6-150,"Well-formatted markdown tables with consistent column headers (Table Name, Column Name, Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, EDW_Staging, Remarks). Proper data type specifications (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE). Minor spacing inconsistencies in some table rows."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-15,"Grammatically correct explanation of technical limitations. Clear problem statement and proposed solution steps. No syntax or formatting errors in the explanatory text."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 6-150,"Excellent comprehensive analysis delivery. Consider adding data type variance details and constraint information for enhanced completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 1-15,"Clear communication of limitations. Should include alternative approaches or workarounds when primary method fails."
