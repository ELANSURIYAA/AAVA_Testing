Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-10","Agent DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer delivered a comprehensive schema-level comparison with detailed table mappings across Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, and EDW_Staging layers, including uniqueness analysis. Agent Failed_Access_Agent provided only an explanation of inability to access required DDL files without attempting the core analysis task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-10","DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer fully addresses the schema comparison requirements with comprehensive table-to-DataLake mappings and uniqueness analysis. Failed_Access_Agent completely fails to address the task, providing only access limitation explanations. Massive semantic divergence as one agent completes the task while the other abandons it entirely."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-10","DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer follows proper markdown structure with organized sections (Table-to-DataLake Mapping, DataLake Uniqueness with subsections). Failed_Access_Agent has basic prose structure but no task-relevant organization. Fundamental structural mismatch between comprehensive analysis and simple explanation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer,95,"Lines 5-10, 25-30","Markdown syntax is correct with proper table formatting, consistent column alignment, and valid structure. Minor issue: some table cells have inconsistent spacing in remarks column."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Failed_Access_Agent,100,"Lines 1-10","Prose is syntactically correct with proper grammar, punctuation, and paragraph structure. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer,,"Lines 1-150","Excellent task completion. Minor improvement: standardize table cell spacing and consider adding data type comparison summary statistics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Failed_Access_Agent,,"Lines 1-10","Complete task failure. Recommendation: Implement file access error handling and fallback mechanisms to attempt partial analysis even with limited data access."
