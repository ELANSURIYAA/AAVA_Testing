Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15","Agent 1 delivers comprehensive schema-level comparison across Data Lake layers with detailed table mappings and uniqueness analysis. Agent 2 explains inability to proceed due to DDL file access limitations. Outputs serve completely different purposes - one provides deliverable results, other explains technical constraints."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15","Fundamentally different semantic intent. Agent 1 provides complete data model consolidation analysis with table-to-DataLake mappings and uniqueness identification. Agent 2 explains technical inability to access required DDL files. No overlap in meaning or purpose - one delivers analysis results, other explains why analysis cannot be performed."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-150 vs Lines 1-15","Completely different structural approaches. Agent 1 uses structured markdown with headers (## Table-to-DataLake Mapping, ## DataLake Uniqueness), detailed tables with columns for Table Name, Column Name, Raw_Lakehouse, Landing_Lake, EDW_Staging, and Remarks. Agent 2 uses simple explanatory format with problem statement and bulleted next steps. No structural alignment between comprehensive analysis format and constraint explanation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,schema_mapping_output,95,"Lines 5-10, 25-30","Syntactically correct markdown with proper table formatting. Minor issue: some table headers could be more consistently formatted. All markdown syntax valid, table structures well-formed, column alignments proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,access_limitation_output,100,"Lines 1-15","Perfectly formatted explanatory text with proper grammar, clear structure, and appropriate use of bullet points. No syntax errors or formatting issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98"

Recommendations,Recommendation,schema_mapping_output,,"Lines 1-150","Output provides comprehensive analysis but could benefit from executive summary section and data type variance explanations in remarks column."
Recommendations,Recommendation,access_limitation_output,,"Lines 1-15","Output clearly explains constraints but could include specific steps for resolving DDL file access issues and alternative analysis approaches."
