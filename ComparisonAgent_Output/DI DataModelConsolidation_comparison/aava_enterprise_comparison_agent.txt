- 1 pair genuinely matched and fully compared; 1 file could not be matched due to missing or incomplete content.
- The matched pair demonstrates strong equivalence, with only minor structural and documentation differences.
- One unmatched file (Analyzer) flagged as "Not Comparable" due to insufficient content in AAVA 2.0.
- Migration safety is conditional, limited by incomplete comparison.
- Critical attention required for unmatched/uncertain artifacts before full migration approval.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a rigorous comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs for Data Model Consolidation components. Using strict input validation and multi-gate matching, the analysis confirms a genuine one-to-one match for the Recommender component, with strong alignment across business logic, data flow, and technical implementation. However, the Analyzer component in AAVA 1.0 could not be matched due to missing or incomplete content in AAVA 2.0, limiting the completeness of the assessment. The matched pair supports migration with low risk, but the presence of unmatched files warrants caution.

Note: 1 file could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- The Recommender component is strongly aligned and ready for migration.
- Analyzer component could not be validated, introducing risk.
- Confidence level is conditional due to incomplete matching.
- Recommendation: Proceed with migration for matched components; review unmatched artifacts.
- Business continuity is supported for matched areas but not guaranteed for the full workflow.

Unmatched Files Detail:

| Version   | Filename                         | Reason                                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AAVA 1.0  | DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer.txt | No match in AAVA 2.0 - Gate 1 failed (content unavailable) |
| AAVA 2.0  | di_datamodelconsolidation_analyzer.txt | No match in AAVA 1.0 - Gate 1 failed (content unavailable) |

- Only the Recommender component passed all matching gates.
- Incomplete comparison due to unmatched Analyzer files.
- Unmatched files increase migration risk and reduce reliability.
- Matched pair provides dependable insight for migration of that component.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line diff is performed for genuinely matched pairs, calculating unchanged lines as a percentage of total lines. Only valid one-to-one matches are scored; unmatched files show "N/A".

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication         |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes          |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only     |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring         |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes       |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review     |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file     |

- Match % alone does not guarantee functional equivalence.
- Dimension scores provide deeper functional and technical insight.
- Both metrics are required to determine migration readiness.
- 90% threshold is required for PASS status.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element         | Value         |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Final Recommendation    | CONDITIONAL   |
| Primary Justification   | One unmatched file limits migration confidence |
| Confidence Level        | MEDIUM        |
| Recommended Timeline    | Conditional   |
| Priority                | Action Required | Responsible Team         | Timeline    |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| High                    | Manual review of Analyzer | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | Immediate   |

- Migration is approved only for the matched Recommender component.
- Manual review of Analyzer is required before full migration.
- Confidence is medium due to incomplete comparison.
- Immediate action is recommended for resolving unmatched files.
- Responsible team: Workflow Owner / AAVA Team.

This report applies strict validation and multi-gate matching to ensure all findings are evidence-based and reproducible. Migration for matched components is supported, but the presence of unmatched files requires manual intervention before full approval.
