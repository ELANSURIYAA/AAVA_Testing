- 1 genuinely matched pair; 1 unmatched file (Analyzer).
- DataModelConsolidation_Recommender components are functionally similar with minor structural/documentation differences.
- Analyzer component could not be matched due to missing corresponding artifact in AAVA 2.0 (content unavailable).
- Migration safety is conditional: matched component is low risk, but overall impact is high due to incompleteness.
- Critical review required before migration due to unmatched Analyzer.

---

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a strict, evidence-based comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow output files for DataModelConsolidation components. Using a multi-gate matching process, the Recommender artifacts were validated as a genuine one-to-one match, scoring high on functional equivalence with minor documentation and structural differences. The Analyzer component from AAVA 1.0 could not be compared, as its corresponding artifact in AAVA 2.0 was missing or inaccessible, resulting in an incomplete comparison. Migration confidence is reduced due to this gap, and a conditional recommendation is provided.

Note: 1 file could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- The Recommender modules are highly aligned, supporting migration with low risk.
- Analyzer component is missing, requiring manual review and mitigation.
- Overall confidence is medium due to incomplete input set.
- Migration is not fully safe until unmatched files are addressed.
- Business continuity is conditional; all critical logic must be present in both versions.
- Recommendation: Proceed only after resolving unmatched Analyzer component.

Unmatched Files Detail:

| Version   | Filename                          | Reason                                    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| AAVA 1.0  | DI_DataModelConsolidation_Analyzer.txt | No match in AAVA 2.0 - Gate 5 failed (missing content) |

- Only half of the components could be compared due to missing content.
- The unmatched Analyzer file increases migration risk.
- Matched pair (Recommender) passed all gates with medium confidence.
- Reliability of matched pair is high, but overall completeness is insufficient.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line diff was performed for genuinely matched pairs, counting unchanged versus changed lines. Match percentage is calculated as (Unchanged_Lines / Total_Lines) × 100, rounded to one decimal. Only valid one-to-one pairs are scored; unmatched files are marked N/A.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication      |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes       |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only  |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring      |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes    |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review  |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file    |

- Match % alone does not guarantee equivalence.
- Dimension scores provide deeper insight.
- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.
- 90% match threshold is required for PASS.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element        | Value         |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Final Recommendation   | CONDITIONAL   |
| Primary Justification  | Analyzer component missing; migration not fully safe |
| Confidence Level       | MEDIUM        |
| Recommended Timeline   | Conditional   |

| Priority | Action Required           | Responsible Team           | Timeline   |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| High     | Manual review of Analyzer| Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | Immediate  |

- Migration can proceed for Recommender component with low risk.
- Analyzer component must be reviewed and resolved before full migration.
- Confidence is medium; all business logic must be validated for completeness.
- Responsible team: Workflow Owner / AAVA Team.

This report provides a rigorous, deterministic, and strictly validated comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. Migration is conditionally approved for matched components, but full migration is not recommended until all unmatched files are resolved.
