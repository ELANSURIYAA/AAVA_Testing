Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 for both agents","Both agents successfully address data model consolidation tasks with comprehensive analysis, scoring, and implementation recommendations. Agent 1 focuses on Raw_Lakehouse/Landing_Lake/EDW_Staging comparison while Agent 2 analyzes Data Warehouse/Data Mart/Lakehouse models. Both provide actionable DDL statements and unified model proposals."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 15-25","Both outputs address identical core objectives of data model comparison and consolidation. They follow the same analytical approach with similarity scoring, best candidate identification, and implementation planning. Minor divergence in model naming conventions and specific table structures, but overall intent and methodology are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150 for both","Nearly identical document structure with matching section headers and flow. Both use: 1) Data Model Match Scores table, 2) Summary with highest match identification, 3) Tables to be Added section, 4) DDL Update Statements, 5) Unified Model Proposal. Minor differences in subsection organization and table formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 45-80","Valid markdown syntax throughout. SQL DDL CREATE statements are syntactically correct with proper table definitions, column specifications, and data types. Minor issue: missing AUTO_INCREMENT on PRIMARY KEY columns which is typically expected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 50-90","Excellent markdown syntax and structure. SQL DDL statements include both CREATE and ALTER commands with proper syntax. Includes AUTO_INCREMENT, comments, and proper constraint definitions. More comprehensive DDL implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both agents demonstrate high syntactic accuracy with proper markdown and SQL formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 1-150","Strengthen DDL statements by adding AUTO_INCREMENT to PRIMARY KEY columns and consider adding column comments for better documentation. The analysis is comprehensive but could benefit from more detailed constraint definitions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 1-150","Excellent implementation with comprehensive DDL including both CREATE and ALTER statements. The addition of comments and proper constraint handling demonstrates best practices. Consider standardizing table naming conventions across all models."
