Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both agents provide comprehensive data model consolidation reports with similarity analysis, recommended base models, and detailed DDL implementation plans. Raw_Lakehouse agent recommends Raw_Lakehouse model (95% similarity) while Data_Warehouse agent recommends Data Warehouse stg_* model (95% similarity). Both outputs demonstrate strong analytical rigor and practical implementation guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 75-100","Both outputs address identical core objectives of data model consolidation with similarity scoring and base model recommendations. Key semantic alignment includes: (1) Both provide model pair similarity percentages, (2) Both recommend highest-scoring models for consolidation, (3) Both include comprehensive table addition plans, (4) Both provide complete DDL implementation. Semantic divergence occurs in recommended base models (Raw_Lakehouse vs Data Warehouse stg_*) and specific table/column recommendations, reflecting different analytical perspectives on optimal consolidation strategy."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-25, 50-75, 100-150","Outputs demonstrate nearly identical structural organization: (1) Data Model Match Scores section with tabular similarity percentages, (2) Summary section identifying highest match score model, (3) Tables to be Added section with detailed column specifications, (4) DDL Update Statements with CREATE and ALTER commands, (5) Unified Model Proposal with implementation summary. Minor structural variations include section naming conventions and table presentation formats, but overall flow and logical decomposition are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Raw_Lakehouse,95,"Lines 60-120","SQL DDL statements are syntactically correct with proper CREATE TABLE syntax, appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE), and consistent naming conventions. Table and column names follow clear patterns. No syntax errors detected in SQL statements or table definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Data_Warehouse,92,"Line 89, Lines 95-140","SQL DDL statements are generally well-formed with proper syntax and data types. Minor issues include: (1) Line 89 contains 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting manager' which appears to be a formatting artifact, (2) Some inconsistencies in comment formatting. Otherwise, CREATE and ALTER statements follow proper SQL syntax with appropriate data type specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score reflects strong syntactic validity across both outputs with minor formatting issues in Data_Warehouse output. Both demonstrate competent SQL DDL generation with proper table structures and data type specifications."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Raw_Lakehouse,,"Lines 1-150","Strong analytical approach with clear model selection criteria. Maintain consistent naming conventions and verify all table relationships. Consider adding foreign key constraints for referential integrity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Data_Warehouse,,"Lines 1-150","Comprehensive consolidation strategy with good standardization approach. Address formatting artifacts (line 89) and ensure consistent comment formatting across all DDL statements. Validate manager_id relationships in employee tables."
