Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 1-8","Both outputs provide comprehensive data model consolidation analysis with similarity scoring and DDL recommendations. Raw_Lakehouse_Approach focuses on Raw_Lakehouse as the base model (95% similarity with Landing_Lake) while DataWarehouse_Approach uses Data Warehouse as foundation (95% similarity with Data Mart). Both follow similar analytical frameworks but differ in base model selection and naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-15, 1-12","Both outputs address identical goals of data model consolidation with similarity analysis and integration recommendations. Raw_Lakehouse_Approach recommends Raw_Lakehouse model due to flexibility and scalability, while DataWarehouse_Approach selects Data Warehouse for standardization and alignment. Core semantic intent is identical but implementation strategies differ in base model philosophy."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 16-45, 13-40","Document structures are highly similar with: 1) Match Scores tables, 2) Summary sections with tables to add, 3) DDL statements, 4) Unified model proposals. Both use tabular presentations for data organization. Minor differences in table organization and section ordering, but overall logical flow is nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Raw_Lakehouse_Approach,95,"Lines 46-85","SQL syntax is valid with proper CREATE TABLE statements, appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE), and consistent naming. All table and column definitions are well-formed. Minor issue: missing PRIMARY KEY constraints in some table definitions could be improved for completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DataWarehouse_Approach,98,"Lines 41-75","Excellent SQL syntax with proper CREATE and ALTER statements. Includes AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY constraints, comprehensive COMMENT annotations for documentation, and consistent stg_ prefix naming convention. All data types are appropriate and well-defined. Very minor formatting inconsistency in one comment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid SQL DDL statements and proper document structure. DataWarehouse_Approach has slightly better SQL practices with PRIMARY KEY constraints and comprehensive commenting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Raw_Lakehouse_Approach,,"Add PRIMARY KEY constraints to all table definitions for referential integrity. Consider adding COMMENT annotations for better documentation. Maintain the flexible schema approach but enhance with standard database practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DataWarehouse_Approach,,"Excellent SQL practices demonstrated. Consider adding more detailed justification for datatype choices in ALTER statements. The stg_ prefix convention and comprehensive commenting are exemplary practices that should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both approaches provide solid data model consolidation frameworks. DataWarehouse_Approach shows slightly better technical implementation with proper constraints and documentation. Raw_Lakehouse_Approach offers good flexibility but needs enhanced SQL practices. Consider combining the flexibility of Raw_Lakehouse with the technical rigor of DataWarehouse approach for optimal results."
