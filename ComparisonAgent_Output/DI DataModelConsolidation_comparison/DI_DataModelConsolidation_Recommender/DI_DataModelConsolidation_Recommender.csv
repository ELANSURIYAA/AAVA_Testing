Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both agents produced comprehensive data model consolidation reports with similar structural approaches but different recommended base models. Agent 1 recommends Raw_Lakehouse (95% similarity score) while Agent 2 recommends Data Warehouse/stg_* model (95% similarity score). Both outputs include match score tables, DDL statements, and unified model proposals with high technical quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-10, 45-60, 80-95","Both agents address the same core task of data model consolidation and provide similar analytical approaches. However, they reach different conclusions about the optimal base model. Agent 1 focuses on Raw_Lakehouse flexibility and scalability, while Agent 2 emphasizes Data Warehouse standardization and operational alignment. The semantic intent is highly aligned despite different recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural patterns: match score tables, summary sections, DDL statements, and unified model proposals. The organization, section headers, and logical flow are remarkably consistent. Minor differences in table formatting and some section ordering, but overall structure is highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Raw_Lakehouse,95,"Lines 25-45, 70-120","SQL DDL syntax is valid with proper CREATE TABLE statements, appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE), and consistent naming conventions. All table and column definitions are syntactically correct. Minor issue: missing PRIMARY KEY constraints in some table definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Data_Warehouse,98,"Lines 30-50, 75-130","Excellent SQL DDL syntax with proper CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements. Includes AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY constraints, comprehensive COMMENT annotations, and consistent data type usage. All SQL statements are syntactically valid and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"Lines 25-130","Both agents demonstrate high syntactic correctness in their SQL DDL statements and report structure. Agent 2 slightly edges out with more complete table definitions including primary keys and comments. No major syntax errors detected in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Raw_Lakehouse,N/A,"Lines 25-45","Enhance DDL statements by adding PRIMARY KEY constraints to all table definitions. Consider adding COMMENT annotations for better documentation. The Raw_Lakehouse approach offers good flexibility but could benefit from more standardized naming conventions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Data_Warehouse,N/A,"Lines 30-50","Excellent technical implementation with comprehensive DDL statements. The Data Warehouse approach provides strong standardization. Consider adding more justification for why stg_* prefix is optimal for all use cases beyond operational alignment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency. The choice between Raw_Lakehouse vs Data Warehouse approaches depends on organizational priorities: flexibility/scalability vs standardization/operations. Consider hybrid approach incorporating benefits of both models."
