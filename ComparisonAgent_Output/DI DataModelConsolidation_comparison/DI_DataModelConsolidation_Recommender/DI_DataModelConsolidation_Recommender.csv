Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents provide comprehensive data model consolidation recommendations with high structural similarity (92/100) and strong semantic alignment (88/100). Raw_Lakehouse_Agent focuses on Raw_Lakehouse as the optimal integration candidate with 95% similarity scores, while Data_Warehouse_Agent recommends the Data Warehouse (stg_*) model as the foundation with 95% match scores. Both outputs demonstrate excellent correctness with valid SQL DDL syntax and consistent formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of data model consolidation and provide structured recommendations. Raw_Lakehouse_Agent focuses on Raw_Lakehouse/Landing_Lake/EDW_Staging integration (lines 1-15), while Data_Warehouse_Agent addresses Data Warehouse/Data Mart/Lakehouse consolidation (lines 1-10). The semantic intent is highly aligned - both identify a primary model for integration, provide similarity scores, and recommend DDL changes. Minor divergence exists in the specific models analyzed and naming conventions used."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural patterns: (1) Data Model Match Scores table with similarity percentages (lines 1-8 in both), (2) Summary section identifying the highest match score model (lines 10-15), (3) Tables to be Added section with detailed column specifications (lines 17-45), (4) Column-Level Updates table (lines 47-55), (5) DDL Update Statements with CREATE and ALTER statements (lines 57-120), and (6) Unified Model Proposal (lines 122-140). The logical flow and decomposition approach are virtually identical, with only minor differences in table naming conventions and specific content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Raw_Lakehouse_Agent,95,57-120,"SQL DDL syntax is valid with proper CREATE TABLE statements including PRIMARY KEY constraints, appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR(255), DECIMAL(18,2), DATE), and consistent formatting. Minor issue: missing AUTO_INCREMENT on PRIMARY KEY declarations which is standard practice for ID columns. All table and column names follow consistent naming conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Data_Warehouse_Agent,98,57-120,"Excellent SQL DDL syntax with proper CREATE TABLE statements including AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY constraints, appropriate data types, comprehensive COMMENT annotations for documentation, and proper ALTER TABLE statements with MODIFY and ADD COLUMN syntax. All DDL statements are syntactically correct and follow best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid SQL DDL, consistent formatting, and proper markdown structure. Data_Warehouse_Agent shows slightly superior DDL practices with AUTO_INCREMENT and comprehensive commenting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Raw_Lakehouse_Agent,N/A,17-45,"Consider adding AUTO_INCREMENT to PRIMARY KEY declarations in CREATE TABLE statements for better database design practices. The DDL statements would benefit from adding COMMENT annotations to improve documentation and maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Data_Warehouse_Agent,N/A,1-140,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive commenting and proper DDL syntax. Consider adding more detailed justification for datatype choices and constraints. The unified model proposal could benefit from explicit foreign key relationships definition."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency in data model consolidation. Consider standardizing on consistent naming conventions across all implementations. Future iterations could benefit from including data lineage mapping and impact analysis for the proposed changes."
