Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate high-quality data model consolidation analysis with nearly identical semantic intent and structural organization. Raw_Lakehouse_Output focuses on Raw_Lakehouse vs Landing_Lake vs EDW_Staging comparison, while Data_Warehouse_Output analyzes Data Warehouse vs Data Mart vs Lakehouse models. Both provide comprehensive similarity scoring, table addition recommendations, and DDL implementation guidance with strong technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,94,"Lines 1-15, 45-60","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing data model similarities and providing consolidation recommendations. Minor semantic differences include model naming conventions (Raw_Lakehouse vs Data Warehouse) and specific similarity percentages, but overall intent and analytical approach are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,96,"Lines 1-10, 16-30, 31-44, 45-70","Structural organization is nearly identical with matching section headers, table formats, and logical flow. Both follow: Match Scores → Summary → Tables to Add → DDL Statements → Unified Proposal. Minor differences in subsection ordering and table presentation styles."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Raw_Lakehouse_Output,98,"Lines 31-44, 45-70","Excellent markdown formatting, valid SQL syntax in CREATE TABLE statements, consistent table structures, and proper data type specifications. Minor issue: missing AUTO_INCREMENT in PRIMARY KEY definitions compared to industry standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Data_Warehouse_Output,99,"Lines 45-80, 81-95","Outstanding technical accuracy with proper markdown formatting, syntactically correct SQL including AUTO_INCREMENT specifications, comprehensive ALTER TABLE statements, and detailed column comments. Excellent adherence to SQL standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98.5,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with valid syntax and consistent formatting. Data_Warehouse_Output slightly superior due to more complete SQL specifications."
