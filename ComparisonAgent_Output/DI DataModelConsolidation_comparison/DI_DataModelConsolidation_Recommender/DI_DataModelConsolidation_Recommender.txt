# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive data model consolidation reports with similarity analysis, recommended base models, and detailed DDL implementation plans. The **Raw_Lakehouse agent** recommends the Raw_Lakehouse model (95% similarity) while the **Data_Warehouse agent** recommends the Data Warehouse stg_* model (95% similarity). Both outputs demonstrate strong analytical rigor and practical implementation guidance with overall scores of 90-91/100.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address identical core objectives of data model consolidation with similarity scoring and base model recommendations. Key semantic alignment includes:

- Both provide model pair similarity percentages in tabular format
- Both recommend highest-scoring models for consolidation 
- Both include comprehensive table addition plans with detailed schemas
- Both provide complete DDL implementation with CREATE and ALTER statements

**Semantic divergence** occurs in recommended base models (Raw_Lakehouse vs Data Warehouse stg_*) and specific table/column recommendations, reflecting different analytical perspectives on optimal consolidation strategy. The Raw_Lakehouse agent focuses on flexibility and scalability, while the Data_Warehouse agent emphasizes standardization and analytical alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 90/100)

Outputs demonstrate nearly identical structural organization:

1. **Data Model Match Scores** section with tabular similarity percentages
2. **Summary** section identifying highest match score model  
3. **Tables to be Added** section with detailed column specifications
4. **DDL Update Statements** with CREATE and ALTER commands
5. **Unified Model Proposal** with implementation summary

Minor structural variations include section naming conventions and table presentation formats, but overall flow and logical decomposition are highly aligned. Both follow a clear analytical progression from assessment to recommendation to implementation.

### Correctness

**Raw_Lakehouse Agent: 95/100**
- SQL DDL statements are syntactically correct with proper CREATE TABLE syntax
- Appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE) consistently applied
- Table and column names follow clear naming patterns
- No syntax errors detected in SQL statements or table definitions

**Data_Warehouse Agent: 92/100**  
- SQL DDL statements are generally well-formed with proper syntax and data types
- **Minor issues identified:**
  - Line 89 contains "ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting manager" which appears to be a formatting artifact
  - Some inconsistencies in comment formatting across statements
- CREATE and ALTER statements follow proper SQL syntax with appropriate data type specifications

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Raw_Lakehouse | Data_Warehouse | Overall |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 90 |
| Correctness | 95 | 92 | 94 |
| **Overall** | **90** | **91** | **90** |

## Recommendations

**For Raw_Lakehouse Agent:**
- Strong analytical approach with clear model selection criteria
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and verify all table relationships  
- Consider adding foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Continue leveraging the flexibility advantage of the Raw_Lakehouse approach

**For Data_Warehouse Agent:**
- Comprehensive consolidation strategy with good standardization approach
- **Critical:** Address formatting artifacts (line 89: "ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrting manager")
- Ensure consistent comment formatting across all DDL statements
- Validate manager_id relationships in employee tables
- The stg_* prefix standardization is a strong architectural choice

**Overall:** Both agents demonstrate high competency in data model analysis and consolidation planning. The choice between approaches should be based on organizational priorities: Raw_Lakehouse for flexibility and scalability, or Data_Warehouse for standardization and analytical optimization.
