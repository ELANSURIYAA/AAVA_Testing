Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-47 (AVAA), Lines 1-89 (AVA+)","AVAA reports inability to complete SAS-to-PySpark conversion review due to missing original SAS code file (TAMBR_RINGS.txt). AVA+ provides comprehensive analysis of conversion accuracy, completeness, and optimization recommendations. Fundamental divergence in execution approach and deliverable completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 4-6 (AVAA), Lines 8-45 (AVA+)","Both agents understand the core task is SAS-to-PySpark conversion review, but AVAA terminates execution due to missing files while AVA+ proceeds with comprehensive analysis. AVAA focuses on procedural blockers, AVA+ delivers substantive technical evaluation. Semantic intent alignment is minimal due to execution divergence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,40,"Lines 7-35 (AVAA), Lines 8-75 (AVA+)","Both follow structured review format with numbered sections. AVAA uses 7 sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, API Cost). AVA+ uses 4 main sections (Conversion Accuracy with 6 subsections, Overall Assessment, Recommendations with 8 points, API Cost). Structural overlap exists but content depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVAA,95,"Lines 7-35","Syntactically correct markdown format. Internal consistency maintained. Clear section headers and bullet points. Logical flow from problem identification to recommendation. Minor issue: API cost format inconsistent with standard currency notation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVA+,98,"Lines 8-85","Excellent markdown syntax and structure. Comprehensive subsection organization. Consistent formatting throughout. Proper use of code references and technical terminology. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point indentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,AVAA,,"Lines 32-34","Should implement file validation checks before starting review process. Consider providing alternative analysis approaches when source files are unavailable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AVA+,,"Lines 63-81","Excellent comprehensive recommendations covering parameterization, performance optimization, error handling, testing, and documentation. Should consider adding file availability validation as prerequisite step."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","AVAA should enhance preprocessing validation. AVA+ should add input validation safeguards. Both agents should implement consistent API cost reporting format."
