Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Ascendion_AVAA), Lines 1-150 (Ascendion_AVA+)","Two fundamentally different approaches to the same task: Ascendion_AVAA reports inability to complete review due to missing SAS code, while Ascendion_AVA+ provides comprehensive detailed review assuming SAS code availability. Semantic similarity is low due to opposite conclusions, structural similarity is moderate due to shared report format, correctness is high for both as properly formatted documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 8-12 (Ascendion_AVAA), Lines 15-45 (Ascendion_AVA+)","Fundamentally different semantic intent and conclusions. Ascendion_AVAA focuses on inability to perform review due to missing input files, explicitly stating 'review cannot be completed' and 'not applicable' for most sections. Ascendion_AVA+ assumes SAS code availability and provides detailed conversion analysis including functionality mapping, data types, control flow, and comprehensive assessment. The outputs address opposite scenarios of the same task."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,68,"Lines 5-35 (Ascendion_AVAA), Lines 10-120 (Ascendion_AVA+)","Both follow similar report structure with numbered sections (1-7 for Ascendion_AVAA, 1-4 for Ascendion_AVA+), author/date headers, and systematic organization. Both include Summary, Assessment, and Recommendations sections. However, Ascendion_AVA+ has more detailed subsections (a,b,c breakdowns) and comprehensive analysis structure, while Ascendion_AVAA has simpler linear structure with brief explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVAA,98,"Lines 1-40","Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, appropriate use of headers and bullet points. Minor deduction for incomplete date field in header (Line 3). All sections are logically consistent and well-formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+,97,"Lines 1-140","Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, detailed subsections, and consistent structure. Minor deduction for incomplete date field in header (Line 3) and some formatting inconsistencies in bullet point indentation (Lines 20-25). Content is comprehensive and well-organized."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 97) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with only minor formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVAA,,"Lines 32-35","Ensure input file availability verification before task execution. Implement file existence checks and clear error messaging when required inputs are missing. Consider fallback strategies or alternative approaches when primary inputs are unavailable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+,,"Lines 90-120","Excellent comprehensive analysis approach. Maintain detailed documentation standards and systematic review methodology. Consider adding input validation steps to prevent scenarios where assumed inputs may not be available."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Establish clear input requirements and validation protocols before task execution. Both agents should implement preliminary checks for required files/inputs. Consider hybrid approach: validate inputs first (Ascendion_AVAA approach), then proceed with detailed analysis if available (Ascendion_AVA+ approach)."
