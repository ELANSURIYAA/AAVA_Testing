Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50,"Two fundamentally different outputs addressing the same SAS-to-PySpark conversion review task. Ascendion AVAA reports inability to complete review due to missing original SAS code file, while Ascendion AVA+ provides comprehensive detailed analysis assuming access to source code. Outputs represent opposite scenarios - task failure vs. task completion."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-20 vs 1-100,"Outputs address same task domain (SAS-to-PySpark conversion review) but with completely different outcomes and purposes. Ascendion AVAA focuses on missing prerequisites (lines 8-12), while Ascendion AVA+ assumes full access and provides detailed technical analysis (lines 15-80). Minimal semantic overlap beyond task identification."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,Lines 1-50 vs 1-100,"Both follow numbered section structure with similar headers (Summary, Assessment, Recommendations). Ascendion AVAA uses 7 sections (lines 7-35), Ascendion AVA+ uses 4 main sections (lines 15-95). Both include API cost analysis. However, content depth and section purposes differ significantly - AVAA focuses on blockers, AVA+ on technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVAA,95,Lines 1-50,"Syntactically correct markdown structure, proper section numbering, consistent formatting. Minor issue: missing date field in header (line 3). All internal references valid, no broken formatting or syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+,98,Lines 1-100,"Excellent syntax and structure throughout. Proper markdown formatting, consistent section hierarchy, valid bullet points and sub-sections. All technical terminology used correctly. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section (line 95)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown structure and internal consistency. Average of individual scores reflects strong technical writing quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVAA,,Lines 35-40,"Provide clear file location protocols and validation steps before initiating review tasks. Implement prerequisite checking mechanisms to avoid incomplete deliverables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+,,Lines 80-95,"Excellent comprehensive analysis - maintain this level of detail. Consider adding validation steps to confirm source code availability before beginning detailed technical reviews to avoid assumptions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Establish standardized review protocols that include prerequisite validation, consistent output formats, and clear escalation procedures for missing dependencies. Both agents should align on task completion criteria and communication standards."
