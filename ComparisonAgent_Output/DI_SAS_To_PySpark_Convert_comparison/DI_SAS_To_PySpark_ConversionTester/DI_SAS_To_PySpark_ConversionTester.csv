Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300 (AVAA), Lines 1-250 (AVA+)","Both agents produced comprehensive pytest suites for validating SAS to PySpark conversion of TAMBR_RINGS logic. AVAA provided a more extensive suite with 22 test cases covering broader aspects including macro variables, database connections, and business logic. AVA+ delivered a more focused suite with 10 test cases emphasizing core transformation logic and edge cases. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of testing requirements and PySpark validation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 15-45 (AVAA), Lines 15-35 (AVA+)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing SAS to PySpark conversion for TAMBR_RINGS. They share similar understanding of key transformation areas: geodist UDF implementation, percentile calculations, join operations, and edge case handling. AVAA covers additional semantic areas like macro variable mapping and database connections that AVA+ doesn't address. Both correctly identify the need for haversine distance calculations and percentile approximations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 50-300 (AVAA), Lines 40-250 (AVA+)","Both follow pytest structure with fixtures and test functions. AVAA uses a more comprehensive approach with 22 test cases organized by functional areas (TC-MV-001, TC-DB-001, etc.). AVA+ uses a simpler numbering scheme (TC01-TC10) with more focused test coverage. Both implement similar fixture patterns for SparkSession and sample data, though AVA+ provides more detailed schema definitions. The overall test organization differs significantly in scope and granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVAA,92,"Lines 80-120, 150-180","AVAA demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure, valid PySpark operations, and correct fixture definitions. Minor issues include some placeholder tests (lines 290-300) that don't implement actual validation logic. The geodist function implementation is mathematically sound and the test cases properly validate expected behaviors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVA+,95,"Lines 60-100, 140-200","AVA+ shows excellent syntactic correctness with well-structured pytest code, proper type definitions, and comprehensive fixture implementations. The haversine UDF implementation is mathematically accurate and properly handles edge cases like None values. All test functions are fully implemented with actual validation logic."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AVAA,,"Lines 290-300","Complete implementation of placeholder tests (TC-PT-001, TC-IT-001) with actual performance benchmarking and end-to-end validation logic. Consider adding more detailed schema validation and error handling test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AVA+,,"Lines 200-250","Expand test coverage to include macro variable mapping, database connection testing, and additional business logic validation that AVAA covers. Consider adding performance and scalability test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from integration: combine AVAA's comprehensive coverage with AVA+'s detailed implementation quality. Standardize test naming conventions and add comprehensive documentation for test execution procedures."
