Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pytest test suites for validating SAS to PySpark conversion of TAMBR_RINGS. Ascendion AVAA offers a broader test coverage with 22 test cases covering macro variables, database connections, and business logic validation. Ascendion AVA+ provides a more focused approach with 10 test cases emphasizing core transformation logic and edge cases. Both include proper pytest fixtures, UDF implementations, and structured test documentation. Key differences lie in test organization, coverage scope, and implementation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-200 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core objective of validating SAS to PySpark conversion through comprehensive pytest suites. They share similar understanding of transformation requirements including geodist UDF implementation, percentile calculations, join operations, and edge case handling. Ascendion AVAA takes a broader approach covering macro variables (TC-MV-001, TC-MV-002) and database connections (TC-DB-001, TC-DB-002) while Ascendion AVA+ focuses more on core transformation logic. Both correctly identify key validation points like null handling, duplicate processing, and performance testing. The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor differences in emphasis and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 50-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with syntactical changes documentation, manual intervention notes, test case tables, and pytest implementations. However, structural differences emerge in organization: Ascendion AVAA uses a more granular test case breakdown (22 cases vs 10) with detailed ID-based categorization (TC-MV-001, TC-DB-001, etc.) while Ascendion AVA+ uses simpler TC01-TC10 numbering. Ascendion AVAA includes a more comprehensive test case table with detailed preconditions and expected results, while Ascendion AVA+ provides more detailed fixture implementations. Both use proper pytest structure with fixtures and assertions, but fixture organization differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVAA,92,"Lines 100-200","Ascendion AVAA demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure, valid Python syntax, and comprehensive test implementations. The geodist function implementation is mathematically sound using proper geodesic calculations. All test functions follow pytest conventions with appropriate assertions. Minor issues include some placeholder tests (test_performance_placeholder, test_end_to_end_placeholder) that lack actual implementation. The test case table structure is well-formed and comprehensive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+,88,"Lines 80-180","Ascendion AVA+ shows good syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure and valid Python implementations. The haversine UDF implementation is mathematically correct and handles null values appropriately. Test fixtures are well-structured with proper schema definitions. However, there are some issues: Line 150 has a potential type casting issue in test_type_mismatch_latlong that may not properly test the intended scenario. The Window import is missing in the deduplication test (Line 120). Overall structure is sound but has minor syntactic gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong syntactic foundation with minor implementation gaps in specific test scenarios."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVAA,,"Implement the placeholder tests (test_performance_placeholder, test_end_to_end_placeholder) with actual timing and pipeline validation logic. Consider adding more specific edge case tests for geodist function with boundary values. Enhance error handling tests with specific exception types rather than generic assertions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+,,"Add missing Window import for deduplication test functionality. Fix the type mismatch test to properly validate type conversion scenarios. Consider expanding test coverage to include macro variable validation and database connection testing similar to Ascendion AVAA's approach. Add more comprehensive fixture data for edge cases."
