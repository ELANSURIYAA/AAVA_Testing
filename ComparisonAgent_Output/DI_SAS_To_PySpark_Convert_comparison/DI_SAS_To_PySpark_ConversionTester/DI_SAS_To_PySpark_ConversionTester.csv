Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive Pytest test suites for validating SAS to PySpark conversion of TAMBR_RINGS. ELANSURIYAA_AAVA provides broader coverage with 22 test cases across all conversion aspects, while Ascendion_AVA+ focuses on 10 core scenarios with more detailed edge case handling. Both follow pytest conventions and include proper fixtures, but differ significantly in scope and implementation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core goal of testing SAS to PySpark conversion validation. They share common themes: geodist UDF testing, data filtering, join operations, percentile calculations, and error handling. However, ELANSURIYAA_AAVA covers broader scope including macro variables (lines 25-26), database connections (lines 27-28), and performance testing (lines 43-44), while Ascendion_AVA+ focuses more deeply on specific edge cases like NULL handling (lines 102-110) and type mismatches (lines 156-162). The semantic intent overlaps significantly but with different emphasis areas."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both follow pytest structure with fixtures and test functions, but organization differs substantially. ELANSURIYAA_AAVA uses a more granular approach with separate test functions for each conversion aspect (lines 25-50), while Ascendion_AVA+ groups related scenarios and uses more comprehensive fixtures (lines 45-85). ELANSURIYAA_AAVA includes a tabular test case document (lines 15-24) that Ascendion_AVA+ lacks. Both use similar fixture patterns (@pytest.fixture) but Ascendion_AVA+ has more sophisticated schema definitions (lines 45-60) and utility functions (lines 40-44)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ELANSURIYAA_AAVA,85,"Lines 31, 38, 47","Generally well-formed pytest code with proper imports and fixture usage. Minor issues: Line 31 uses undefined 'Window' import, Line 38 has potential assertion logic that could be more robust, Line 47 uses placeholder tests that lack implementation. The geodist function implementation (lines 12-18) is mathematically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+,92,"Lines 156-162","Highly structured and syntactically correct pytest implementation. Comprehensive schema definitions, proper UDF implementation, and robust error handling. Minor issue at lines 156-162 where type mismatch test may not properly simulate the intended error condition due to Spark's type coercion behavior."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong pytest implementation skills with proper syntax and structure. Ascendion_AVA+ shows slightly better technical execution with more comprehensive fixtures and error handling, while ELANSURIYAA_AAVA provides broader conceptual coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,ELANSURIYAA_AAVA,N/A,"Lines 43-50","Implement the placeholder tests (performance, integration) with actual logic. Add proper Window import for line 31. Enhance assertion robustness in geodist and percentile tests. Consider adding more detailed schema validation similar to Ascendion_AVA+ approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+,N/A,"Lines 156-162, 45-85","Expand test coverage to include macro variable validation, database connection testing, and performance benchmarking as shown in ELANSURIYAA_AAVA. Consider adding tabular test case documentation for better traceability. Review type mismatch test implementation to ensure proper error simulation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both teams should consider merging approaches: combine ELANSURIYAA_AAVA's comprehensive scope with Ascendion_AVA+'s technical rigor. Standardize on fixture patterns and add integration tests that validate end-to-end pipeline execution. Include performance benchmarking and add more sophisticated error simulation scenarios."
