Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both AVAA and AVA+ outputs deliver comprehensive Pytest suites for validating PySpark TAMBR_RINGS transformation logic. AVAA provides a more concise approach with 10 test cases covering core functionality, while AVA+ offers enhanced detail with more sophisticated fixtures and error handling. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of PySpark testing patterns and edge case coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing PySpark data transformation logic for TAMBR_RINGS monthly process. They cover identical functional areas: geodist/haversine UDF validation, join operations, aggregations, NULL handling, and edge cases. Minor semantic differences include AVAA using 'geodist' terminology while AVA+ uses 'haversine', and slightly different test case naming conventions. Both demonstrate equivalent understanding of the testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,,"Both outputs follow similar pytest structure with fixtures, test functions, and helper utilities. AVAA uses a more straightforward approach with basic fixtures (lines 18-32), while AVA+ employs more sophisticated fixture design with detailed schema definitions (lines 35-85). Both organize tests logically but AVA+ provides more granular test separation and better fixture reusability. Control flow and test organization patterns are largely aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVAA,92,"Lines 25-27, 45-47, 89-91","AVAA output demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with valid pytest structure, proper imports, and well-formed test functions. Minor issues include simplified schema definitions that may not match production schemas exactly, and basic error handling in geodist UDF test (line 89). All Python syntax is valid and PySpark operations are correctly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AVA+,95,"Lines 35-85, 120-125, 180-185","AVA+ output shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive schema definitions, proper type annotations, and robust error handling. More detailed fixture setup (lines 35-85) ensures better test isolation. Minor complexity in some test assertions could be simplified, but all syntax is valid and PySpark operations are properly structured with appropriate exception handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid pytest and PySpark code. AVA+ edges ahead with more comprehensive schema definitions and better error handling patterns, while AVAA provides cleaner, more readable test implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AVAA,,"Consider adopting more detailed schema definitions similar to AVA+ approach for better test reliability. Enhance error handling in UDF tests and add more comprehensive fixture setup for better test isolation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AVA+,,"Simplify some complex test assertions for better readability. Consider consolidating similar test patterns to reduce code duplication while maintaining comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for PySpark testing. Consider standardizing on consistent terminology (geodist vs haversine) and combining the concise approach of AVAA with the detailed fixtures of AVA+ for optimal test suite design."
