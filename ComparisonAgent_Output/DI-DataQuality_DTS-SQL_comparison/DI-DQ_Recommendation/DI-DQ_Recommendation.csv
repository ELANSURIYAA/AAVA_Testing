Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Two JSON arrays containing data quality rules for member data validation. Agent_1 provides 15 rules while Agent_2 provides 23 rules with more granular validation coverage. Both outputs are syntactically valid JSON with similar semantic intent but different structural approaches to rule definition."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both outputs target member data validation with overlapping rule intentions. Core validation concepts align (NotNull, Format, Length checks) but Agent_2 provides more comprehensive coverage with additional StringLengthCheck rules and refined rule types like DomainCheck vs ValueCheck for CITY validation. Agent_1 uses MinimumRequirementCheck while Agent_2 uses ContactInfoPresenceCheck for the same business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both use identical JSON array structure with consistent object schema (Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, Severity). However, Agent_2 demonstrates more granular decomposition with separate rules per validation aspect (e.g., separate NotNull and StringLength rules for FIRSTNAME/LASTNAME), while Agent_1 combines some validations. Agent_2 includes additional rules like RangeCheck for MEMBER_ID not present in Agent_1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,"Lines 1-15","Valid JSON syntax with proper array structure, consistent object schema, correct string escaping, and well-formed key-value pairs throughout all 15 rule definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-23","Valid JSON syntax with proper array structure, consistent object schema, correct string escaping, and well-formed key-value pairs throughout all 23 rule definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON formatting and consistent internal structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 3,6,11","Consider adding StringLengthCheck rules for FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME to match comprehensive validation patterns. Add format validation for phone numbers and enhance COUNTRY field with NotNull constraint."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 10,22","Consider consolidating related rules (e.g., COUNTRY NotNull + StringLength) for cleaner rule management. Evaluate if RangeCheck for MEMBER_ID aligns with business requirements or should be configurable."
