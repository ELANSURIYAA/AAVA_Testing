Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a configuration or input processing issue where the actual agent outputs were not provided for comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real content to analyze intent, meaning, and purpose alignment between the two agents."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real content to analyze logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual DI agent output. Syntax-level validation requires real code, SQL, or documentation content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DataQuality,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual DataQuality agent output. Syntax-level validation requires real code, SQL, or documentation content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify that agent outputs are properly provided as input to the comparison process. 2. Ensure template variables are correctly replaced with actual content before analysis. 3. Check the input processing pipeline to identify where the agent outputs are being lost or not properly substituted. 4. Once actual outputs are available, re-run the comparison with proper semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation criteria."
