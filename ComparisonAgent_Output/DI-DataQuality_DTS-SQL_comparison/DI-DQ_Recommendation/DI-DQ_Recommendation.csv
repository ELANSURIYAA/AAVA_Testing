Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-76","Both outputs provide comprehensive data quality rule specifications for member data validation in JSON format. Output 1 contains 15 rules while Output 2 contains 23 rules, with Output 2 providing more granular validation coverage including additional string length checks and format validations. Both maintain consistent JSON structure and address the same core business requirements for member data integrity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-76","Both outputs address identical business goals of member data validation with overlapping rule coverage. Output 1 focuses on essential validations while Output 2 provides comprehensive coverage including additional constraints like string length limits and enhanced format checks. Key semantic alignment includes: NotNullCheck rules for critical fields (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, MEMBER_ID), format validation for EMAIL and ZIP, uniqueness checks for MEMBER_ID, and contact information presence requirements. Differences include Output 2's additional StringLengthCheck rules and more detailed format specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-76","Both outputs follow identical JSON array structure with consistent object schema containing Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, and Severity fields. The logical organization and field naming conventions are perfectly aligned. Minor structural differences include Output 2's more granular rule decomposition (separate rules for same column with different rule types) and consistent field ordering throughout all objects."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,100,"Lines 1-38","Output 1 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax with properly formatted arrays, objects, quoted strings, and valid structure. All required fields are present, JSON brackets and braces are properly matched, and there are no syntax errors or malformed elements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,100,"Lines 39-76","Output 2 maintains flawless JSON syntax with correct array and object formatting, proper string quoting, and valid JSON structure throughout. All objects contain required fields with consistent formatting and no syntax violations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs achieve perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON formatting, proper structure, and no syntax errors. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,"Lines 1-38","Consider adding string length validations for text fields to prevent data truncation issues. Add format validation for phone numbers to ensure consistent data entry. Include range checks for MEMBER_ID to validate acceptable value ranges."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,"Lines 39-76","Excellent comprehensive coverage. Consider consolidating related rules for the same column to improve maintainability. Verify that the ADDRESS length limit of 16777216 characters aligns with actual database constraints and business requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-76","Both outputs provide solid foundations for data quality validation. Output 2 offers more comprehensive coverage and should be preferred for production implementation. Consider standardizing rule naming conventions and adding rule priority indicators for conflict resolution during validation execution."
