Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two JSON-formatted data quality rule sets for member data validation. Agent 1 provides 15 focused rules covering core validation requirements. Agent 2 provides 23 comprehensive rules with additional granular checks including string length validations and enhanced format checks. Both outputs are syntactically correct and semantically aligned with the same validation objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All lines,"Both outputs address identical member data validation objectives with highly aligned intent. Agent 2 expands on Agent 1's foundation with additional granular rules (string length checks for FIRSTNAME/LASTNAME, enhanced format validations). Core business rules are consistent - both enforce not-null checks for critical fields, format validations for EMAIL/WEB/ZIP, uniqueness for MEMBER_ID, and contact information presence requirements. Minor semantic differences in rule naming (ValueCheck vs DomainCheck, MinimumRequirementCheck vs ContactInfoPresenceCheck) but identical underlying logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,All lines,"Nearly identical JSON structure with same field schema (Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, Severity). Both use consistent array-of-objects format with proper nesting. Agent 2 maintains structural consistency while adding more rule entries. Minor variations in rule type naming conventions but identical overall architectural approach. Same severity classification system (High/Medium/Low) applied consistently across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,All lines,"Syntactically perfect JSON with proper array structure, valid object formatting, consistent field names, appropriate data types, and no syntax errors. All required fields present for each rule entry."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,All lines,"Syntactically perfect JSON with proper array structure, valid object formatting, consistent field names, appropriate data types, and no syntax errors. All required fields present for each rule entry with expanded rule coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON formatting and complete field coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,Lines 1-15,"Consider expanding rule coverage to match Agent 2's comprehensive approach, particularly adding string length validations for name fields and enhanced format checks for contact information."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,Lines 1-23,"Excellent comprehensive coverage. Consider standardizing rule type naming conventions to align with Agent 1's more concise terminology where appropriate (e.g., ValueCheck vs DomainCheck)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for data quality validation. Agent 2's expanded coverage is preferable for production use, while Agent 1's focused approach may be suitable for initial implementation phases. Consider combining Agent 1's concise rule naming with Agent 2's comprehensive coverage for optimal results."
