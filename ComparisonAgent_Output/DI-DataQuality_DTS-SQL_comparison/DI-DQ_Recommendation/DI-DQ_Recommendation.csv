Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-15 vs 1-23,"Two JSON arrays containing data quality rules for member information validation. Agent 1 provides 15 comprehensive rules while Agent 2 provides 23 more granular rules. Both outputs address the same domain (member data validation) with high semantic alignment but different structural approaches to rule granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-15 vs 1-23,"Both outputs target identical business domain (member data validation) with same core intent. Agent 1 uses consolidated rules while Agent 2 breaks down into more specific validations. Key semantic differences: Agent 1 uses 'ValueCheck' for CITY validation (line 5) while Agent 2 uses 'DomainCheck' (line 9) - same intent, different terminology. Agent 1 has 'MinimumRequirementCheck' (line 15) while Agent 2 uses 'ContactInfoPresenceCheck' (line 23) - identical semantic meaning. Both address same business requirements but with different rule decomposition strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,1-15 vs 1-23,"Both use identical JSON array structure with consistent object schema (Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, Severity). Major structural difference: Agent 1 consolidates rules (15 total) while Agent 2 decomposes into granular validations (23 total). Agent 2 adds multiple StringLengthCheck rules (lines 2,4,5,8,10,11,12,18,20) not present in Agent 1. Agent 2 includes additional FormatCheck rules for phone numbers (lines 14,15). Agent 2 adds RangeCheck for MEMBER_ID (line 22) absent in Agent 1. Same logical flow and organization but different granularity approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,100,,"Valid JSON syntax throughout. All objects contain required fields (Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, Severity). No undefined references or broken structure. Consistent field naming and value formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,100,,"Valid JSON syntax throughout. All 23 objects properly structured with required fields. No syntax errors or malformed entries. Consistent schema adherence across all rule definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON structure and consistent object schemas."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,1-15,"Consider adding granular StringLengthCheck rules for better data validation coverage, particularly for FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields. Add FormatCheck rules for phone number validation to improve data quality."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,1-23,"Consider consolidating related rules where business logic allows to reduce complexity. The granular approach is comprehensive but may benefit from grouping related validations for easier maintenance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for data quality validation. Agent 2's granular approach offers better coverage while Agent 1's consolidated approach offers simplicity. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 1's simplicity with Agent 2's comprehensive coverage for optimal data validation strategy."
