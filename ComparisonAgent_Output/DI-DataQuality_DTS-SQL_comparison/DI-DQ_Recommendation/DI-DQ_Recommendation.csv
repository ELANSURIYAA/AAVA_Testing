Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive data quality rule specifications for member data validation. Agent_1_Output defines 15 rules while Agent_2_Output provides 23 rules with more granular coverage. Both outputs use identical JSON structure and address the same business domain. Key differences include Agent_2_Output providing additional string length checks, format validations, and more detailed rule descriptions. Semantic alignment is high (85/100) as both serve the same purpose with overlapping rule coverage. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with identical JSON schema. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both outputs define data quality rules for the same member data schema with high semantic overlap. Agent_1_Output covers essential validation rules while Agent_2_Output provides more comprehensive coverage. Common rules include NotNullCheck for FIRSTNAME/LASTNAME, StringLengthCheck for COMPANY/ADDRESS, FormatCheck for EMAIL/WEB, UniquenessCheck for MEMBER_ID, and DistinctCheck for phone numbers. Agent_2_Output adds granular string length validations, format checks for phone numbers, and range validation for MEMBER_ID. The core business intent is identical - ensuring data quality for member records. Score reduced due to Agent_2_Output's additional rules creating broader coverage scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both outputs use identical JSON array structure with consistent object schema containing Column, Rule Type, Rule Description, and Severity fields. The logical organization follows the same pattern - rules grouped by column with consistent field naming conventions. Agent_2_Output maintains the same structural approach while adding more rule entries. The only structural difference is the number of array elements (15 vs 23). JSON formatting, indentation, and field ordering are consistent. Minor score reduction due to different array lengths affecting structural symmetry."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,"Lines 1-15","Agent_1_Output is syntactically perfect JSON with valid array structure, properly formatted objects, correct field names, consistent data types, and proper string escaping. All JSON syntax rules are followed correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,"Lines 1-23","Agent_2_Output is syntactically perfect JSON with valid array structure, properly formatted objects, correct field names, consistent data types, and proper string escaping. All JSON syntax rules are followed correctly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON structure, proper formatting, and consistent field schemas. No syntax errors or structural issues identified in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,"Lines 1-15","Agent_1_Output provides a solid foundation of essential data quality rules. Consider adding string length validations for name fields, format checks for phone numbers, and range validation for MEMBER_ID to match industry best practices. The current rule set covers critical validations but could benefit from more granular checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,"Lines 1-23","Agent_2_Output demonstrates comprehensive data quality coverage with excellent granularity. The additional string length checks, format validations, and range constraints provide robust data validation. Consider reviewing the ADDRESS length limit (16777216 characters) as it may be unnecessarily large for practical use cases. Overall approach is thorough and production-ready."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-23","Both outputs serve their intended purpose effectively. For production environments, Agent_2_Output's comprehensive approach is recommended due to its broader validation coverage. Organizations should consider the trade-off between rule complexity and maintenance overhead when choosing between approaches. Both maintain excellent JSON structure and field consistency."
