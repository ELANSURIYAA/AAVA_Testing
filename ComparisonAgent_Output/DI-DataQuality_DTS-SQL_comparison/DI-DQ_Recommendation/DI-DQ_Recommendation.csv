Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - input placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were not resolved with actual agent outputs. Framework established for future comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables detected in input."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 1 output not provided (placeholder {{agent 1_string_true}} found)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness - Agent 2 output not provided (placeholder {{agent 2_string_true}} found)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure input format contains real content for comparison. 3. Verify template variable resolution before running comparison. 4. Re-run analysis once actual outputs are available."
