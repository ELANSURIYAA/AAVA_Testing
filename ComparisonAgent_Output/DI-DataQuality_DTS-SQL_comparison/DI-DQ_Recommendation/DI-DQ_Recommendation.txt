# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison could not be completed due to unresolved template variables in the input.

The analysis detected placeholder variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` instead of actual agent outputs. A framework CSV has been generated and uploaded to GitHub documenting this issue.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Rationale**: Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The input contained template placeholders that were not resolved with real content.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100)  
**Rationale**: Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables detected in place of expected content.

### Correctness
- **Agent 1**: 0/100 - No output provided (placeholder `{{agent 1_string_true}}` found)
- **Agent 2**: 0/100 - No output provided (placeholder `{{agent 2_string_true}}` found)  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Cannot calculate without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent1 | Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace placeholder variables with real agent outputs for comparison
2. **Verify Input Format**: Ensure template variables are properly resolved before running the comparison
3. **Re-run Analysis**: Execute the comparison again once actual outputs are available
4. **Input Validation**: Implement checks to detect unresolved placeholders in future runs

## GitHub Output

✅ **Successfully uploaded** `DI-DQ_Recommendation.csv` to GitHub repository `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing` in folder `ComparisonAgent_Output/DI-DataQuality_DTS-SQL_comparison/DI-DQ_Recommendation/`

The CSV file contains the structured comparison framework and documents the placeholder variable issue for future reference and resolution.
