# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Comparison analysis could not be completed due to missing agent outputs. The input contained template variables `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` that were not replaced with actual content, preventing any meaningful comparison between the DI and DataQuality agents.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real content to analyze intent, meaning, and purpose alignment between the two agents.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100) 
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires real content to analyze logical structure, flow, and decomposition approaches.

### Correctness
- **DI Agent**: N/A - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual output content
- **DataQuality Agent**: N/A - Cannot evaluate correctness without actual output content  
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual evaluations

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | DI | DataQuality | Overall |
|--------|----|-----------| --------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Input Processing**: Ensure that agent outputs are properly provided as input to the comparison process
2. **Template Variable Substitution**: Check that template variables are correctly replaced with actual content before analysis
3. **Pipeline Validation**: Review the input processing pipeline to identify where agent outputs are being lost or not properly substituted
4. **Re-run Analysis**: Once actual outputs are available, re-run the comparison with proper semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation criteria
