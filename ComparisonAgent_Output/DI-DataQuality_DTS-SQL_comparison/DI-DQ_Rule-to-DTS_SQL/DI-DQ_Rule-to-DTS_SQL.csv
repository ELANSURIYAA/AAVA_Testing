Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-15 vs 1-23,"Two JSON arrays containing data quality monitoring rules with significant structural and semantic overlap. Agent_1 provides 15 rules with generic table references, while Agent_2 provides 23 rules with specific table names and additional validation checks. Both outputs are syntactically correct JSON with valid SQL queries."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,1-15 vs 1-23,"Both outputs address the same core goal of data quality monitoring for member data. Agent_1 covers essential validations (null checks, format validation, uniqueness) while Agent_2 extends with additional length checks and range validation. Key semantic alignments: FIRSTNAME/LASTNAME null checks (lines 1-2 vs 1,3), COMPANY length validation (line 3 vs 5), CITY domain validation (line 5 vs 9), ZIP format checks (line 8 vs 13), email format validation (line 11 vs 17), phone number distinctness (line 10 vs 16), and contact info requirements (line 15 vs 23). Semantic gaps: Agent_2 adds comprehensive length validations and MEMBER_ID range checks not present in Agent_1."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,1-15 vs 1-23,"Both outputs follow identical JSON array structure with consistent object schema (Monitor name, Monitor description, SQL). Agent_1 uses 15 objects while Agent_2 uses 23 objects. Structural alignment in core areas: null checks grouped at beginning, format validations in middle sections, uniqueness/business rules at end. Key difference: Agent_2 introduces systematic length validation pattern not present in Agent_1, and includes additional granular checks (e.g., separate first/last name length checks at lines 2,4 vs single approach in Agent_1)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,8,"JSON syntax is valid with proper array structure and object formatting. All SQL queries are syntactically correct. Minor issue: ZIP regex pattern '^[0-9]{5}(-[0-9]{4})?$' at line 8 could be more robust for international postal codes, but is technically valid for US ZIP codes."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,13-14,"JSON syntax is valid with proper array structure and object formatting. All SQL queries are syntactically correct with proper table references. Minor issues: ZIP regex pattern at line 13 '^(\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?|[A-Za-z0-9]{3,10})$' has overly broad international pattern that may accept invalid codes. Phone number regex at lines 14-15 '^\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$' is restrictive to one format only."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid JSON structure and SQL syntax. Average correctness score reflects minor regex pattern limitations in both outputs but overall strong technical implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,3-4-6-7,"Consider adding comprehensive length validation checks for all string fields as demonstrated in Agent_2. Add range validation for MEMBER_ID field. Enhance ZIP code regex to handle international postal codes more robustly."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,14-15-19,"Consider making phone number format validation more flexible to accept multiple common formats (parentheses, spaces, etc.). Refine ZIP code international pattern to be more restrictive and accurate. Consider consolidating some redundant length checks where business rules allow."
