Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The input contains placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}}, {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No meaningful semantic, structural, or correctness comparison can be performed without the actual content from both agents. Please provide the actual agent outputs to enable comprehensive comparison and scoring."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI-DataQuality,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DTS-SQL,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure both agent outputs are complete and properly formatted. 3. Include clear identification of the task or instruction that both agents were responding to. 4. Verify that both outputs are addressing the same problem or requirement."
