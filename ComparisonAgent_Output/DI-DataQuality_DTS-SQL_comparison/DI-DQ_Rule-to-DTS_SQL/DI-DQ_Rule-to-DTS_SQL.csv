Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison - Agent outputs not provided. Input contains template placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI-DataQuality,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DTS-SQL,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template placeholders for meaningful comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"2. Ensure input preprocessing replaces all template variables with real content."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"3. Verify data pipeline delivers complete agent outputs before invoking comparison agent."
