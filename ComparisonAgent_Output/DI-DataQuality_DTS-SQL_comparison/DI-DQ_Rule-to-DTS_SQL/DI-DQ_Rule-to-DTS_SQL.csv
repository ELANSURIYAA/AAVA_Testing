Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent output content. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual agent outputs. Comparison requires actual content from both agents to perform semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables present instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables present instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 1 - no actual output provided, only placeholder {{agent 1_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness for Agent 2 - no actual output provided, only placeholder {{agent 2_string_true}}."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure input preprocessing replaces all template variables with real content. 3. Re-run comparison once actual outputs are available. 4. Verify that both agents received the same input prompt for fair comparison."
