Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All Lines,"Two JSON arrays of data quality monitoring rules were compared. Agent_1 contains 15 monitors with generic table references, while Agent_2 contains 24 monitors with specific table names. Both outputs follow valid JSON structure and implement comprehensive data quality checks for member data validation. Agent_2 provides more granular validation with additional length checks and enhanced format validation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,All Lines,"Both outputs serve the same fundamental purpose of data quality monitoring for member records. Core validation concepts align well including null checks, format validation, uniqueness constraints, and business rules. However, Agent_2 introduces additional semantic layers with length constraints and more sophisticated validation patterns. Key differences: Agent_1 focuses on essential validations while Agent_2 provides comprehensive coverage including length limits and enhanced format checks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs follow identical JSON array structure with consistent object schemas containing 'Monitor name', 'Monitor description', and 'SQL' fields. The logical grouping and flow of validation rules is highly similar. Main structural differences: Agent_2 contains 60% more monitors (24 vs 15) and uses specific table names throughout. The ordering and categorization of validation types follows similar patterns in both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 8 and 12,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with valid JSON structure and well-formed SQL queries. Minor issues: Line 8 ZIP regex pattern '^[0-9]{5}(-[0-9]{4})?$' could be more robust for international formats. Line 12 WEB regex pattern is overly restrictive requiring specific path structure. All other SQL syntax and JSON formatting is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 13-15 and 19-20,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with valid JSON structure. Minor issues: Line 13 ZIP regex '^(\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?|[A-Za-z0-9]{3,10})$' has good international support but range validation could be tighter. Lines 14-15 phone format regex '^\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$' is restrictive to US format only. Line 19 WEB regex '^https?://.+$' is too permissive. All SQL syntax is correct with proper escaping."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic validity with only minor regex pattern optimization opportunities."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 8 and 12,"Enhance ZIP code regex pattern to support international postal codes. Relax WEB URL validation to accept broader range of valid URL formats while maintaining security."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 13-15 and 19,"Consider supporting international phone number formats beyond US-only pattern. Tighten WEB URL validation regex to prevent potential security issues while maintaining usability. Consider adding country-specific ZIP validation rules."
