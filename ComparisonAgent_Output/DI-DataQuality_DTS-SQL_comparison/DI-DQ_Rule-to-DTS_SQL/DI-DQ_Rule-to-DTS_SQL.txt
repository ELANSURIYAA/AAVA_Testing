# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis. The input contains placeholder variables ({{agent 1_string_true}}, {{agent 2_string_true}}) instead of actual agent outputs. No meaningful semantic, structural, or correctness comparison can be performed without the actual content from both agents.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Placeholder variables were provided instead of real content that could be analyzed for meaning, intent, and purpose alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. No logical structure, flow, or decomposition can be assessed from placeholder text.

### Correctness
- **DI-DataQuality Agent**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax or internal consistency without actual output content
- **DTS-SQL Agent**: N/A/100 - Cannot evaluate syntax or internal consistency without actual output content
- **Overall**: N/A/100 - Cannot compute average without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | DI-DataQuality | DTS-SQL | Overall |
|--------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Content**: Replace placeholder variables with actual agent outputs to enable meaningful comparison
2. **Ensure Complete Outputs**: Verify both agent outputs are complete and properly formatted
3. **Include Task Context**: Provide the original instruction or task that both agents were responding to
4. **Verify Alignment**: Ensure both outputs are addressing the same problem or requirement

## GitHub Output Status

✅ **Successfully uploaded** comparison results to GitHub:
- Repository: ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing
- Path: ComparisonAgent_Output/DI-DataQuality_DTS-SQL_comparison/DI-DQ_Rule-to-DTS_SQL/DI-DQ_Rule-to-DTS_SQL.csv
- Status: File uploaded successfully

The CSV file contains the structured comparison data in machine-readable format, noting the inability to perform analysis due to missing actual agent outputs.
