# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents deliver comprehensive Python scripts for Synapse-to-Databricks reconciliation automation. Agent 1 provides a more monolithic approach with embedded SQL and extensive inline documentation, while Agent 2 offers a more modular design with better separation of concerns. Both implement similar core functionality including data extraction, transfer, transformation, and validation with robust error handling and logging.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both agents address identical reconciliation goals with the same core transformations. Agent 1 embeds SQL logic directly (lines 45-85), while Agent 2 uses a more dynamic approach (lines 180-220). Both implement the same CASE statement for income_amount handling and identical JOIN patterns. Minor semantic differences exist in error handling approaches and data transfer mechanisms, but the overall intent and business logic remain highly aligned.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Agent 1 uses a linear script structure with embedded configuration and SQL, following a more traditional procedural approach. Agent 2 employs a more modular function-based architecture with clear separation between extraction, transformation, and validation phases. Both follow similar overall flow: extract → transfer → transform → validate → report. Agent 2 demonstrates better code organization with dedicated utility functions (lines 60-90), while Agent 1 maintains a more straightforward linear progression.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**
- Syntactically correct Python with proper imports, exception handling, and variable definitions
- Minor issue: Variable name `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt` contains forward slash which may cause Python naming issues (line 180)
- All SQL syntax is valid, connection strings properly formatted
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implementation

**Agent 2 (Score: 98/100)**
- Excellent syntax correctness with proper Python conventions
- Clean imports and well-structured exception handling
- All variable names follow Python naming conventions
- SQL syntax is valid and properly parameterized
- No syntax issues detected

**Overall Correctness: 96.5/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Structural Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 96.5 |
| **Overall** | **90.7** | **91.7** | **91.2** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
- Fix variable naming issue with `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt` (line 180) to use underscores instead of forward slashes
- Consider modularizing the monolithic structure for better maintainability
- The extensive inline documentation is excellent and should be preserved

**For Agent 2:**
- Excellent implementation with superior code organization
- Consider adding more inline documentation for complex SQL transformations
- The modular structure is well-designed and production-ready

**Overall:**
Both agents provide enterprise-grade solutions for Synapse-to-Databricks reconciliation. Agent 2 has a slight edge in code organization and syntax correctness. Consider a hybrid approach combining Agent 2's modular structure with Agent 1's detailed documentation for optimal results.
