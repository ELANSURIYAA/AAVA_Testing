Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents deliver comprehensive Python scripts for Synapse-to-Databricks reconciliation automation. Agent 1 provides a more monolithic approach with embedded SQL and extensive inline documentation, while Agent 2 offers a more modular design with better separation of concerns. Both implement similar core functionality including data extraction, transfer, transformation, and validation with robust error handling and logging."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-300 (both agents)","Both agents address identical reconciliation goals with same core transformations. Agent 1 embeds SQL logic directly (lines 45-85), while Agent 2 uses more dynamic approach (lines 180-220). Both implement same CASE statement for income_amount handling and identical JOIN patterns. Minor semantic differences in error handling approaches and data transfer mechanisms."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 250-300","Agent 1 uses linear script structure with embedded configuration and SQL. Agent 2 employs more modular function-based architecture with clear separation between extraction, transformation, and validation phases. Both follow similar overall flow: extract → transfer → transform → validate → report. Agent 2 has better code organization with utility functions (lines 60-90)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 20-25, 180-185","Syntactically correct Python with proper imports, exception handling, and variable definitions. Minor issue: ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt variable name contains forward slash which may cause issues (line 180). All SQL syntax is valid, connection strings properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-300","Excellent syntax correctness with proper Python conventions, clean imports, and well-structured exception handling. All variable names follow Python naming conventions. SQL syntax is valid and properly parameterized. No syntax issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both agents demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor naming convention issue in Agent 1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Fix variable naming issue with ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt (line 180) to use underscores instead of forward slashes. Consider modularizing the monolithic structure for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent implementation. Consider adding more inline documentation for complex SQL transformations. The modular structure is well-designed and production-ready."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents provide enterprise-grade solutions. Agent 2 has slight edge in code organization and syntax correctness. Consider hybrid approach: Agent 2's structure with Agent 1's detailed documentation."
