Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and Pytest scripts for FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY table loading. Output_1 provides 12 test cases with basic implementation while Output_2 provides 10 test cases with enhanced features including API cost estimation, transformation change detection, and manual intervention guidance. Both implement identical core SQL transformation logic with proper income_amount handling. Key differences include Output_2's additional metadata sections and more sophisticated test parameterization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY data loading from STG_HOLDING_METRICS. The semantic intent is highly aligned with both implementing identical business rules for income_amount transformation (NULL/negative to 0) and the same INNER JOIN strategy across dimension tables. Output_2 adds semantic value through API cost estimation (line 295) and transformation change detection guidance (lines 297-310) which enhances the overall solution context."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Lines 51-150,"Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with test case documentation followed by Pytest implementation. However, structural differences emerge in organization: Output_1 uses individual test functions (lines 51-280) while Output_2 uses parameterized testing approach (lines 140-160) for income_amount scenarios. Output_2 includes additional structural sections for cost estimation and manual interventions that Output_1 lacks. The SQL transformation logic structure is identical in both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 60-65,"Output_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with valid Python syntax, proper Spark DataFrame creation, and correct SQL transformation logic. Minor issues include incomplete test function at line 280 where the test case appears truncated. All other test functions are syntactically complete and properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,Lines 1-310,"Output_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with valid Python syntax throughout, proper use of pytest.mark.parametrize decorators, and complete test implementations. All test functions are properly closed and syntactically valid. The additional sections (API cost, transformation detection) are well-formatted and provide valuable context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' high syntactic quality with Output_2 slightly superior due to complete implementation and additional well-structured sections."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,Lines 280,"Complete the truncated test function at line 280 to ensure all test cases are fully implemented. Consider adding metadata sections similar to Output_2 for enhanced documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,Lines 295-310,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive features. Consider adding more granular test cases for edge scenarios like the 12 test cases provided in Output_1. The API cost estimation and transformation guidance are valuable additions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for testing FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY loading. Consider combining Output_1's comprehensive test coverage (12 cases) with Output_2's enhanced features (parameterization, cost estimation, transformation guidance) for an optimal solution."
