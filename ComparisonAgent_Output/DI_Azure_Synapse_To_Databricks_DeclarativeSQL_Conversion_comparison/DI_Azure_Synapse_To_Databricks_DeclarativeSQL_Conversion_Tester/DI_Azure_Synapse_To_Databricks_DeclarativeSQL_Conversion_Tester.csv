Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300+","Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY loading with similar business logic but different implementation approaches. Agent 1 has 12 test cases but incomplete code, while Agent 2 has 10 complete test cases with additional documentation sections."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY loading from STG_HOLDING_METRICS. They share identical business rules for income_amount handling (NULL/negative to 0), similar test scenarios for edge cases, and equivalent SQL transformation logic. Minor differences in test case coverage (12 vs 10) and additional documentation sections in Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 51-200, 250-300","Both follow similar pytest structure with fixture setup, helper functions, and parameterized tests. Agent 1 uses simpler DataFrame creation with tuples, while Agent 2 uses Row objects and more sophisticated test organization. Agent 2 includes additional sections (API cost, transformation mapping) not present in Agent 1. Core SQL logic structure is nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,60,"Lines 280-300","Code is incomplete - cuts off mid-function in TC07 test case. Missing closing brackets, incomplete test implementations for TC08-TC12. Syntax errors would prevent execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-400","Complete, syntactically correct Python code. All test cases properly implemented with correct pytest syntax, proper DataFrame creation, and complete function definitions. Minor deduction for potential pandas import without explicit error handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,"Lines 280-300","Complete the truncated code sections, particularly TC07-TC12 test cases. Add proper error handling and ensure all test functions are syntactically complete."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,"Lines 350-400","Consider adding the missing test cases from Agent 1 (TC11-TC12) for comprehensive coverage. Add explicit error handling for pandas DataFrame creation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"Lines 1-400","Standardize DataFrame creation approach across test cases. Consider adding performance benchmarks for large dataset tests. Implement consistent teardown procedures to prevent test interference."
