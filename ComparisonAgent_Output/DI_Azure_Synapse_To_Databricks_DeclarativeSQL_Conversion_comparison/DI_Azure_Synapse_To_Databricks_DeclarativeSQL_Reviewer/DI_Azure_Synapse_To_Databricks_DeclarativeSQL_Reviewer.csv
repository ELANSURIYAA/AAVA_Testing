Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Synapse to Databricks conversion for LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY procedure. AAVA focuses on transformation areas and business logic preservation while AAVA_Reviewer emphasizes testing frameworks and validation scripts. Both maintain consistent technical accuracy and cover similar scope."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Synapse to Databricks conversion. AAVA emphasizes procedural construct elimination and audit logging changes (lines 15-25) while AAVA_Reviewer focuses on test coverage and reconciliation scripts (lines 20-35). Same intent with different emphasis on validation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-50,"Both follow similar section structure: Summary -> Conversion Accuracy -> Optimization Suggestions -> API Cost. AAVA uses more detailed subsections within each area while AAVA_Reviewer uses bullet points and concise formatting. Different organizational approaches but same logical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,95,Lines 1-50,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper section headers and consistent formatting. All technical references are accurate including table names STG_HOLDING_METRICS and FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY. Minor inconsistency in scoring format (7/10 vs 9/10 without clear scale definition)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Reviewer,98,Lines 1-50,"Excellent syntax and structure with clear metadata section and consistent bullet formatting. All technical details are accurate and well-referenced. Proper use of code formatting for table names and SQL constructs. Clear API cost format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"High overall correctness with both outputs maintaining technical accuracy and proper documentation structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,,Lines 25-40,"Consider standardizing scoring methodology with clear scale definitions. Enhance subsection organization for better readability. Add more specific line references for technical details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Reviewer,,Lines 15-30,"Excellent structure and clarity. Consider expanding on optimization details to match depth of technical analysis. Add more granular performance recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency. AAVA_Reviewer shows slight edge in structure and testing focus while AAVA provides more detailed transformation analysis. Consider combining approaches for optimal coverage."
