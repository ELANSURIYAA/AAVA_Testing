Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive reviews of the Synapse to Databricks SQL conversion for LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical core objectives and business logic analysis. Structural similarity is excellent (95/100) with nearly identical section organization and flow. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and internal consistency. Key differences include Agent_2 providing more detailed testing frameworks (Pytest) and reconciliation scripts, while Agent_1 focuses more on procedural construct elimination details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the identical conversion task with same business objectives. Agent_1 emphasizes procedural construct elimination (lines 15-25) while Agent_2 focuses on testing and validation frameworks (lines 20-30). Core business logic analysis is identical including income_amount validation, dimension table joins, and data quality measures. Minor divergence in emphasis on optimization approaches - Agent_1 focuses on medallion architecture (lines 40-45) while Agent_2 emphasizes Delta table optimization (lines 35-40)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-50,"Nearly identical structural organization with same four main sections: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Optimization Suggestions, API Cost Estimation. Both follow logical progression from overview to detailed analysis to recommendations. Agent_2 includes additional subsections for testing frameworks and reconciliation scripts (lines 25-35) not present in Agent_1. Section headers and content flow are otherwise identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,Lines 1-50,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and coherent content structure. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,Lines 1-50,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and coherent content structure. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Agent_1 provides comprehensive optimization recommendations including medallion architecture evaluation, streaming vs batch processing assessment, and automated data lineage tracking. Strong focus on long-term architectural considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 35-45,"Agent_2 provides detailed testing and validation frameworks including Pytest unit tests and reconciliation scripts. Strong focus on immediate implementation and validation capabilities. Recommends Delta table optimization and caching strategies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 35-50,"Both outputs provide valuable but complementary recommendations. Agent_1 excels in strategic architectural guidance while Agent_2 provides tactical implementation frameworks. Combined approach would be optimal for comprehensive conversion project success."
