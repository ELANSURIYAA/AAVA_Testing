Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as no actual agent outputs were provided. Input contained only template placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} without replacement values. To complete this analysis, please provide the actual outputs from both agents that need to be compared."
