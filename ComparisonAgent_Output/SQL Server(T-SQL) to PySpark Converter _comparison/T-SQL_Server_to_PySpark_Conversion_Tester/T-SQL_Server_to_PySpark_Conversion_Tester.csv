Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comprehensive comparison of two test case implementations for uspAPIPatchAccount PySpark functionality. Agent 1 provides detailed test documentation with 10 test cases and comprehensive pytest implementation with fixtures and mock data. Agent 2 offers broader coverage with 15 test cases in tabular format and complete pytest implementation with pipeline simulation. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with different organizational approaches and coverage strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing uspAPIPatchAccount PySpark implementation. Agent 1 focuses on comprehensive fixture setup and detailed test scenarios (lines 1-500+), while Agent 2 emphasizes broader test coverage with systematic boundary testing (lines 1-400+). Both include essential test categories: basic filtering, national accounts, email validation, and error handling. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive edge case coverage including performance testing and special character handling, while Agent 1 offers more detailed implementation with sophisticated mock data structures."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case documentation followed by pytest implementation. Agent 1 uses descriptive test case format with detailed descriptions (lines 1-50), while Agent 2 uses tabular format for test cases (lines 1-30). Both implement pytest fixtures for Spark session, schemas, and sample data. Agent 1 provides more detailed schema definitions and comprehensive fixture setup (lines 60-200), while Agent 2 uses simplified approach with focused pipeline simulation (lines 50-150). Structural differences include Agent 1's more granular fixture organization versus Agent 2's integrated pipeline approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,92,Lines 85-90,"Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure, comprehensive schema definitions, and valid PySpark syntax. Minor issues include potential import path assumptions (line 85: 'from uspAPIPatchAccount_pyspark import process_api_patch_account') and some fixture dependencies that may need adjustment. Overall implementation is well-structured with proper error handling and comprehensive test data setup."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,Lines 45-50,"Agent 2 shows good syntactic correctness with valid pytest structure and PySpark implementation. Some concerns include simplified UDF implementation (lines 45-50) that may not fully replicate production logic, and potential issues with the build_json_message function complexity. The pipeline implementation is generally sound but includes some assumptions about data structures that may need validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python, pytest, and PySpark syntax. Average correctness score reflects strong technical implementation with minor areas for improvement in import assumptions and function complexity management."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 85-90,"Verify import paths and module structure assumptions. Consider adding more boundary test cases to match Agent 2's comprehensive coverage. Enhance performance testing scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Refine the build_json_message UDF implementation for production accuracy. Add more detailed fixture setup similar to Agent 1's approach. Consider expanding test case documentation with more descriptive formats."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide solid foundations for testing uspAPIPatchAccount functionality. Consider combining Agent 1's detailed fixture approach with Agent 2's comprehensive test coverage. Standardize on consistent test case documentation format and ensure all edge cases are covered with proper assertions."
