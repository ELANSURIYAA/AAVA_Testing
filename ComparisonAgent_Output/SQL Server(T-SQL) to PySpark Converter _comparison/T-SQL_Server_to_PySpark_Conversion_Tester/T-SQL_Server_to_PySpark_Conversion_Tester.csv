Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300+ (Agent 1), Lines 1-200+ (Agent 2)","Both agents produced comprehensive test case documents for uspAPIPatchAccount PySpark implementation. Agent 1 provides more detailed documentation with extensive fixtures and schemas, while Agent 2 uses a more concise tabular approach. Both cover similar test scenarios but with different implementation styles and levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15 (test case descriptions), Lines 50-300 (pytest implementations)","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing uspAPIPatchAccount PySpark function. They cover similar test scenarios including basic filtering, national accounts, email validation, loop instance handling, and edge cases. However, Agent 1 provides more detailed descriptions and comprehensive fixture setup, while Agent 2 uses a more streamlined approach with tabular test case documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (documentation structure), Lines 51-300 (code organization)","Agent 1 follows a traditional documentation approach with numbered test cases (TC-01 to TC-15) followed by extensive pytest implementation with detailed fixtures and schemas. Agent 2 uses a hybrid approach with a tabular test case summary followed by pytest code. Both maintain logical flow but with different organizational patterns - Agent 1 is more verbose and detailed, Agent 2 is more concise and table-driven."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 51-300 (pytest implementation)","Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper pytest fixtures, comprehensive schema definitions, proper PySpark DataFrame creation, and well-structured test functions. All imports are correctly specified, fixture dependencies are properly managed, and test assertions are syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,90,"Lines 50-200 (pytest implementation)","Agent 2 shows good syntax correctness with valid pytest structure and PySpark operations. However, there are some minor issues: the build_json_message function implementation is simplified and may not handle all edge cases properly, and some test assertions could be more robust. The overall structure is sound but less comprehensive than Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents, reflecting generally high syntactic quality with Agent 1 being slightly more comprehensive and robust in implementation details."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 51-300","Agent 1 excels in comprehensive documentation and detailed fixture setup. Strengths include extensive schema definitions, proper error handling, and thorough test coverage. Consider streamlining some of the verbose documentation while maintaining the technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 1-50, 150-200","Agent 2 provides a more concise and readable approach with effective tabular documentation. Strengths include clear test case organization and streamlined implementation. Consider expanding the build_json_message function implementation and adding more comprehensive error handling to match the robustness of Agent 1."
