# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Analysis could not be completed due to missing input data.

The comparison analysis was unable to proceed because the provided input contains template variables (`{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}`) instead of actual agent outputs. Without the real content from both agents, it's impossible to perform meaningful semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness evaluations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 0/100)
**Issue**: Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The input contains only template variables that have not been populated with real content.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 0/100) 
**Issue**: Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content that could be analyzed for logical structure and flow.

### Correctness
- **T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent1**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation
- **T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent2**: 0/100 - No content available for syntax validation  
- **Overall**: 0/100 - Cannot calculate average without individual scores

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent1 | T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Structural Similarity | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Correctness | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Overall** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Actual Agent Outputs**: Replace the template variables with the real outputs from both agents that need to be compared.

2. **Ensure Task Completion**: Verify that both agents have successfully completed their T-SQL to PySpark conversion tasks and generated outputs before initiating comparison analysis.

3. **Input Format Verification**: Confirm that the input format contains actual content to be analyzed rather than placeholder text or template variables.

4. **Re-run Analysis**: Once proper agent outputs are provided, re-execute this comparison analysis to obtain meaningful semantic, structural, and correctness scores.
