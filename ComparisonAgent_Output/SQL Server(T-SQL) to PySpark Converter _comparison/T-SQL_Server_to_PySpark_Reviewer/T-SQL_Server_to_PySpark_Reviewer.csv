Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive analyses of a SQL Server to PySpark conversion for the uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. Both follow identical structural organization with 5 main sections covering summary, conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and overall assessment. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in addressing the conversion analysis task, with both identifying key technical considerations like JSON generation approaches, error handling, and performance optimizations. Minor differences exist in depth of technical detail and specific optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the identical core task of analyzing a T-SQL to PySpark conversion with strong semantic alignment. Both identify the same key business logic elements (filtering conditions, LoopInstance calculation, JSON message structure, email validation). Agent 1 focuses more on high-level conversion accuracy and optimization strategies, while Agent 2 provides more granular technical details including test case coverage and specific implementation notes. Both reach similar conclusions about conversion accuracy and required optimizations, though Agent 2 provides more comprehensive technical depth with specific code examples and edge case considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1. Summary, 2. Conversion Accuracy, 3. Discrepancies and Issues, 4. Optimization Suggestions, 5. Overall Assessment. The logical flow and section decomposition are virtually identical. Minor structural differences include Agent 2 having slightly more detailed subsections within each main section and including additional technical specifications. Both maintain consistent formatting with numbered sections and bullet points for recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,98,1-50,"Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal structure, and valid technical references. All technical terms and concepts are used correctly. Section numbering is consistent (1-5). No broken references or formatting issues detected. Minor deduction for one instance of incomplete sentence structure in line 23 where 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrts' appears to be a formatting artifact."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,1-60,"Agent 2 output is syntactically perfect with proper formatting, consistent structure, and valid technical content throughout. All section references are correct, technical terminology is accurate, and formatting is consistent. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Agent 1 provides solid high-level analysis but could benefit from: 1) More specific technical implementation details and code examples, 2) Inclusion of test case considerations and edge case handling, 3) More granular analysis of potential runtime differences between T-SQL and PySpark implementations, 4) Addition of performance benchmarking considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Agent 2 provides comprehensive technical analysis but could enhance by: 1) Including more strategic business impact considerations, 2) Adding cost-benefit analysis of optimization recommendations, 3) Providing implementation timeline and resource estimates, 4) Including risk assessment for the conversion approach."
