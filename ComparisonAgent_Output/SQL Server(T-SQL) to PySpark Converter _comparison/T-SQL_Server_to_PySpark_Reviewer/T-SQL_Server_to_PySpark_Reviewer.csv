Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive analyses of a T-SQL stored procedure to PySpark conversion. Agent1 delivers a structured evaluation focusing on practical optimization recommendations and business logic preservation. Agent2 provides more technical depth with detailed test coverage analysis and comprehensive edge case handling. Both maintain the same 5-section structure and address conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization opportunities. The analyses complement each other with Agent1 emphasizing operational improvements and Agent2 focusing on technical completeness and validation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 51-100","Both outputs address the same core objective of evaluating T-SQL to PySpark conversion quality. Agent1 emphasizes practical optimization (broadcast joins, JSON generation efficiency, caching strategies) while Agent2 provides deeper technical analysis including comprehensive test coverage and edge case handling. Both correctly identify key conversion elements like filtering conditions, LoopInstance calculations, and JSON message structure. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent1 focuses on performance optimization, Agent2 on validation completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs follow identical 5-section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment. Section ordering and logical flow are nearly identical. Both use numbered sections and similar subsection organization. Minor differences in content depth and technical detail level, but structural alignment is excellent. Both conclude with overall assessment and maintain consistent analytical progression throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 75-125","Agent1 provides technically sound analysis with accurate PySpark optimization recommendations. Correctly identifies broadcast join opportunities, JSON generation inefficiencies, and caching strategies. Minor issue: some optimization suggestions could be more specific (line 85-90 regarding partition management). Overall technically accurate with practical, implementable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 100-150","Agent2 demonstrates superior technical completeness with comprehensive test coverage analysis and detailed edge case handling. Accurately covers all conversion aspects including null handling, special character escaping, and performance considerations. Includes specific technical details about UDF limitations and native Spark SQL alternatives. Highly accurate and thorough technical analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with Agent2 slightly more comprehensive in technical depth and validation coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 75-125","Strengthen technical depth by adding more specific implementation details for optimization suggestions. Include comprehensive test coverage analysis similar to Agent2's approach. Consider adding more detailed edge case handling discussions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Lines 50-75","Excellent technical analysis. Consider adding more practical implementation guidance and operational considerations as demonstrated in Agent1's optimization section. Balance technical depth with actionable recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs would benefit from combining Agent1's practical optimization focus with Agent2's comprehensive technical validation approach. Consider creating a hybrid analysis that maintains technical rigor while providing clear implementation guidance."
