Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300","Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of T-SQL to PySpark conversion for uspAPIPatchAccount stored procedure. Both follow identical 5-section structure (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment) and reach similar conclusions about conversion quality. Key differences include depth of technical detail, specific optimization recommendations, and cost reporting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 150-200","Both outputs address the same core goal of evaluating T-SQL to PySpark conversion quality. They share identical understanding of the conversion task, similar assessment of business logic preservation, and comparable conclusions about overall success. Minor semantic divergence in emphasis on specific technical aspects (Agent 1 focuses more on JSON generation approaches, Agent 2 emphasizes test coverage and edge cases)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-300","Nearly identical structural organization with same 5-section framework. Both use numbered sections, bullet points for sub-items, and similar logical flow from summary through detailed analysis to recommendations. Only minor differences in subsection organization within Optimization Suggestions section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,uspAPIPatchAccount.txt__v22qdrpp,98,"Lines 25, 180","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and coherent narrative flow. Minor issue: inconsistent spacing in some bullet points and one incomplete sentence fragment at line 180."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Analysis,95,"Lines 45, 220, 280","Generally well-structured with proper formatting and clear organization. Issues include: incomplete bullet point at line 45, minor formatting inconsistency in code blocks at line 220, and missing period at end of sentence at line 280."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, consistent formatting, and clear organization. Minor formatting inconsistencies in both outputs prevent perfect scores."
