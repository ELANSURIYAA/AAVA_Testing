Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis. The provided input contains template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that have not been populated with actual agent outputs. Without the actual content from both agents, semantic similarity, structural similarity, and correctness analysis cannot be performed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of template variables for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure both agents have completed their tasks and generated outputs before initiating comparison analysis. 3. Verify that the input format contains the actual content to be analyzed rather than placeholder text."
