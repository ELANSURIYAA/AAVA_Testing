Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to complete comparison analysis due to missing agent outputs. Input contained template variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that were not replaced with actual content. This appears to be a configuration or preprocessing issue where the actual agent outputs were not properly substituted into the template."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs to compare. Template variables were provided instead of real content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Converter_Agent,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate correctness without actual agent output content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Verify that the agent output preprocessing pipeline is correctly substituting actual content for template variables. 2. Ensure that both agent outputs are properly captured and formatted before passing to the comparison system. 3. Implement input validation to detect template variables and flag incomplete preprocessing. 4. Re-run the comparison once actual agent outputs are available."
