Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder variables to enable meaningful comparison and evaluation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Ensure input format contains complete agent outputs with proper content for T-SQL to PySpark conversion analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Verify that agent outputs include actual code, documentation, or analysis content rather than template variables."
