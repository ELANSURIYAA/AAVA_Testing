Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as actual agent outputs were not provided. Input contained placeholder text '{{agent 1_string_true}}' and '{{agent 2_string_true}}' instead of real content. This appears to be a template or configuration issue where the actual agent outputs need to be substituted before analysis can proceed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Expected T-SQL to PySpark conversion code but received placeholder text instead."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically analyze SQL query structure vs PySpark DataFrame operations structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_Agent,0,N/A,"No actual output provided for syntax validation. Expected T-SQL or PySpark code for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_Converter_Agent,0,N/A,"No actual output provided for syntax validation. Expected T-SQL or PySpark code for analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholder text for meaningful comparison. 2. Ensure T-SQL and PySpark code samples are complete and syntactically valid. 3. Include sample input data and expected output for comprehensive evaluation. 4. Verify that conversion logic preserves data integrity and business logic. 5. Test with complex SQL constructs like CTEs, window functions, and joins."
