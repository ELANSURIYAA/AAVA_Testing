Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The input contained placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} but no actual content to analyze. This appears to be a template or configuration issue where the actual agent outputs need to be substituted before analysis can proceed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires analyzing the meaning, intent, and purpose alignment between two agent responses."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. The comparison requires analyzing logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,T-SQL_Server_to_PySpark_Unit_Tester_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax-level correctness without actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot compute overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To perform proper agent output comparison: 1) Provide actual agent outputs instead of placeholders, 2) Ensure outputs are properly formatted and complete, 3) Verify that both agents attempted the same task with comparable scope, 4) Re-run the comparison analysis with actual content."
