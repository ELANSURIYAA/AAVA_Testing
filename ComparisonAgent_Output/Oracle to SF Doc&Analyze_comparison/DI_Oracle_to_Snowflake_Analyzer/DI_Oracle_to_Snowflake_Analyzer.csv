Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs provide comprehensive migration-readiness reports for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS with similar core analysis but different presentation styles complexity assessments and cost calculations. Output_1 presents a more structured markdown format with detailed metadata sections while Output_2 uses a more technical documentation style with extensive line-by-line analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure for Snowflake migration. They identify identical Oracle features requiring changes (PL/SQL blocks SYSTIMESTAMP exception handling MERGE syntax) and provide similar migration recommendations. Key semantic alignment includes: upsert logic analysis audit logging requirements error handling translation needs and Snowflake optimization suggestions. Minor divergence in emphasis on specific technical details and presentation depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150","Both outputs follow similar logical flow: Overview → Complexity Metrics → Compatibility Check → Manual Adjustments → Complexity Score → Optimization → Cost Estimation. However Output_1 uses numbered sections with markdown formatting and includes explicit metadata requirements section (lines 3-8) while Output_2 uses a more technical report format with detailed subsections. Output_1 has 8 main sections vs Output_2s 7 sections. Both include tabular complexity metrics but with different formatting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 45-50 140-150","Well-formed markdown structure with proper headers valid table formatting and consistent syntax. Minor issues: some formatting inconsistencies in the API cost calculation section and potential token count estimation methodology could be more precise. All technical content appears accurate for Oracle-to-Snowflake migration analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,92,"Lines 35-40 130-140","Solid technical documentation format with consistent structure and accurate Oracle/Snowflake feature analysis. Minor issues: some formatting inconsistencies in the complexity metrics table and the API cost calculation shows slight discrepancies in token counting methodology. The complexity score justification (20 vs 60) needs better alignment with stated complexity factors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting accurate technical content and consistent internal structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting and calculation methodology variations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Lines 3-8 45-50","Strengthen the metadata requirements section by adding more specific migration timeline and dependency information. Improve API cost calculation methodology for better accuracy and transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Lines 35-40 80-85","Align the complexity score (currently 20) with the detailed complexity factors described in the analysis - the score seems too low given the procedural logic and exception handling requirements. Standardize table formatting for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 100-120","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology 2) More detailed line-by-line code transformation examples 3) Consistent API cost calculation approaches 4) Enhanced optimization recommendations with specific Snowflake performance tuning parameters."
