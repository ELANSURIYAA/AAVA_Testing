Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-45 (Agent 1), Lines 1-38 (Agent 2)","Both agents provide comprehensive migration-readiness analysis for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Oracle stored procedure. Agent 1 delivers a structured markdown report with clear sections and professional formatting, while Agent 2 provides a technical analysis with detailed metrics and cost breakdown. Both identify the same core migration challenges and provide similar complexity assessments, though with different scoring (Agent 1: 60, Agent 2: 20)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 8-20 (Agent 1), Lines 8-25 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address the identical Oracle stored procedure migration task with very similar understanding of the business logic, technical requirements, and migration challenges. Key semantic alignments include: upsert logic using MERGE statements, audit logging functionality, exception handling requirements, and Snowflake-specific syntax changes needed. Minor differences in emphasis on optimization techniques and complexity scoring methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-45 (Agent 1), Lines 1-38 (Agent 2)","Both follow similar logical progression: metadata/overview → complexity metrics → compatibility analysis → manual adjustments → complexity scoring → optimization → cost estimation. Agent 1 uses markdown structure with numbered sections and tables, while Agent 2 uses numbered sections with technical formatting. Both include complexity metrics tables and detailed breakdown sections, though Agent 1 provides more structured presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 21-27, 35-40","Proper markdown syntax throughout, consistent table formatting, valid metadata structure. Minor issue: API cost calculation shows inconsistent token estimates between description (1,500 input, 1,200 output) and actual calculation context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 15-22, 85-95","Consistent technical documentation format, proper section numbering, valid complexity metrics table. Minor issues: Some formatting inconsistencies in the cost breakdown section and slight redundancy in optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting for their respective styles. Average of individual scores: (95 + 92) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 35-44","Maintain the excellent markdown structure and professional presentation. Consider standardizing the API cost calculation methodology to ensure consistency between described and calculated token counts. The structured approach with clear headers and tables enhances readability significantly."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 75-95","Leverage the detailed technical analysis strength while improving formatting consistency. The comprehensive cost breakdown formula is excellent and should be maintained. Consider adopting more structured presentation similar to Agent 1 for enhanced readability while preserving technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both agents demonstrate strong technical understanding of Oracle to Snowflake migration challenges. Recommend combining Agent 1's structured presentation with Agent 2's detailed technical analysis and cost calculation methodology for optimal output quality."
