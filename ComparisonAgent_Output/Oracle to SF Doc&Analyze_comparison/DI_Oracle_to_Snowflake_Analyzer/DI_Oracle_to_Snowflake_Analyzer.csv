Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive migration-readiness reports for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS. Markdown_Agent delivers a well-structured markdown report with clear sections and formatting while PlainText_Agent provides detailed technical analysis in plain text format. Both cover essential migration aspects including complexity metrics compatibility checks and cost estimation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-45 (Markdown_Agent) Lines 1-38 (PlainText_Agent)","Both agents address identical migration goals and provide similar technical assessments. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both identify MERGE operations and upsert logic as core functionality (2) Both recognize PL/SQL procedural blocks as primary migration challenge (3) Both recommend similar Snowflake adaptations (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP exception handling changes) (4) Both provide complexity scoring (60 vs 20 - significant difference in assessment). Minor semantic divergence in complexity scoring methodology and optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-45 (Markdown_Agent) Lines 1-38 (PlainText_Agent)","Strong structural alignment with both following migration report templates. Markdown_Agent uses 8 numbered sections with markdown formatting while PlainText_Agent uses 7 sections with plain text structure. Both include: (1) Script Overview (2) Complexity Metrics tables (3) Compatibility Check sections (4) Manual Adjustments (5) Conversion Complexity scoring (6) Optimization techniques (7) API Cost estimation. Structural differences: Markdown_Agent includes dedicated Metadata Requirements section PlainText_Agent provides more detailed cost calculation breakdown."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Markdown_Agent,88,"Lines 15-17 35-37 42-45","Generally well-formed markdown with proper section headers and table formatting. Issues identified: (1) Line 15-17: Complexity metrics table shows 45 lines vs actual procedure length discrepancy (2) Line 35-37: SYSTIMESTAMP replacement guidance correct but lacks Snowflake scripting syntax details (3) Line 42-45: API cost calculation methodology sound but token estimates may be imprecise without actual measurement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PlainText_Agent,91,"Lines 12-14 28-30 35-38","Well-structured plain text with consistent formatting and accurate technical details. Minor issues: (1) Line 12-14: Reports 38 lines vs 45 in other agent - needs verification (2) Line 28-30: Exception handling translation details are accurate for Snowflake (3) Line 35-38: Complexity score of 20 seems optimistic given procedural logic requirements. Overall syntax and technical accuracy is high."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores (88 + 91) / 2 = 89.5 rounded to 90. Both agents demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor discrepancies in metrics and assessments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Markdown_Agent,,"Improve technical precision in complexity metrics and line count accuracy. Enhance Snowflake-specific syntax examples in migration guidance sections. Consider adding more detailed cost calculation methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PlainText_Agent,,"Verify and reconcile line count discrepancies with source procedure. Consider adjusting complexity score assessment methodology for better accuracy. Maintain the excellent technical detail level while improving metric consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents provide valuable migration insights with complementary strengths. Markdown_Agent excels in presentation and structure while PlainText_Agent provides superior technical depth. Recommend combining structured formatting with detailed technical analysis for optimal migration documentation."
