Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive migration-readiness analyses for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS targeting Snowflake migration. Output_1 presents a more structured markdown format with clear section headers and tables, while Output_2 uses a more technical documentation style with detailed breakdowns. Both cover essential migration aspects including complexity metrics, compatibility checks, manual adjustments, and cost estimation. Key differences include formatting approach, complexity scoring (Output_1: 60, Output_2: 20), and level of technical detail in certain sections."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-45 vs Lines 1-38","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure migration from Oracle to Snowflake. They cover identical functional areas: procedure overview, complexity analysis, compatibility assessment, manual adjustments needed, and optimization recommendations. However, Output_1 provides more business-focused language while Output_2 offers more technical implementation details. The semantic intent and conclusions are highly aligned despite presentation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 6-45 vs Lines 12-38","Both outputs follow similar logical progression: metadata/overview → complexity metrics → compatibility analysis → manual adjustments → complexity scoring → optimization techniques → cost estimation. Output_1 uses numbered sections (1-8) with markdown formatting, while Output_2 uses numbered sections (1-7) with more technical documentation style. The flow and decomposition approach are largely consistent, with Output_1 having slightly more granular section breakdown."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,92,"Lines 15-16, 35-36","Output_1 demonstrates strong internal consistency and proper markdown formatting. Minor issues include: inconsistent table formatting in complexity metrics section (line 15-16), and some formatting inconsistencies in the API cost calculation section (lines 35-36). All references are consistent and the document structure is well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,88,"Lines 25-26, 45-47","Output_2 shows good technical accuracy and consistent formatting throughout. Minor issues include: slight inconsistency in metric counting (lines 25-26 show 38 vs 45 lines discrepancy with Output_1), and some formatting irregularities in the final cost breakdown section (lines 45-47). The technical content is accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with minor formatting and consistency issues. The average correctness score reflects strong technical accuracy and internal consistency across both analyses."
