Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS Oracle stored procedure. They cover identical core sections including overview, structure, data flow, mapping, complexity analysis, outputs, error handling, and API cost calculations. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in purpose and technical understanding, with structural similarities in section organization and content flow. Minor differences exist in presentation style, specific measurements, and detailed explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in understanding the LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS procedure's purpose, business value, and technical implementation. They consistently identify the same core components (MERGE operations, upsert logic, audit logging), business problems addressed (data synchronization, consistency), and enterprise benefits. Minor semantic differences include Agent_1 emphasizing 'timely decision-making' while Agent_2 focuses on 'reporting accuracy' (lines 15-20 in both outputs), and slight variations in describing performance considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 8 main sections in the same order. Section headers and subsection breakdowns are consistent. Key structural differences include: Agent_1 uses more bullet-point formatting in sections 1-2, while Agent_2 uses more paragraph-style text (lines 1-30). Agent_1 presents complexity analysis in a more compact table format, while Agent_2 uses expanded descriptions (lines 85-95). Both maintain logical flow from overview through technical details to cost analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 85-90, 110-115","Agent_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with properly formatted tables, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issues include: inconsistent spacing in the complexity analysis table (line 87) and a small formatting inconsistency in the API cost section where token calculations could be more clearly separated (lines 110-115). All Oracle-specific syntax references, table names, and procedure logic are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,93,"Lines 75-80, 120-125","Agent_2 shows strong syntactic correctness with well-structured content and accurate technical details. Minor issues include: slight inconsistency in table formatting within the complexity analysis section (lines 75-80) and a formatting issue in the final API cost breakdown where the formula presentation could be cleaner (lines 120-125). All technical references and Oracle syntax elements are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate Oracle terminology, proper table structures, and consistent technical references. The average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies rather than substantive technical errors. Both outputs would serve effectively as technical documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Agent_1 provides excellent technical documentation with strong attention to formatting consistency. Recommendations: 1) Standardize table spacing in complexity analysis section (line 87), 2) Improve clarity in API cost calculation presentation (lines 110-115), 3) Consider adding more specific performance metrics to enhance enterprise value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Agent_2 delivers comprehensive and well-structured documentation with good technical depth. Recommendations: 1) Enhance table formatting consistency in complexity analysis (lines 75-80), 2) Streamline the API cost formula presentation for better readability (lines 120-125), 3) Consider adding more bullet-point formatting for improved scanability in technical sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully document the Oracle procedure with high technical accuracy and business context. For optimal enterprise use: 1) Standardize formatting approaches across similar documentation, 2) Consider adding visual diagrams for data flow sections, 3) Include performance benchmarks and scalability considerations, 4) Add version control and change management sections for enterprise governance."
