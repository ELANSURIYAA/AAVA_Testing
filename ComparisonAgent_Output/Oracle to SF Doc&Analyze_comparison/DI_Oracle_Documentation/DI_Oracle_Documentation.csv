Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS. Agent_1 presents a more structured approach with clear section numbering and consistent formatting, while Agent_2 offers more detailed technical explanations and business context. Both documents cover the same core functionality - synchronizing agent data from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D using merge operations with audit logging."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical business requirements and technical functionality. They describe the same stored procedure with consistent understanding of the upsert logic, data flow from staging to gold tables, and audit logging mechanisms. Minor differences exist in emphasis and detail level but core semantic meaning is highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,,"Both documents follow similar logical structure with 8 main sections covering overview, code structure, data flow, mapping, complexity, outputs, error handling, and API cost. Agent_1 uses numbered sections (1-8) while Agent_2 uses dashed separators. Agent_1 presents information in more tabular format while Agent_2 uses more descriptive paragraphs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 45, 60","Minor inconsistencies in line count reporting (45 vs 38 lines) and complexity scoring methodology. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper table references and accurate technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,"Line 85","Very minor discrepancy in complexity score calculation (20 vs 60). All technical references, table names, and procedural descriptions are accurate and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical details, proper Oracle syntax references, and consistent business logic descriptions. Minor scoring methodology differences do not impact overall technical accuracy."
