Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical purpose and business understanding. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with both following numbered section formats, though Agent_2_Output provides more detailed complexity metrics. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) as documentation artifacts. Overall assessment: 93/100 - These are high-quality, aligned documentation outputs with minor structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-10, 15-25, 35-45","Both outputs correctly identify the procedure's purpose as agent data synchronization from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D using upsert logic. Business problem understanding is identical - reducing manual intervention and ensuring data accuracy. Both recognize enterprise data warehousing alignment and analytics benefits. Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Agent_1_Output focuses more on 'efficient and reliable synchronization' while Agent_2_Output emphasizes 'incremental data loads' and 'scalability'."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-5, 20-30, 60-70","Both follow numbered section structure (1-8) with similar headings. Agent_1_Output uses more concise bullet-point formatting, while Agent_2_Output provides more detailed subsections and tabular data. Key structural differences: Agent_2_Output includes more granular complexity metrics (line 38 vs 45 lines), more detailed cost breakdowns, and enhanced table formatting. Both maintain logical flow from overview to technical details to outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. All table structures are valid, cost calculations are mathematically correct ($0.117), and Oracle-specific terminology is used appropriately."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,,"Documentation is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent technical terminology, and accurate Oracle references. Table structures are well-formed, cost calculations are mathematically sound ($0.126), and all technical details align with Oracle PL/SQL standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness as documentation artifacts. No formatting errors, broken references, or inconsistent terminology detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Maintain the concise and clear presentation style. Consider adding more detailed complexity metrics similar to Agent_2_Output for enhanced technical depth. The cost calculation methodology is sound but could benefit from more detailed breakdown presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Excellent detailed complexity analysis and comprehensive cost breakdown. The enhanced table formatting and granular metrics provide superior technical documentation. Consider maintaining this level of detail as a standard for technical documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate high-quality technical documentation standards. Future iterations should combine Agent_1_Output's conciseness with Agent_2_Output's detailed metrics. Consider standardizing on the more comprehensive complexity analysis approach shown in Agent_2_Output while maintaining clear, accessible presentation."
