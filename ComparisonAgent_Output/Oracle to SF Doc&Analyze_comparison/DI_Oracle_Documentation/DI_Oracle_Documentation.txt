# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Oracle stored procedure LOAD_GOLD_AGENTS. Agent_1 presents a more structured approach with clear section numbering and consistent formatting, while Agent_2 offers more detailed technical explanations and business context. Both documents cover the same core functionality - synchronizing agent data from STAGE_AGENTS to GOLD_AGENTS_D using merge operations with audit logging.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address identical business requirements and technical functionality. They describe the same stored procedure with consistent understanding of the upsert logic, data flow from staging to gold tables, and audit logging mechanisms. The core semantic meaning is highly aligned with both documents explaining:

- Purpose: Synchronizing agent data from staging to gold layer
- Business value: Supporting enterprise data warehousing and analytics
- Technical approach: Using MERGE operations for upserts
- Error handling: Comprehensive audit logging

Minor differences exist in emphasis and detail level but do not impact the fundamental semantic alignment.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both documents follow similar logical structure with 8 main sections covering:
1. Overview of Program
2. Code Structure and Design  
3. Data Flow and Processing Logic
4. Data Mapping
5. Complexity Analysis
6. Key Outputs
7. Error Handling and Logging
8. API Cost
