Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-85,"Both agents successfully generated cost and effort estimation documents for Snowflake stored procedure conversion from Oracle PL/SQL. Agent_1_Detailed provides comprehensive analysis with higher cost estimates ($30.382 USD runtime, 41 total hours), while Agent_2_Streamlined offers focused estimates with lower costs ($0.03 USD runtime, 10 total hours). Key differences include data volume assumptions, calculation methodologies, and granularity of effort breakdown. Both outputs are structurally sound and syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-85,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: Snowflake runtime cost estimation and manual effort estimation for code conversion. However, they differ significantly in assumptions and scope. Agent_1_Detailed assumes larger data volumes (17GB processed, $30 compute cost) while Agent_2_Streamlined assumes smaller volumes (2MB processed, $0.03 cost). Both include API cost calculations but with different token estimates. The fundamental approach and intent are aligned, but execution differs substantially in scale and detail."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-85,"Both outputs follow nearly identical high-level structure: (1) Cost Estimation with Runtime Cost subsection, (2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with manual fixes and optimization subsections. Agent_1_Detailed uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1, 2.2) while Agent_2_Streamlined uses similar numbering. Both conclude with API cost calculations and summary tables. The logical flow and decomposition approach are highly similar, with Agent_2_Streamlined adding a comprehensive summary table that Agent_1_Detailed lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Detailed,95,Lines 15-20,"Well-structured document with proper formatting and calculations. Minor issue: inconsistent token pricing reference (appears to contain GitHub token rather than pricing unit) in lines 19-20. All other syntax, mathematical calculations, and structural elements are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Streamlined,98,Lines 1-85,"Excellent structural formatting with proper markdown syntax, consistent numbering, and well-organized content. All calculations are mathematically sound. Summary table is properly formatted. Only minor formatting inconsistency in the final notes section spacing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper document structure, valid calculations, and consistent formatting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Detailed,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Correct the token pricing reference error and clarify data volume assumptions. Consider adding a summary table similar to Agent_2_Streamlined for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Streamlined,N/A,Lines 80-85,"Excellent overall structure. Consider providing more detailed breakdown of cost calculations similar to Agent_1_Detailed to enhance transparency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-85,"Both agents should align on data volume assumptions and calculation methodologies for consistency. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_1_Detailed's comprehensive calculations with Agent_2_Streamlined's clear summary presentation."
