Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address Oracle PL/SQL to Snowflake conversion cost estimation but show significant divergence in estimates. Output 1 estimates $30.382 runtime cost and 41 total hours, while Output 2 estimates $0.03 runtime cost and 10 hours. Both follow similar structural approaches but differ substantially in assumptions and calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-15, 25-35","Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Snowflake conversion costs and effort. However, they diverge significantly in cost calculations ($30.382 vs $0.03 for runtime) and effort estimates (41 vs 10 hours). The semantic intent is aligned but execution assumptions differ substantially, particularly in data volume estimates and complexity assessments."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-50, Section headers","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Cost Estimation and Code Fixing sections. Both include API costs and breakdown estimates. Output 2 provides more detailed summary table and clearer organization with numbered sections. Flow and logical decomposition are comparable but Output 2 has superior presentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,95,"Lines 20-25, 40-45","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting and logical flow. Minor issues include inconsistent decimal precision in cost calculations and some redundant phrasing. All internal references are consistent and calculations follow logical progression."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,98,"Lines 1-50","Excellent documentation structure with clear formatting, consistent terminology, and well-organized summary table. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in the summary section. All calculations are clearly presented and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,N/A,"Lines 10-20, 30-40","Reconcile data volume assumptions and cost calculation methodology. The $30+ runtime cost seems inflated compared to industry standards. Review compute credit estimates and storage cost calculations for accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,N/A,"Lines 15-25","Validate the extremely low $0.03 runtime cost estimate against realistic data volumes. Consider if assumptions about 10,000 records and simple operations adequately represent typical enterprise scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All sections","Establish standardized assumptions for data volume, complexity, and Snowflake pricing models. Create unified estimation framework to ensure consistency across similar conversion projects. Both outputs would benefit from sensitivity analysis showing cost ranges based on different data volume scenarios."
