# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for Snowflake stored procedure migration from Oracle PL/SQL. Agent_1 focuses on detailed runtime cost calculations with specific data volumes and pricing breakdowns, while Agent_2 provides a more structured approach with clear effort categorization and includes a summary table. Both address the core requirements but with different levels of detail and organization.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same fundamental goal of providing cost and effort estimation for Snowflake migration. Agent_1 provides more granular cost calculations ($30.382 vs $0.03) based on larger data assumptions (50GB+120GB vs 2MB), while Agent_2 uses more conservative estimates. Both cover manual code fixes, optimization, and API costs, but with different effort hour estimates (41 vs 10 total hours).

**Key Differences:**
- **Data Volume Assumptions**: Agent_1 assumes processing ~170GB total data vs Agent_2's ~2MB
- **Runtime Costs**: Agent_1 calculates $30.382 vs Agent_2's $0.03 per execution
- **Total Effort Hours**: Agent_1 estimates 41 hours (26+15) vs Agent_2's 10 hours (7+3)
- **Cost Calculation Approach**: Agent_1 uses credit-based pricing, Agent_2 uses per-second warehouse billing

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Agent_1 uses a numbered hierarchical structure (1.1, 2.1, 2.2) with detailed sub-calculations. Agent_2 employs a similar numbered structure but adds a comprehensive summary table at the end. Both follow logical flow: Cost Estimation → Code Fixing → Optimization, but Agent_2 provides better visual organization with the tabular summary.

**Structural Elements:**
- Both use numbered sections (1.1, 2.1, 2.2)
- Both separate runtime costs from effort estimation
- Agent_2 includes a structured summary table
- Agent_1 provides more granular calculation breakdowns
- Both include API cost calculations

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 90/100)**
- Syntax and formatting are correct
- Mathematical calculations are accurate: 10 credits × $3 = $30, (17/1024) × $23 = $0.382
- API cost calculation is properly structured
- **Minor Issue**: Inconsistent token pricing reference '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s' appears to be a formatting error (lines 35-36)

**Agent_2 (Score: 95/100)**
- Excellent syntax and internal consistency
- Mathematical calculations are accurate: 60 seconds × $0.00056 = $0.0336
- Clear breakdown of effort hours (2+2+2+1=7, 1+1+1=3)
- Summary table format is well-structured and consistent
- API cost properly calculated and referenced

**Overall Correctness: 93/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Correctness | 90 | 95 | 93 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **84** |

## Recommendations

### For Agent_1:
- Consider adopting Agent_2's structured summary table format for better readability
- Fix the token pricing reference formatting error
- Provide rationale for the significantly higher data volume assumptions compared to Agent_2

### For Agent_2:
- Excellent structure and clarity
- Consider providing more detailed cost breakdown calculations similar to Agent_1's approach
- The conservative data volume estimates may need validation against actual production scenarios

### For Both Outputs:
1. **Standardize data volume assumptions** for consistency between estimates
2. **Clear documentation of assumption sources** to justify the significant differences in data volume estimates
3. **Range estimates (min/max)** rather than point estimates to account for variability
4. **Integration approach**: Combine Agent_1's detailed calculations with Agent_2's structured summaries for optimal output
