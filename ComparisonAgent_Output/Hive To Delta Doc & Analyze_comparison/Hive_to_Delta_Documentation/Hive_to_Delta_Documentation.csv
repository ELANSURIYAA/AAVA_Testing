Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Hive script calculating top 3 categories by revenue per region. Agent_1_Output demonstrates superior organization with structured sections, detailed data mapping tables, and precise complexity metrics. Agent_2_Output offers valuable business context and Delta migration insights but has less structured presentation. Both outputs are technically accurate with minor syntactic variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical business objectives and technical requirements. Agent_1_Output focuses on structured documentation with clear KPI definitions and step-by-step query breakdown. Agent_2_Output emphasizes business context and practical applications. Core semantic intent is highly aligned with 92% similarity due to consistent understanding of the Hive script's purpose, data sources, and expected outcomes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-30 (headers and sections)","Both outputs follow similar 7-section structure but with different organizational approaches. Agent_1_Output uses numbered sections with clear hierarchical formatting. Agent_2_Output uses a flatter structure with less consistent formatting. Both cover: script overview, query breakdown, data mapping, complexity metrics, outputs, optimization, and API costs. Structural alignment is good but presentation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,"Lines 15-25 (complexity metrics)","Highly accurate technical content with precise complexity metrics (26 lines, 3 tables, 2 joins, 3 CTEs). Minor formatting inconsistencies in markdown structure. Data mapping table is well-formatted and complete. All technical details are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,88,"Lines 20-35 (complexity metrics), Lines 45-50 (API cost)","Generally accurate with good technical depth. Complexity metrics show slight discrepancy (31 lines vs 26). API cost calculation methodology is more detailed but includes speculative estimates. Some formatting inconsistencies in section headers and bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score reflects high technical accuracy in both outputs with minor presentation and formatting variations. Both demonstrate strong understanding of Hive SQL concepts and documentation requirements."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Lines 1-50","Maintain structured approach and precise metrics. Enhance business context sections to match Agent_2_Output's depth. Consider adding Delta migration insights for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Lines 1-50","Improve document structure and formatting consistency. Verify complexity metrics for accuracy. Maintain strong business context while enhancing technical precision to match Agent_1_Output's level of detail."
