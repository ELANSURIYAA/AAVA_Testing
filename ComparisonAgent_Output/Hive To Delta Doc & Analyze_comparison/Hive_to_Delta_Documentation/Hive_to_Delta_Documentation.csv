Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comprehensive comparison of two Hive script documentation outputs reveals high semantic and structural similarity with excellent correctness scores. Both agents produced detailed, well-structured documentation covering script overview, query breakdown, data mapping, complexity metrics, and optimization considerations. Minor differences exist in formatting, section organization, and specific details like line counts and API cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate nearly identical semantic intent and meaning. They address the same Hive script with consistent explanations of purpose (top 3 categories by revenue per region), data sources (sales, products, regions), and KPI definitions (total_revenue, avg_order_value, category_rank). Core business logic explanations are semantically equivalent with minor variations in phrasing and emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs follow highly similar structural patterns with 7 numbered sections covering identical topics. Key structural similarities include: CTE breakdown approach, data mapping table format, complexity metrics categorization, and optimization discussion flow. Minor structural differences include Agent_2_Documentation having more detailed subsections and slightly different ordering of complexity metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Documentation,98,Lines 15-16,"Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-formed documentation structure. Minor issue: Line count stated as 26 lines may not align with actual script complexity described."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Documentation,96,Lines 18-20,"Very good syntactic correctness with proper formatting and structure. Minor issues: Line count stated as 31 lines differs from Agent_1_Documentation, and API cost calculation methodology could be more clearly explained in lines 18-20."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 97 indicates both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with only minor inconsistencies in quantitative details."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Documentation,N/A,Lines 15-16,"Verify line count accuracy and ensure quantitative metrics align with actual script complexity. Consider adding more detailed subsections for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Documentation,N/A,Lines 18-20,"Clarify API cost calculation methodology and ensure consistency in quantitative details. The additional detail in subsections is beneficial and should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent documentation quality. Consider standardizing quantitative metrics (line counts, API costs) and formatting conventions for future consistency. The comprehensive coverage of all documentation aspects makes both outputs highly valuable for technical teams."
