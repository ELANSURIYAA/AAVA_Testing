Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the same Hive script analyzing sales data. Agent 1 provides more structured formatting with clear markdown tables and detailed complexity metrics, while Agent 2 offers more business context and migration considerations. Key differences include API cost calculations (0.0012 vs 0.00020 USD), formatting approaches, and depth of technical details. Overall quality is high for both outputs with Agent 1 showing superior organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-150,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting a Hive script for top 3 category revenue analysis by region. Agent 1 focuses more on technical documentation structure while Agent 2 emphasizes business context and Delta migration aspects. Both cover the same KPIs (total_revenue, avg_order_value, category_rank) and query logic. Minor semantic differences in business problem framing and optimization discussions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,1-150,"Both follow numbered section approach but with different organizational patterns. Agent 1 uses 7 main sections with clear subsections and markdown tables, while Agent 2 uses similar structure but with different emphasis. Agent 1 includes dedicated 'Data Mapping Details' table (lines 45-55) while Agent 2 integrates this information differently. Both include complexity metrics but Agent 1 provides more systematic breakdown."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,1-150,"Agent 1 output shows excellent syntax and formatting. Well-structured markdown with proper table formatting, consistent numbering, and clear section breaks. Minor issues: some redundant information in sections 4-5. API cost format is properly structured. All technical references are accurate and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,1-150,"Agent 2 output demonstrates good technical accuracy with proper markdown formatting. Some inconsistencies in section numbering and table formatting (lines 65-75). Business context is well-integrated but some technical details are less systematically organized. API cost calculation methodology is less clear than Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs maintain high technical accuracy with proper documentation standards. Agent 1 shows slightly better structural consistency and formatting precision."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Maintain current structured approach with clear markdown tables and systematic organization. Consider adding more business context similar to Agent 2's approach. The detailed complexity metrics and data mapping tables are valuable and should be retained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Improve structural consistency and formatting precision. The business context and Delta migration considerations are excellent additions. Consider adopting more systematic organization similar to Agent 1's approach for technical details and complexity metrics."
