Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 produced comprehensive documentation for the HiveHQL_Sales_Category_Revenue.sql script. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical understanding of the business problem and technical requirements. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) with both following similar documentation frameworks. Correctness scores are high for both agents (Agent_1: 98/100, Agent_2: 96/100) with minor formatting and detail variations. Overall assessment shows strong consistency between outputs with Agent_1 providing slightly more structured presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in understanding the core business problem: calculating top 3 product categories by revenue per region over 12 months. Key semantic similarities include: (1) Identical purpose identification - revenue analysis by category and region, (2) Same KPI definitions - total_revenue as SUM(quantity * price) and avg_order_value as AVG(quantity * price), (3) Consistent data source identification - sales, products, regions tables, (4) Aligned query logic understanding - 12-month filtering, aggregation, and ranking approach. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 uses more formal business language while Agent_2 includes more technical implementation details. Score: 95/100 - Nearly identical semantic understanding with superficial presentation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow highly similar structural organization with 7 main sections: Script Overview, Query Breakdown, Data Mapping Details, Complexity Metrics, Key Outputs, Error Handling/Optimization, and API Cost Calculation. Structural alignment includes: (1) Both use numbered sections (1-7), (2) Query breakdown follows identical 4-step CTE analysis, (3) Data mapping presented in tabular format, (4) Complexity metrics cover same categories. Structural differences: Agent_1 uses more consistent markdown formatting and bullet points, Agent_2 includes additional subsection headers and more detailed technical explanations. Agent_1 presents 26 lines of code while Agent_2 reports 31 lines. Score: 92/100 - Excellent structural similarity with minor organizational variations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 15-20,"Agent_1 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness and internal consistency. Technical accuracy verified across: (1) Correct SQL syntax references and function names, (2) Accurate table relationships and join descriptions, (3) Consistent data type handling and transformation logic, (4) Proper CTE naming and flow description. Minor issues: Line 15-20 complexity metrics show 26 lines but could benefit from more detailed breakdown of conditional logic count. All internal references are consistent and formatting is properly structured. Score: 98/100."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,Lines 25-30,"Agent_2 output shows strong syntactic correctness with comprehensive technical details. Strengths include: (1) Accurate SQL function and syntax descriptions, (2) Detailed Hive vs Delta syntax comparison, (3) Comprehensive error handling discussion, (4) Thorough optimization recommendations. Minor issues: Lines 25-30 show slight inconsistency in complexity metrics presentation and API cost calculation methodology differs from Agent_1. Some formatting inconsistencies in data mapping table structure. Score: 96/100."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Overall correctness assessment based on average of individual agent scores: (98 + 96) / 2 = 97. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy, proper syntax usage, and internal consistency. The documentation correctly represents the Hive script functionality and provides accurate technical analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Agent_1 provides excellent structured documentation with consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage. Strengths include clear section organization, accurate technical details, and professional presentation. Recommendation: Maintain current documentation structure and consider adding more detailed error handling examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,N/A,"Agent_2 offers comprehensive technical analysis with valuable Hive vs Delta comparisons and detailed optimization insights. Strengths include thorough technical explanations and practical migration guidance. Recommendation: Improve formatting consistency and standardize complexity metrics presentation to match industry standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents demonstrate strong capability in technical documentation generation. For future improvements: (1) Standardize complexity metrics methodology, (2) Align API cost calculation approaches, (3) Enhance cross-referencing between sections, (4) Consider adding visual diagrams for complex query flows. Overall, both outputs provide valuable and accurate documentation suitable for technical and business stakeholders."
