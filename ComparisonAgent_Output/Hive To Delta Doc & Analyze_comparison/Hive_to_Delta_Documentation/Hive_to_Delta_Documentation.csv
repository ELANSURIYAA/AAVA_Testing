Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two comprehensive Hive script documentation outputs analyzed. First_Output provides more structured formatting with clear markdown headers and detailed data mapping tables. Second_Output offers similar content with additional business context and cost calculations. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with minor differences in presentation and depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting Hive script for top 3 categories by revenue per region over 12 months. Both cover same KPI definitions (total_revenue, avg_order_value, category_rank), identical query breakdown with 3 CTEs, and same business purpose. Minor semantic differences in emphasis on business context vs technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both follow similar 7-section structure: Overview, Query Breakdown, Data Mapping, Complexity Metrics, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost. First_Output uses more consistent markdown formatting with clear headers. Second_Output includes additional subsections like 'Business Problem Addressed' and 'Hive vs Delta Syntax Differences'. Both maintain logical flow but with different organizational emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-60","Well-formed markdown with consistent header hierarchy. Accurate technical details for CTEs, joins, and aggregations. Minor formatting inconsistencies in table structure. All code references and syntax descriptions are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,93,"Lines 20-35, 70-85","Generally well-structured with accurate technical content. Some inconsistencies in section numbering and formatting. Cost calculation methodology clearly explained. Minor issues with table formatting and some redundant explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical descriptions, proper markdown structure, and consistent internal references. Average of individual scores reflects strong overall quality."
