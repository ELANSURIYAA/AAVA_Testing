Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the HiveHQL_Sales_Category_Revenue.sql script with similar overall structure and content coverage. Key differences include API cost calculations (Agent_1: $0.0012 vs Agent_2: $0.00020), section organization depth, and specific technical details. Both outputs successfully address the core documentation requirements with high semantic alignment but notable structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: documenting a Hive script that calculates top 3 categories by revenue per region over 12 months. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Same business purpose and KPI definitions, (2) Identical query logic breakdown across CTEs, (3) Same data sources and transformations, (4) Consistent complexity metrics. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 focuses more on Delta migration benefits (lines 45-48), while Agent_2 provides more detailed Hive vs Delta syntax comparisons (lines 25-28)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar 7-section structure: Script Overview, Query Breakdown, Data Mapping, Complexity Metrics, Key Outputs, Error Handling, API Cost. Structural differences: (1) Agent_1 uses more detailed subsection headers and bullet formatting, (2) Agent_2 includes explicit 'Business Problem Addressed' subsection (lines 8-10), (3) Agent_1 provides more granular data mapping table with transformation details, (4) Agent_2 includes Hive vs Delta syntax comparison section not present in Agent_1. Section ordering is nearly identical with minor organizational variations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Syntax and internal consistency are excellent. Minor issues: (1) Table reference formatting could be more consistent in data mapping section, (2) All technical details are accurate and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 22-24,"Good syntax and internal consistency. Minor issues: (1) Some inconsistent formatting in complexity metrics section, (2) API cost calculation explanation could be more precise (lines 58-62), (3) Minor grammatical inconsistencies in technical descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, accurate technical content, and consistent internal references. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting and precision issues in both outputs."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-48,"Strengths: Excellent technical accuracy, comprehensive data mapping details, strong Delta migration insights. Improvements: Standardize table formatting, add more explicit Hive vs Delta syntax comparisons, consider adding business impact metrics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-62,"Strengths: Good business context integration, clear syntax comparisons, comprehensive coverage. Improvements: Enhance API cost calculation precision, standardize formatting consistency, expand on optimization recommendations for production environments."
