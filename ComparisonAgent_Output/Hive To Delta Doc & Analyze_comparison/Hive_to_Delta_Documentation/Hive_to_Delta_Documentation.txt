# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Hive script calculating top 3 categories by revenue per region. Agent_1_Output demonstrates superior organization with structured sections, detailed data mapping tables, and precise complexity metrics. Agent_2_Output offers valuable business context and Delta migration insights but has less structured presentation. Both outputs are technically accurate with minor syntactic variations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address identical business objectives and technical requirements with high semantic alignment. Agent_1_Output focuses on structured documentation with clear KPI definitions and step-by-step query breakdown, while Agent_2_Output emphasizes business context and practical applications. The core semantic intent is highly aligned at 92% similarity due to consistent understanding of the Hive script's purpose, data sources, and expected outcomes. Both correctly identify the script's goal of calculating top 3 categories by revenue for each region over the past 12 months.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs follow a similar 7-section structure but with different organizational approaches. Agent_1_Output uses numbered sections (1-7) with clear hierarchical formatting and consistent markdown structure. Agent_2_Output uses a flatter structure with less consistent formatting and numbering. Both cover the essential elements: script overview, query breakdown, data mapping, complexity metrics, key outputs, error handling/optimization, and API costs. The structural alignment is good but presentation differs significantly, affecting readability and professional appearance.

### Correctness

**Agent_1_Output (Score: 95/100)**
Demonstrates highly accurate technical content with precise complexity metrics (26 lines, 3 tables, 2 joins, 3 CTEs). The data mapping table is well-formatted and complete with clear source-to-destination mappings. All technical details are syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting. Minor deductions for some formatting inconsistencies in the markdown structure.

**Agent_2_Output (Score: 88/100)**
Generally accurate with good technical depth and valuable business insights. However, shows slight discrepancy in complexity metrics (31 lines vs 26 reported by Agent_1). The API cost calculation methodology is more detailed but includes speculative estimates that may not reflect actual costs. Some formatting inconsistencies in section headers and bullet points reduce overall presentation quality.

**Overall Correctness: 92/100**
