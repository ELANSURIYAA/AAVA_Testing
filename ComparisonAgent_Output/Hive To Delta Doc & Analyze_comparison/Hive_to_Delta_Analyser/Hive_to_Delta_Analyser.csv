Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both agents analyzed the same Hive to Delta conversion script focusing on complexity metrics and syntax differences. Agent_1_Overview provided a concise technical assessment with 26 lines and complexity score 20/100. Agent_2_Detailed offered comprehensive analysis with 31 lines and complexity score 25/100. Both identified similar core issues: date function conversion (ADD_MONTHS), window function syntax, and minimal manual adjustments required. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in identifying conversion requirements but differ in structural presentation and analytical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-26 vs 1-31,"Both agents correctly identify the script's purpose (top 3 categories by revenue per region over 12 months), same complexity factors (3 tables, 2 joins, 3 CTEs), and identical syntax conversion needs (ADD_MONTHS replacement, window function adjustments). Minor semantic differences: Agent_1_Overview focuses on technical metrics while Agent_2_Detailed emphasizes business context and KPI definitions. Both reach same conclusions about conversion complexity and optimization approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,Lines 1-26 vs 1-31,"Significant structural differences in presentation approach. Agent_1_Overview uses numbered sections (1-7) with bullet points for metrics. Agent_2_Detailed uses markdown-style headers with detailed subsections and includes complete SQL script reproduction (lines 20-31). Both follow logical flow: overview → complexity → syntax → adjustments → optimization, but Agent_2_Detailed adds business context sections and KPI definitions not present in Agent_1_Overview."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Overview,95,Lines 8-12,"Minor syntax reference issue: mentions 'DISTRIBUTE BY' vs 'PARTITION BY' distinction but script actually uses PARTITION BY correctly. All other technical details accurate: table counts, join types, CTE usage, and complexity scoring methodology sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Detailed,98,Lines 15-31,"Highly accurate technical analysis with proper SQL syntax reproduction. Correctly identifies all Hive-specific constructs and Delta conversion requirements. Minor formatting inconsistency in window function description but all technical content is precise and verifiable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy in identifying conversion requirements and complexity factors. Agent_2_Detailed shows slightly higher precision in syntax details and complete script reproduction."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Overview,,Lines 1-26,"Strengthen structural presentation by adding business context sections and KPI definitions. Include complete SQL script reproduction for verification. Expand on optimization techniques with specific Delta Lake features."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Detailed,,Lines 1-31,"Maintain comprehensive analytical depth while streamlining presentation structure. Consider adding more quantitative complexity metrics. Excellent technical accuracy and completeness should be preserved."
