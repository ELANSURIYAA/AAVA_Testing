Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-31, All sections","Both outputs analyze the same Hive to Delta conversion task for a sales category revenue script. Concise_Analysis provides a structured 7-section analysis (26 lines) while Detailed_Analysis offers comprehensive documentation with actual SQL code (31+ lines). Both identify similar complexity scores (20 vs 25), same core syntax differences (date functions, window clauses), and recommend refactoring over rebuilding. Key difference: Detailed_Analysis includes complete SQL code and more thorough business context."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-7 vs Lines 1-31","Both outputs address identical goals: analyzing Hive to Delta conversion complexity for sales category revenue calculation. Core semantic alignment on: business purpose (top 3 categories by revenue per region), technical approach (CTEs, joins, window functions), and conversion strategy (refactor vs rebuild). Minor divergence in emphasis: Concise_Analysis focuses on technical metrics while Detailed_Analysis emphasizes business context and KPI definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Section organization varies","Both follow logical analytical flow but with different structural approaches. Concise_Analysis uses numbered sections (1-7) with bullet points and compact formatting. Detailed_Analysis uses markdown headers with detailed subsections and code blocks. Common structural elements: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Detailed_Analysis adds KPI definitions and complete SQL code section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Concise_Analysis,95,"Lines 8-12, 20-22","Syntax and internal consistency excellent. Minor issues: Line 11 mentions 'AVG' in aggregate functions but this refers to avg_order_value calculation in the actual query logic. Line 22 complexity score rationale could be more detailed. All technical specifications accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Detailed_Analysis,98,"Lines 15-20, SQL block","Exceptional syntax correctness and internal consistency. Complete SQL code provided with proper Hive syntax. All technical details accurate including table schemas, join logic, and window functions. Minor: Line 18 mentions 'WINDOW w AS...' clause in SQL that may be redundant but syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical specifications and consistent internal references. Average of individual scores reflects strong quality across both analyses."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Concise_Analysis,88,"Lines 20-25","Strengthen by adding: 1) Complete SQL code examples for verification, 2) More detailed business context and KPI definitions, 3) Expanded optimization recommendations with specific Delta Lake features, 4) More granular complexity scoring rationale."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Detailed_Analysis,90,"Lines 25-31, SQL section","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Minor enhancements: 1) Consider adding performance benchmarking estimates, 2) Include specific Delta Lake optimization commands (OPTIMIZE, ZORDER), 3) Add migration timeline estimates, 4) Consider adding error handling scenarios for the conversion process."
