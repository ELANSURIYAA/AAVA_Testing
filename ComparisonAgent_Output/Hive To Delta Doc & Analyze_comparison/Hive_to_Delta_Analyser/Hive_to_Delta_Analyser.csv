Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive analyses of a Hive to Delta conversion script. Agent_2 delivers a more detailed and structured approach with complete SQL script inclusion, while Agent_1 provides a concise but complete analysis. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the conversion requirements and technical considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-26 (Agent_1), Lines 1-31 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Hive to Delta conversion. They cover identical key areas: script overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization techniques. Agent_2 provides more detailed business context and KPI definitions (lines 8-15), while Agent_1 is more direct. Both reach similar conclusions about conversion complexity (20/100 vs 25/100) and refactor recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Section headers 1-7 in both outputs","Both outputs follow identical numbered section structure (1-7) covering the same analytical framework. Agent_2 enhances structure with subsection headers, clear separators (---), and additional formatting. Agent_1 uses bullet points for metrics while Agent_2 uses descriptive paragraphs. Agent_2 includes complete SQL script content (lines 95-125) which Agent_1 lacks. Overall flow and logical progression are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 1-26","Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical details. Minor issue: complexity score of 20/100 may be slightly low given the identified syntax differences and manual adjustments required."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 1-125","Agent_2 output is highly accurate with proper formatting, comprehensive technical details, and includes complete SQL script validation. Very minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section (line 89) but overall excellent correctness and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical analysis, proper syntax, and consistent internal references. Agent_2 slightly edges out with more comprehensive content and complete script inclusion."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Agent_1 provides solid foundational analysis but could benefit from: 1) Including complete SQL script content for full validation, 2) Adding more detailed business context and KPI definitions, 3) Expanding on optimization techniques with specific Delta Lake features."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Agent_2 delivers comprehensive analysis with excellent detail and completeness. Minor improvements could include: 1) Slightly more concise presentation in some sections, 2) Consistent formatting throughout all sections, 3) Cross-referencing line numbers more systematically."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully identify key conversion requirements and provide actionable insights. Agent_2's approach of including complete script content and detailed business context makes it more suitable for enterprise documentation, while Agent_1's concise approach works well for quick technical assessments."
