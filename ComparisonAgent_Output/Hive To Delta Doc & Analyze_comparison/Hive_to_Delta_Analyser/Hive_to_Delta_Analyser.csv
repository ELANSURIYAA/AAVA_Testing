Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Hive_to_Delta_Analyser outputs provide comprehensive analyses of converting a Hive HQL script to Delta format. Output_1 delivers a concise, structured analysis covering all essential conversion aspects. Output_2 provides more detailed explanations with enhanced business context and includes the complete SQL script. Both outputs correctly identify the script's purpose (top 3 categories by revenue per region), complexity metrics, and conversion requirements. Key differences lie in depth of explanation and presentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Hive to Delta conversion requirements. They identify identical technical elements: 3 tables, 2 joins, 3 CTEs, same aggregate functions, and similar complexity scores (20/100 vs 25/100). Both recognize the same syntax differences (ADD_MONTHS function, window functions) and recommend similar manual adjustments. Output_2 provides more business context and detailed explanations, while Output_1 is more concise. The semantic intent and technical understanding are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 7 main sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Estimation. The logical flow and decomposition approach are consistent. Output_2 includes additional subsections and more detailed breakdowns within each section, plus the complete SQL script content, but maintains the same overall structure and progression of analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 8-12,"Output_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with accurate technical metrics and valid analysis structure. Minor issue: complexity score of 20/100 may be slightly underestimated given the presence of window functions and multiple CTEs. All technical details are accurately presented and internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,Lines 15-20,"Output_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive technical analysis and valid SQL script inclusion. The complexity score of 25/100 is more appropriately calibrated. All sections are well-structured with consistent formatting and accurate technical details. Minor formatting inconsistencies in section headers but overall very strong."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical analysis and consistent internal structure. Output_2 slightly edges ahead with more comprehensive coverage and better calibrated complexity scoring."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Consider expanding business context explanations and including the actual SQL script content for completeness. The complexity score could be slightly increased to better reflect the presence of window functions and multiple CTEs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing section header formatting for consistency. The detailed approach with business context and complete script inclusion is highly valuable for stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide solid technical analysis for Hive to Delta conversion. Output_2's approach of including comprehensive business context and the complete SQL script makes it more suitable for stakeholder communication, while Output_1's concise format is efficient for technical teams. Consider combining the conciseness of Output_1 with the comprehensive context of Output_2 for optimal results."
