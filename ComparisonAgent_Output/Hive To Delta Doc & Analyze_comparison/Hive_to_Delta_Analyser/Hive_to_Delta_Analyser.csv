Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive analyses of a Hive-to-Delta conversion task for a sales category revenue script. Agent_1_Output delivers a concise, structured analysis with clear metrics and actionable insights. Agent_2_Output provides more detailed explanations with comprehensive business context and includes the complete SQL code. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with minor differences in presentation depth and format."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing a Hive script for Delta conversion. They cover identical key areas including complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity scoring, optimization techniques, and API cost estimation. Agent_1_Output provides complexity score 20/100 while Agent_2_Output provides 25/100, showing slight variance in assessment but same understanding. Both identify the same critical conversion points: date function replacement (ADD_MONTHS), window function syntax, and data type compatibility. The semantic alignment is very strong with only minor differences in scoring methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 7 main sections: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Estimation. Agent_1_Output uses a more concise bullet-point format throughout, while Agent_2_Output employs detailed subsections with comprehensive explanations and includes the complete SQL code at the end. The logical flow and information hierarchy are essentially the same, with Agent_2_Output providing additional depth in each section. Both use consistent numbering and clear section delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 8-9,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-structured content and consistent formatting. Minor issue: Lists 'AVG' as an aggregate function in line 9 but the actual script uses AVG for calculated metrics, not as a primary aggregate in the complexity count context. All technical references are accurate and internal consistency is maintained throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,Lines 45-46,"Agent_2_Output shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive structure and detailed explanations. Very minor formatting inconsistency in the window function explanation where it mentions removing 'explicit WINDOW clause' but the provided SQL code actually includes a WINDOW clause (lines 45-46 in the SQL section). All other technical details, code references, and internal consistency are exemplary."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with only minor syntactic or consistency issues that do not impact the overall quality or usability of the analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,N/A,"Excellent concise analysis format ideal for quick technical reviews. Consider adding the actual SQL code for complete reference and expanding business context explanations to match the comprehensiveness of technical details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,N/A,"Outstanding comprehensive analysis with excellent business context and complete code inclusion. Minor improvement: ensure consistency between explanatory text and provided code examples, particularly regarding window function syntax descriptions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable Hive-to-Delta conversion analysis with complementary strengths. Agent_1_Output excels in conciseness and clarity, while Agent_2_Output provides comprehensive detail and business context. For enterprise use, combining the concise format of Agent_1_Output with the comprehensive detail and code inclusion of Agent_2_Output would create an optimal analysis document."
