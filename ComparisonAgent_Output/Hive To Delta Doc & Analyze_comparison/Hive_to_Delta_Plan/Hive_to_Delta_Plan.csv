Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two agent outputs provide cost and effort estimates for Hive to Delta migration testing. Agent_1 delivers a concise estimate with $0.90 runtime cost and 9 hours effort. Agent_2 provides comprehensive analysis with $0.01245-$0.06225 runtime cost range and 12 hours effort. Both address the same core requirements but with significantly different approaches and detail levels."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs address Hive to Delta migration cost estimation and testing effort. Agent_1 focuses on high-level estimates while Agent_2 provides detailed breakdown with ranges and comprehensive reasoning. Core intent is aligned but Agent_2 demonstrates deeper analysis of DBU costs, data volumes, and validation processes. Semantic alignment is good despite different granularity levels."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,All,"Agent_1 uses simple numbered sections (1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing, 3. API Cost). Agent_2 employs comprehensive structure with detailed subsections, tables, and markdown formatting. Both follow logical flow from cost to effort to API cost, but Agent_2 includes additional validation steps and summary tables. Structure overlap exists but execution approaches differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,Lines 3-5,"Syntax is clean with minor formatting inconsistencies. DBU cost calculation appears simplified ($0.45/hour rate). Data volume (450 GB) and runtime (2 hours) estimates are stated without detailed justification. API cost format is correct but lacks context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 1-50,"Excellent syntax and formatting throughout. Comprehensive calculations with proper ranges ($0.15-$0.75 DBU rates). All estimates include detailed reasoning and assumptions. Minor formatting variations in markdown but overall structure is consistent and professional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,All,"Both outputs are syntactically correct with Agent_2 demonstrating superior formatting and detail. Agent_1 has minor presentation issues but core content is valid. Average correctness is high with Agent_2 setting the standard for comprehensive analysis."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-10,"Enhance cost analysis with DBU rate ranges and detailed data volume justification. Add comprehensive validation steps and output comparison processes. Include summary tables for better readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Maintain current comprehensive approach as it demonstrates thorough analysis. Consider adding more specific timeline estimates for testing phases. Excellent standard for migration effort estimation documentation."
