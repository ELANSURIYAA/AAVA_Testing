Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide cost and effort estimates for Hive to Delta migration testing, but with significant differences in scope, detail, and accuracy. Agent2_Comprehensive delivers a more thorough analysis with proper cost ranges, detailed breakdown, and comprehensive validation steps, while Agent1_Brief provides basic estimates with some calculation errors."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs address the same core goal of estimating costs and effort for Hive to Delta migration testing. They cover similar aspects: runtime costs, manual fixes, testing effort, and API costs. However, Agent2_Comprehensive provides more nuanced understanding with cost ranges, detailed reasoning, and comprehensive validation steps, while Agent1_Brief offers simplified estimates. The semantic alignment is good but differs in depth and sophistication."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,All,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, and API Cost sections. However, Agent2_Comprehensive uses more detailed subsections (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3), includes summary tables, and provides comprehensive documentation. Agent1_Brief uses simpler numbering (2.1) and lacks detailed breakdown. The overall flow is similar but organizational depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_Brief,60,Lines 3-6,"Syntax is valid but contains calculation errors. Claims 450 GB data processed vs Agent2's 150 GB, and $0.90 runtime cost appears inflated compared to more realistic $0.01245-$0.06225 range. DBU cost of $0.45/hour is within reasonable range but the 2-hour runtime estimate seems excessive for the described workload."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_Comprehensive,95,Lines 8-12,"Excellent syntax and internal consistency. Provides realistic cost ranges with proper calculations (0.083 hours * $0.15-$0.75 = $0.01245-$0.06225). Data volume estimates (150 GB, 10% of 1.5 TB) are logical and well-reasoned. Minor deduction for some assumptions that could be better documented."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_Brief,N/A,Lines 1-10,"Improve cost calculation accuracy by researching current DBU rates and realistic runtime estimates. Add detailed breakdown of effort components. Include cost ranges rather than single point estimates. Provide better justification for data volume and processing time assumptions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Minor improvements: Add uncertainty ranges for effort estimates, include potential risks or variables that could affect costs, and consider adding comparison with industry benchmarks. The detailed approach and thorough documentation are exemplary."
