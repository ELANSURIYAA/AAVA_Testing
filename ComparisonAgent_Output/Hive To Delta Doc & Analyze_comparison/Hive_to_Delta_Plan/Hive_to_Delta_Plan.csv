Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-25,"Both outputs address Hive to Delta migration cost estimation but with significantly different approaches and levels of detail. Agent1_CostEstimate provides a concise summary with higher cost estimates, while Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate delivers a detailed analysis with lower cost ranges and more thorough methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,1-25,"Both outputs share the same core intent of estimating costs and effort for Hive to Delta migration. However, they differ significantly in cost calculations (Agent1: $0.90 vs Agent2: $0.01245-$0.06225), effort estimates (Agent1: 9 hours vs Agent2: 12 hours), and API costs (Agent1: 0.0012 vs Agent2: 0.00020). The semantic alignment is good but with notable divergence in specific values and methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,1-25,"Agent1_CostEstimate follows a simple 3-section structure (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing, API Cost) while Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate uses a more elaborate structure with subsections, detailed breakdowns, summary tables, and comprehensive documentation. Both follow logical flow but with different levels of granularity and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1_CostEstimate,95,1-12,"Agent1 output is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent structure, and no broken references. Minor issue: lacks detailed justification for some cost calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,98,1-25,"Agent2 output is highly correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, detailed calculations, and comprehensive structure. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in some bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,1-25,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs are well-formed with proper syntax and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1_CostEstimate,,3-12,"Consider providing more detailed cost breakdowns and justifications similar to Agent2. Include range estimates rather than single point values to account for variability in DBU costs and execution times."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2_ComprehensiveEstimate,,1-25,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding executive summary section for quick reference. Minor formatting consistency improvements needed in bullet point structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-25,"Reconcile the significant differences in cost estimates through standardized assumptions about data volume, processing complexity, and DBU rates. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent1's conciseness with Agent2's thoroughness."
