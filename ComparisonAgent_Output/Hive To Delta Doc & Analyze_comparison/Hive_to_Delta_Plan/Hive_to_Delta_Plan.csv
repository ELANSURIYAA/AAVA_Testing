Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide cost and effort estimates for Hive to Delta migration testing, but with significant differences in depth, accuracy, and methodology. Agent 2 delivers a comprehensive analysis with detailed reasoning, while Agent 1 provides basic estimates with limited justification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Hive to Delta migration testing. They cover similar aspects: runtime costs, manual fixes, testing effort, and API costs. However, they differ significantly in their approach to cost calculation and effort estimation methodology. Agent 1 uses simplified assumptions while Agent 2 provides detailed environment-specific calculations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,All,"Both outputs follow a similar high-level structure with numbered sections for cost estimation and effort estimation. However, Agent 2 includes additional subsections (2.2, 2.3), summary tables, and comprehensive documentation that Agent 1 lacks. Agent 1 uses a flat structure while Agent 2 employs hierarchical organization with detailed breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Basic_Cost_Agent,85,Lines 3-6,"Syntax is correct but contains questionable assumptions. Runtime estimation of 2 hours for 450 GB seems high, and the fixed DBU cost of $0.45/hour may not reflect actual Databricks pricing tiers."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Analysis_Agent,95,Lines 8-12,"Excellent syntax and structure. Provides realistic cost ranges ($0.15-$0.75 per DBU hour) and accurate runtime estimates (5 minutes for the query complexity). Minor deduction for some formatting inconsistencies in the summary table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,All,"Average correctness score. Both outputs are syntactically sound, but Agent 2 demonstrates superior accuracy in cost modeling and effort estimation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Basic_Cost_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-15,"Consider adopting more detailed cost modeling approaches, including environment-specific DBU pricing and realistic runtime estimates based on query complexity rather than data volume alone."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Comprehensive_Analysis_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-85,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider standardizing the summary table format and ensuring consistent decimal precision across all cost estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Agent 2's methodology should be adopted as the standard approach for migration cost estimation. Agent 1's simplicity could be useful for quick estimates but requires calibration against more accurate models."
