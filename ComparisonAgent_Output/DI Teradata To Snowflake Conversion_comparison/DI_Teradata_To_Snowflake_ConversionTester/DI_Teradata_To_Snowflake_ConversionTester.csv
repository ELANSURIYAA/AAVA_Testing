Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs are comprehensive pytest scripts for Snowflake SQL validation with similar core functionality but different scope and focus. Agent 1 provides 8 focused test cases for basic employee backup operations, while Agent 2 offers 12 test cases with additional Teradata-to-Snowflake migration considerations including BTEQ command validation and Snowflake-specific features."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs address Snowflake SQL testing for employee backup operations with similar core logic (table creation, data insertion via joins, edge case handling). Agent 2 extends the scope to include migration-specific concerns like BTEQ command removal and RBAC testing. The fundamental intent and approach are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-200","Both follow pytest structure with fixtures, setup/teardown, and test functions. Agent 1 uses simpler fixture naming (cleanup_tables vs setup_and_teardown) and inline SQL execution, while Agent 2 introduces helper functions (create_tables, run_main_sql, fetch_all) for better code organization. Test naming conventions differ slightly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 45-50, 85-90","Minor issues: Missing warehouse parameter in connection (line 45), some hardcoded string comparisons that could be more robust (lines 85-90). Overall syntax is valid and logic is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 40-45, 120-125, 180-185","Issues include: Missing error handling for unauthorized user connection (lines 180-185), potential race conditions in performance test timing (lines 120-125), and some placeholder comments for manual verification (lines 40-45). Syntax is valid but some test implementations are incomplete."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with valid Python and SQL syntax. Minor implementation gaps and edge case handling issues prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 45, 85-90","Add warehouse parameter to Snowflake connection for completeness. Enhance string comparison assertions with more flexible matching to handle potential whitespace or formatting differences."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 120-125, 180-185","Implement proper error handling for RBAC test scenarios. Add more robust timing mechanisms for performance tests. Complete placeholder implementations for query profiler validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Consider standardizing fixture naming conventions and helper function patterns. Both could benefit from parameterized tests for better coverage of edge cases. Add logging for better debugging during test execution."
