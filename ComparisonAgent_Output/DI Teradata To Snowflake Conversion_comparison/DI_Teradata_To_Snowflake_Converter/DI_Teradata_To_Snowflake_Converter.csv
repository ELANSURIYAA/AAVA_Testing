Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs successfully convert Teradata employee backup logic to Snowflake SQL. Agent 2 provides more robust implementation with better error handling and cleaner syntax. Key differences: Agent 2 uses VARCHAR instead of CHAR, includes DROP TABLE IF EXISTS for safety, uses CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE, and provides more comprehensive documentation. Both maintain semantic equivalence in core functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-30 (both agents)","Both outputs achieve the same core objective of creating an employee backup table and inserting data from Employee and Salary tables. The semantic intent is nearly identical - both create the same table structure, perform the same INNER JOIN operation, and select the same columns. Minor semantic differences include Agent 2's more defensive programming approach with table dropping and replacement, and slightly different data type choices (VARCHAR vs CHAR). The final SELECT from EmployeeSample is present in Agent 1 but noted as optional orchestration in Agent 2."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 8-25 (Agent 1), Lines 8-28 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar structural flow: table creation, data insertion via JOIN, and additional operations. Agent 2 has enhanced structure with explicit DROP TABLE before creation, uses CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE syntax, and includes explicit column listing in INSERT statement. Agent 1 has simpler linear structure while Agent 2 shows more defensive programming patterns. Both use identical JOIN logic and column selection patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 6, 13","Agent 1 syntax is valid Snowflake SQL with minor considerations: CHAR(30) is valid but VARCHAR is more commonly used in Snowflake. The commented DROP TABLE statement is syntactically correct. All table references, column names, and JOIN syntax are properly formed. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 8-28","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent Snowflake SQL syntax with best practices: proper use of DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE syntax, VARCHAR data types appropriate for Snowflake, explicit column listing in INSERT statement, and comprehensive commenting. All SQL constructs are syntactically correct and follow Snowflake conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness. Agent 2 slightly edges ahead with more idiomatic Snowflake syntax and better defensive programming practices. No critical syntax errors in either output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider using VARCHAR instead of CHAR for better Snowflake performance. Implement the commented DROP TABLE IF EXISTS for safer execution. Add explicit column listing in INSERT statements for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent implementation following Snowflake best practices. Consider adding transaction control or error handling for production use. The approach of noting external orchestration needs is commendable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs successfully achieve the conversion objective. Agent 2 provides a more production-ready solution with better error handling and Snowflake-specific optimizations. For enterprise deployment, consider Agent 2's approach as the preferred implementation."
