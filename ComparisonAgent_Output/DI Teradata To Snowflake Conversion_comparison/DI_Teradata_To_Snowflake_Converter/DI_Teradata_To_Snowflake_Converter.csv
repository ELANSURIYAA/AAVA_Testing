Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-35 (Agent 1), Lines 1-38 (Agent 2)","Both agents successfully convert Teradata employee backup logic to Snowflake SQL with high semantic alignment (88/100) and good structural similarity (85/100). Agent 2 demonstrates superior Snowflake best practices with CREATE OR REPLACE, VARCHAR usage, and explicit column lists, while Agent 1 maintains simpler approach with commented alternatives. Both outputs are syntactically correct (95/100 each) with proper SQL structure and valid Snowflake syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 8-15 (Agent 1), Lines 8-15 (Agent 2)","Both agents address the same core objective: converting Teradata employee backup logic to Snowflake. Key semantic alignment includes: (1) Creating employee_bkup table with identical column structure and data types, (2) Implementing INSERT with INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables on EmployeeNo, (3) Including comprehensive header comments with author and description. Minor semantic differences: Agent 2 adds explicit note about session control management (lines 32-34) and includes optional data validation comment (line 28), showing deeper understanding of migration considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 8-25 (Agent 1), Lines 8-31 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar logical flow: header comments, table creation, data insertion, with identical core SQL structure. Key structural similarities: (1) Same table schema definition order and column specifications, (2) Identical INSERT-SELECT with INNER JOIN pattern, (3) Consistent aliasing (a for Employee, b for Salary). Structural differences: Agent 1 uses commented DROP (line 13) vs Agent 2's active DROP IF EXISTS (line 8), Agent 2 includes explicit column list in INSERT (lines 16-22) vs Agent 1's implicit approach, and Agent 2 adds comprehensive migration notes at end."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 8-15, 17-25, 27-29","Syntactically correct Snowflake SQL with valid CREATE TABLE statement, proper column definitions (INTEGER, CHAR, SMALLINT), correct INSERT-SELECT with INNER JOIN syntax, valid table aliases, and proper SELECT statement. Minor consideration: commented DROP statement (line 13) is syntactically valid but inactive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 8-15, 16-31","Syntactically correct Snowflake SQL with valid DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE with proper column definitions using VARCHAR(30) instead of CHAR(30), correct INSERT with explicit column list, valid INNER JOIN syntax, and proper commenting. All SQL statements are well-formed and executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,"All lines both agents","Both agents produce syntactically correct Snowflake SQL with no syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references. All table names, column names, and SQL constructs are properly formed and executable."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,85,"Lines 13, 8-15","Consider using 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS' instead of commented approach for better production safety. Consider using VARCHAR instead of CHAR for variable-length string fields to optimize storage in Snowflake."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,90,"Lines 16-22, 32-34","Excellent use of Snowflake best practices including CREATE OR REPLACE, VARCHAR data types, and explicit column lists. The comprehensive migration notes demonstrate thorough understanding of Teradata to Snowflake conversion considerations."
