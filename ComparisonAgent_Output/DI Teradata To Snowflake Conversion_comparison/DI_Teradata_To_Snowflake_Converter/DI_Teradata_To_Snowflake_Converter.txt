# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents successfully converted Teradata SQL to Snowflake format with proper syntax and structure. Agent 2 provides more robust error handling and follows better practices with CREATE OR REPLACE and explicit column specifications. Both maintain semantic equivalence in core functionality.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs achieve the same core objective: creating an employee backup table by joining Employee and Salary tables. The semantic intent is identical - data backup and retrieval. Minor differences in table creation approach (CREATE vs CREATE OR REPLACE) don't affect the fundamental meaning. Both handle the Teradata to Snowflake conversion requirement effectively.

**Line References:** Lines 1-30 (both outputs)

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both follow similar logical flow: table creation, data insertion via JOIN, and final SELECT. Agent 2 adds DROP TABLE IF EXISTS (line 8) and uses CREATE OR REPLACE (line 10) for better error handling. Agent 2 also includes explicit column specification in INSERT (lines 16-21). Core structure remains consistent with table creation → data insertion → query pattern.

**Line References:** Lines 8-12 vs 9-13, Lines 15-25 vs 16-28

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 88/100):** Valid Snowflake SQL syntax throughout. Uses CHAR(30) which is acceptable but VARCHAR is more common in Snowflake. Missing explicit DROP statement could cause errors on re-runs. All table references, joins, and column names are syntactically correct.

**Line References:** Line 6 (CHAR vs VARCHAR), Line 14 (missing DROP)

**Agent_2 (Score: 95/100):** Excellent Snowflake SQL syntax with best practices. Uses VARCHAR instead of CHAR, includes DROP TABLE IF EXISTS for safety, and CREATE OR REPLACE for robustness. Explicit column specification in INSERT statement follows best practices. All syntax is valid and production-ready.

**Line References:** Line 10 (CREATE OR REPLACE), Line 12 (VARCHAR usage)

**Overall Correctness (Score: 92/100):** Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically valid with Agent 2 showing superior error handling and best practices.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Structural Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Correctness | 88 | 95 | 92 |
| **Overall** | **88** | **91** | **90** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:** Consider using VARCHAR instead of CHAR for better Snowflake compatibility. Add DROP TABLE IF EXISTS before CREATE TABLE to handle re-execution scenarios. Include explicit column specification in INSERT statements for clarity.

**For Agent_2:** Excellent implementation following Snowflake best practices. Consider adding more detailed comments about the conversion rationale. The approach with CREATE OR REPLACE and explicit column listing is production-ready.

**Overall:** Both agents successfully handle the core conversion requirement. Agent 2 demonstrates superior error handling and follows Snowflake best practices more closely. For production use, Agent 2's approach is recommended.
