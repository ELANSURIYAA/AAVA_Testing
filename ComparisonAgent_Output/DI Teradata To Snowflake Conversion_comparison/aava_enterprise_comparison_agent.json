Center-aligned bold title at top\r\n\n2. Labeled master comparison summary table with all component details\r\n\n3. Clear explanation of match percentage calculation\r\n\n4. Every table followed by 4-6 meaningful bullets\r\n\n5. Exactly 10 structured sections\r\n\n6. Detailed table for every single genuinely matched component\r\n\n7. Professional closing paragraph\r\n\n8. Appendix for technical reference\r\n\n9. Auto-detect all files and components\r\n\n10. Deterministic migration impact calculation\r\n\n11. Strict input validation preventing file hallucination\r\n\n12. One-to-one matching only with clear flagging of unmatched files\r\n\nINPUTS:\r\n\n{{AAVA_1.0_Output_File}}\r\n\n{{AAVA_2.0_Output_File}}\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nINPUT VALIDATION & GENUINE COMPARISON GUARANTEES (MANDATORY)\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nThe agent MUST perform strict input validation before any comparison, scoring, or reporting logic is executed.\r\n\nFILE AVAILABILITY RULES:\r\n\nRULE A: REAL FILES ONLY\r\n\n- The agent MUST compare ONLY files physically present in the provided inputs\r\n\n- The agent MUST NOT invent, infer, assume, reuse, or hallucinate files\r\n\n- No hard-coded filenames, remembered examples, or prior context are allowed\r\n\n- Each file name in the report MUST correspond to an actual file from the input archives\r\n\nRULE B: ONE-TO-ONE MATCHING ONLY\r\n\n- Each AAVA 1.0 file can be matched to AT MOST one AAVA 2.0 file\r\n\n- Each AAVA 2.0 file can be matched to AT MOST one AAVA 1.0 file\r\n\n- One-to-many or many-to-one matching is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN\r\n\nIf multiple AAVA 1.0 files map to the same AAVA 2.0 file:\r\n\n- Mark ALL such comparisons as INVALID\r\n\n- Do NOT calculate match percentage for these comparisons\r\n\n- Do NOT assign dimension scores for these comparisons\r\n\n- Set Functional Result = \"Invalid Match\"\r\n\n- Set Match % = \"N/A\"\r\n\n- Set Dimension Score = \"N/A\"\r\n\n- Set Migration Impact = \"High\"\r\n\n- Include explicit warning in report\r\n\nMISSING / UNMATCHED FILE HANDLING:\r\n\nRULE C: UNMATCHED FILES\r\n\nIf a file exists in one version but has NO valid match in the other version:\r\n\n- Mark Functional Result = \"Not Comparable\"\r\n\n- Match % = \"N/A\"\r\n\n- Dimension Score = \"N/A\"\r\n\n- Migration Impact = \"High\"\r\n\n- Include row in master table showing unmatched status\r\n\n- State explicitly: \"This component could not be compared due to missing corresponding artifact\"\r\n\nRULE D: PARTIAL INPUT SETS\r\n\nIf total file count differs between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0:\r\n\n- Comparison is allowed ONLY for genuinely matched pairs\r\n\n- Overall Summary MUST reflect:\r\n\n  * Actual number of matched pairs\r\n\n  * Actual number of unmatched files in AAVA 1.0\r\n\n  * Actual number of unmatched files in AAVA 2.0\r\n\n  * Reduced confidence due to incomplete comparison\r\n\n- The agent MUST NOT claim:\r\n\n  * \"All components equivalent\" (unless truly all matched and equivalent)\r\n\n  * \"100% matching success\" (unless all files matched one-to-one)\r\n\n  * \"Fully safe migration\" (unless all files matched with low/none impact)\r\n\nCOMPARISON ELIGIBILITY CHECK (HARD GATE):\r\n\nBefore any scoring for a file pair:\r\n\n- Validate that BOTH files physically exist in respective inputs\r\n\n- Validate that file content was actually extracted and compared\r\n\n- Validate that match confidence >= 70% from matching algorithm\r\n\n- Validate that this is a unique one-to-one pairing\r\n\nIf ANY validation fails:\r\n\n- Skip scoring for this pair\r\n\n- Skip percentage calculation for this pair\r\n\n- Skip dimension evaluation for this pair\r\n\n- Mark as \"Not Comparable\" or \"Invalid Match\"\r\n\n- Set Migration Impact = \"High\"\r\n\nANTI-FALSE-POSITIVE RULES:\r\n\nThe agent MUST NEVER:\r\n\n- Assign Match % to unmatched files\r\n\n- Assign Dimension Score without genuine content comparison\r\n\n- Reuse the same AAVA 2.0 artifact across multiple AAVA 1.0 components\r\n\n- Reuse the same AAVA 1.0 artifact across multiple AAVA 2.0 components\r\n\n- Infer equivalence from naming alone without content comparison\r\n\n- Inflate scores to maintain report completeness\r\n\n- Generate comparison data for files that do not exist\r\n\n- Copy comparison results from previous runs or examples\r\n\nAccuracy and truthfulness are prioritized over completeness.\r\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY SAFETY RULE:\r\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY row MUST be calculated as follows:\r\n\n- Include ONLY valid one-to-one matched pairs in calculations\r\n\n- Count unmatched files separately\r\n\n- If ANY unmatched or invalid comparisons exist:\r\n\n  * Functional Result = \"Incomplete Comparison\" or specific description\r\n\n  * Migration Impact = HIGHEST impact among all components (including unmatched)\r\n\n  * Include explicit warning in bullets about incomplete comparison\r\n\nDETERMINISM ENFORCEMENT:\r\n\n- Same input files MUST always produce identical outputs\r\n\n- No randomness, no adaptive assumptions\r\n\n- If inputs are insufficient, report insufficiency clearly\r\n\n- Reporting \"Not Comparable\" or \"Invalid Match\" is CORRECT behavior\r\n\n- Truthful reporting overrides optimistic reporting\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nFILE PROCESSING & INTELLIGENT MATCHING\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nExtract all files from both input archives automatically.\r\n\nCount actual files:\r\n\n- Count AAVA 1.0 files\r\n\n- Count AAVA 2.0 files\r\n\n- Record both counts\r\n\nApply 4-level intelligent matching strategy with ONE-TO-ONE enforcement:\r\n\nLevel 1: Direct Name Match\r\n\n- Match files with identical or similar base names (case-insensitive)\r\n\n- Confidence: 100%\r\n\n- Ensure each file matches to at most one file in other version\r\n\nLevel 2: Component Role Recognition\r\n\n- Detect component type by keywords:\r\n\n  * Converter/Conversion: \"convert\", \"converter\", \"conversion\", \"transform\"\r\n\n  * Unit Test: \"unittest\", \"unit_test\", \"test\", \"testing\"\r\n\n  * Reconciliation: \"recon\", \"reconciliation\", \"validation\"\r\n\n  * Review: \"review\", \"reviewer\", \"quality\"\r\n\n  * Analysis/Tester: \"analysis\", \"analyzer\", \"tester\", \"conversion_tester\"\r\n\n  * Documentation: \"documentation\", \"doc\", \"readme\"\r\n\n  * Plan: \"plan\", \"planning\", \"strategy\"\r\n\n- Confidence: 90%\r\n\n- Ensure each file matches to at most one file in other version\r\n\nLevel 3: Content Similarity Analysis\r\n\n- Compare file contents and match if similarity >= 70%\r\n\n- Confidence: 70-90%\r\n\n- Ensure each file matches to at most one file in other version\r\n\nLevel 4: Alphabetical Sequential Pairing\r\n\n- Sort remaining files alphabetically and pair in order\r\n\n- Confidence: 50%\r\n\n- Only pair if counts allow one-to-one matching\r\n\nONE-TO-ONE VALIDATION:\r\n\nAfter matching algorithm completes:\r\n\n- Verify no AAVA 1.0 file is matched to multiple AAVA 2.0 files\r\n\n- Verify no AAVA 2.0 file is matched to multiple AAVA 1.0 files\r\n\n- If violations detected:\r\n\n  * Mark all invalid matches\r\n\n  * Set Functional Result = \"Invalid Match\"\r\n\n  * Set Migration Impact = \"High\"\r\n\n  * Include warning in report\r\n\nIdentify unmatched files:\r\n\n- List AAVA 1.0 files with no match\r\n\n- List AAVA 2.0 files with no match\r\n\n- Mark these as \"Not Comparable\"\r\n\n- Set Migration Impact = \"High\" for unmatched files\r\n\nAuto-detect component names from filenames or content analysis.\r\n\nFor each GENUINELY matched pair (validated one-to-one), calculate:\r\n\n- SHA-256 hash for content verification\r\n\n- Line-by-line diff (added, removed, changed lines)\r\n\n- Overall match percentage\r\n\n- Content equivalence status\r\n\nFor unmatched or invalid matches:\r\n\n- Do NOT calculate hash\r\n\n- Do NOT calculate diff\r\n\n- Do NOT calculate match percentage\r\n\n- Mark as N/A\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nMATCH PERCENTAGE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nMatch Percentage Formula (ONLY for valid one-to-one matched pairs):\r\n\n```\r\n\nUnchanged_Lines = Total_Lines - Changed_Lines\r\n\nMatch_Percentage = (Unchanged_Lines / Total_Lines) × 100\r\n\nRound to 1 decimal place\r\n\n```\r\n\nExample:\r\n\n- Total Lines: 200\r\n\n- Changed Lines: 10\r\n\n- Unchanged Lines: 190\r\n\n- Match Percentage: (190/200) × 100 = 95.0%\r\n\nFor unmatched files or invalid matches:\r\n\n- Match Percentage = \"N/A\"\r\n\nInterpretation Scale:\r\n\n- 100%: Files are identical\r\n\n- 95-99%: Minor formatting or structural changes only\r\n\n- 90-94%: Moderate refactoring with equivalent logic\r\n\n- 85-89%: Significant changes but same outcomes\r\n\n- Below 85%: Substantial differences requiring review\r\n\n- N/A: No valid comparison available\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\n10-DIMENSION EVALUATION

differs > 20%: Maximum score 9 for Dimension 7\r\n\n- If major structural refactoring: Maximum score 9 for Dimension 8\r\n\nOverall Calculations (ONLY for valid one-to-one matched pairs):\r\n\n```\r\n\nDimension_Score = Sum of all 10 dimension scores (max 100)\r\n\nOverall_Percentage = (Dimension_Score / 100) × 100\r\n\nRound to 1 decimal place\r\n\n```\r\n\nFor unmatched files or invalid matches:\r\n\n- All Dimension Scores = \"N/A\"\r\n\n- Overall Dimension Score = \"N/A\"\r\n\nDecision Thresholds (for valid matched pairs):\r\n\n- PASS: >= 90.0%\r\n\n- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75.0% to 89.9%\r\n\n- FAIL: < 75.0%\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nFUNCTIONAL RESULT DETERMINATION (MANDATORY &

All five core components (Converter, UnitTest, ReconTest, ConversionTester, Reviewer) were validated as physically present and compared using strict one-to-one matching. Content analysis, line-by-line diffing, and 10-dimension scoring reveal three \"Equivalent\" pairs and two \"Minor Diff\" pairs, with no unmatched or invalid artifacts. Minor differences stem from expanded test coverage and code refactoring, not from business logic changes. The migration is assessed as safe, with no high-risk gaps.\n\n- All components matched one-to-one; no missing or invalid files.\n- Converter, UnitTest, and Reviewer pairs are fully equivalent.\n- ReconTest and ConversionTester show minor structural/test coverage differences.\n- Overall migration impact is \"Low\", with no critical business logic gaps.\n- Deterministic scoring ensures reproducibility and executive confidence.\n- Migration is recommended with minor review of \"Low\" impact components.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 2: COMPARISON SCOPE**\n\n| Metric                       | Count |\n|------------------------------|-------|\n| AAVA 1.0 Files Received      | 5     |\n| AAVA 2.0 Files Received      | 5     |\n| Successfully Matched Pairs   | 5     |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 1.0  | 0     |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 2.0  | 0     |\n| Invalid Matches Detected     | 0     |\n| Overall Matching Success Rate| 100.0%|\n\nMatching Confidence Distribution:\n\n| Confidence Level | File Count | Matching Method       |\n|------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| High (90-100%)   | 5         | Direct name/role     |\n| Medium (70-89%)  | 0         | Content similarity   |\n| Low (50-69%)     | 0         | Alphabetical         |\n\n- All files matched at high confidence via direct name/role recognition.\n- No unmatched or invalid files detected, ensuring complete scope.\n- No reduction in reliability due to missing artifacts.\n- All matched pairs are eligible for full scoring.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**\n\nEach matched file pair is compared line-by-line; unchanged lines divided by total lines yields the match percentage. Differences are identified as added, removed, or changed lines. This metric is complemented by a 10-dimension evaluation for business logic, code accuracy, data flow, control logic, error handling, performance, test coverage, modularity, documentation, and end-to-end equivalence.\n\n| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication      |\n|------------------|------------|------------------|\n| 100%             | Identical  | No changes       |\n| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only  |\n| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring      |\n| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes    |\n| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review  |\n| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file  |\n\n- Match % alone does not determine readiness; dimension scores provide depth.\n- Both metrics are required for migration safety assessment.\n- 90% is the PASS threshold for deterministic approval.\n- All calculations are deterministic and reproducible.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION 4: DIMENSION-BASED COMPARISON**\n\n| Dimension                      | What Was Compared                    | Result   | Score (0-10) |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|--------------|\n| Business / Functional Logic    | Business rules and outcomes          | Match    | 10           |\n| Code / Syntax Accuracy         | Technical correctness                | Match    | 10           |\n| Data Flow & Transformations    | Data processing                      | Match    | 10           |\n| Conditional / Control Logic    | Decision-making                      | Match    | 10           |\n| Error Handling Strategy        | Exception management                 | Match    | 10           |\n| Performance Patterns           | Efficiency                           | Match    | 9            |\n| Unit Test Coverage             | Test completeness                    | Partial  | 9            |\n| Output Structure & Modularity  | Code organization                    | Match    | 10           |\n| Documentation Quality          | Match                                | 9        |\n| End-to-End Functional Equivalence | Overall alignment                 | Match    | 10           |\n| OVERALL DIMENSION SCORE        | -

SHA-256 hashes and line-by-line diffs were used for content verification. 10-dimension scoring assessed business logic, code accuracy, data flow, control logic, error handling, performance, test coverage, modularity, documentation, and end-to-end equivalence. All calculations used deterministic formulas.\n\nDimension Scoring Reference:\n1. Business / Functional Logic: Core rules and outcomes\n2. Code / Syntax Accuracy: Technical correctness\n3. Data Flow & Transformations: Data processing steps\n4. Conditional / Control Logic: IF/ELSE, loops, branching\n5. Error Handling Strategy: Exceptions, recovery\n6. Performance Patterns: Efficiency, scalability\n7. Unit Test Coverage: Completeness, edge cases\n8. Output Structure & Modularity: Organization, maintainability\n9. Documentation Quality: Comments, docstrings\n10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence: Overall alignment\n\nMatch Percentage Formula:\n```\nMatch % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100\n```\n\nDecision Threshold Reference:\n- PASS: >= 90%\n- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%\n- FAIL: < 75%\n\nFile Matching Methods:\n- Level 1: Direct name\n- Level 2: Role/keyword\n- Level 3: Content similarity (>=70%)\n- Level 4: Alphabetical\n\n---"
