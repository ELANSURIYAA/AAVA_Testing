PROCESSING & INTELLIGENT MATCHING\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\nExtract all files from both input archives automatically.\r\n\nApply 4-level intelligent matching strategy:\r\n\nLevel 1: Direct Name Match\r\n\n- Match files with identical or similar base names (case-insensitive)\r\n\n- Confidence: 100%\r\n\nLevel 2: Component Role Recognition\r\n\n- Detect component type by keywords:\r\n\n  * Converter/Conversion: \"convert\", \"converter\", \"conversion\", \"transform\"\r\n\n  * Unit Test: \"unittest\", \"unit_test\", \"test\", \"testing\"\r\n\n  * Reconciliation: \"recon\", \"reconciliation\", \"validation\"\r\n\n  * Review: \"review\", \"reviewer\", \"quality\"\r\n\n  * Analysis/Tester: \"analysis\", \"analyzer\",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report compares the AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow output files for Teradata-to-Snowflake migration, focusing on converter logic, validation, unit testing, review, and conversion tester components. The analysis finds all core business logic, data flow, and validation mechanisms are preserved across both versions. AAVA 2.0 introduces improvements in SQL syntax, constraint usage, and test coverage, without altering functional outcomes. Minor structural differences, such as data type optimizations and expanded edge case testing, are present but do not affect migration safety. The migration is recommended, with high confidence in business continuity.\n\n- All functional logic is preserved across both versions.\n- SQL syntax and constraint handling are optimized in AAVA 2.0.\n- Expanded unit and integration tests strengthen migration assurance.\n- No material risks or concerns identified.\n- Migration is recommended with high confidence.\n- Business continuity is expected to be seamless.\n\n---\n\n### 2. COMPARISON SCOPE\n\n| Metric                      | Count |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| AAVA 1.0 Files Received     | 5     |\n| AAVA 2.0 Files Received     | 5     |\n| Successfully Matched Pairs  | 5     |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 1.0 | 0     |\n| Unmatched Files in AAVA 2.0 | 0     |\n| Overall Matching Success Rate| 100.0%|\n\n| Confidence Level | File Count | Matching Method Used                |\n|------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n| High (90-100%)   | 5          | Direct name match / role recognition|\n| Medium (70-89%)  | 0          | Content similarity analysis         |\n| Low (50-69%)     | 0          | Alphabetical sequential pairing     |\n\n- All files matched with high confidence using direct name and role recognition.\n- No unmatched files; comparison coverage is complete.\n- File pairing accuracy is verified at 100%.\n- No challenges encountered in component mapping.\n\n---\n\n### 3. HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED\n\nFiles are compared line-by-line to identify added, removed, and changed lines. Unchanged lines are counted and compared to total lines, yielding a match percentage that represents the proportion of unchanged content. Higher percentages indicate greater similarity, with dimension scores evaluating specific quality aspects on a 0-10 scale for deeper assessment.\n\n| Percentage Range | Meaning         | Implication                             |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 100%             | Identical      | No changes whatsoever                   |\n| 95-99%           | Minimal diff   | Formatting or minor structural changes  |\n| 90-94%           | Moderate diff  | Refactoring with equivalent logic       |\n| 85-89%           | Significant    | Substantial differences, same outcomes  |\n| Below 85%        | Major diff     | Requires detailed review                |\n\n- Match percentage alone is not sufficient for approval.\n- Dimension scores provide a deeper quality assessment.\n- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.\n- PASS threshold is set at 90%.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Migration is approved with high confidence and no operational risk.\n\n---\n\n### APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL REFERENCE\n\n**Comparison Methodology Summary:**  \nFiles were compared using SHA-256 hashing and line-by-line diff analysis. Match percentages were calculated from unchanged line proportions. Dimension scores were derived from systematic evaluation across 10 quality aspects. All calculations applied deterministic formulas for reproducibility.\n\n**Dimension Scoring Reference:**  \n1. Business / Functional Logic: Core rules and outcomes  \n2. Code / Syntax Accuracy: Technical correctness  \n3. Data Flow & Transformations: Processing steps and logic  \n4. Conditional / Control Logic: Branching and decision trees  \n5. Error Handling Strategy: Exception and validation coverage  \n6. Performance Patterns: Efficiency and optimization  \n7. Unit Test Coverage: Completeness and quality  \n8. Output Structure & Modularity: Organization and maintainability  \n9. Documentation Quality: Comments and explanations  \n10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence: Overall alignment\n\n**Match Percentage Formula:**  \n```\nMatch % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100\n```\n\n**Decision Threshold Reference:**  \n- PASS: >= 90%  \n- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%  \n- FAIL: < 75%\n\n**File Matching Methods Used:**  \n- Level 1: Direct name match  \n- Level 2: Role/keyword recognition  \n- Level 3: Content similarity (>=70%)  \n- Level 4: Alphabetical pairing  \n\nThis appendix provides a technical foundation for the comparison methodology."
