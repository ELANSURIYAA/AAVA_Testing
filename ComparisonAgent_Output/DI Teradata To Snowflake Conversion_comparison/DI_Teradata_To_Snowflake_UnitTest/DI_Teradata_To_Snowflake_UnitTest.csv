Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-195,"Both outputs are comprehensive pytest scripts for Snowflake SQL validation with similar core functionality but notable differences in structure, test coverage, and implementation approach. Agent 1 provides 8 test cases with more detailed error handling while Agent 2 offers 7 test cases with cleaner modular design."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-195,"Both scripts address the same core objective of validating Snowflake employee backup table operations. They cover similar test scenarios including table creation, data insertion via joins, NULL handling, and edge cases. Minor differences in test case naming and some additional scenarios in Agent 1 (like EmployeeSample table testing) create slight semantic divergence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-195,"Both follow pytest structure with fixtures and test functions, but differ significantly in organization. Agent 1 uses a cleanup_tables fixture (lines 25-38) while Agent 2 uses setup_and_teardown (lines 23-33). Agent 2 introduces helper functions create_tables(), run_main_sql(), and fetch_all() (lines 35-65) for better modularity, while Agent 1 embeds SQL directly in test functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,1-195,"Agent 1 syntax is correct with proper pytest structure, valid SQL statements, and appropriate assertions. Minor issue: missing warehouse parameter in connection (line 13) which may cause connection failures in some Snowflake environments."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,1-195,"Agent 2 syntax is excellent with proper pytest structure, valid SQL, modular helper functions, and comprehensive connection parameters including warehouse (line 12). All SQL statements are syntactically correct and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both scripts demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python and SQL syntax. Agent 2 slightly superior due to more complete connection configuration and better code organization."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,13,"Add warehouse parameter to Snowflake connection configuration for better compatibility across environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,35-65,"Consider adding more comprehensive error handling scenarios similar to Agent 1's test_insert_with_unexpected_types for complete edge case coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-195,"Both scripts would benefit from parameterized tests for better test data management and more comprehensive data type validation scenarios."
