Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produced comprehensive Pytest scripts for Snowflake SQL validation with high semantic alignment (88/100) and good structural similarity (82/100). Agent 1 scored 92/100 for correctness while Agent 2 scored 95/100, resulting in an overall average of 93.5/100. Key differences include Agent 2's superior resource management and helper function organization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"","Both outputs target identical core functionality: validating Snowflake SQL operations for employee backup table creation and data manipulation. They share common test scenarios including join operations, NULL value handling, empty table scenarios, and edge cases. Minor divergence in test case organization and specific validation approaches, but overall intent and coverage are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"","Both follow standard Pytest structure with module-scoped fixtures, autouse cleanup fixtures, and individual test functions. Agent 1 uses inline SQL execution within each test (lines 45-180), while Agent 2 employs helper functions create_tables(), run_main_sql(), and fetch_all() (lines 45-75) for better code organization. Both use similar fixture patterns but Agent 2 demonstrates superior modularity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 47, 67, 87, 107, 127, 147, 167, 187","Minor cursor resource management issues where cursor.close() is called in each test function, but the cursor is created from the connection fixture. This could lead to resource leaks. Otherwise, syntax is valid with proper Pytest decorators, fixture usage, and SQL statements."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Line 43","Excellent syntax and structure with proper resource management. Uses helper functions effectively and maintains clean separation of concerns. Minor issue: missing warehouse parameter documentation in connection fixture, but this doesn't affect functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93.5,"","Average of individual agent correctness scores (92 + 95) / 2 = 93.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 47, 67, 87, 107, 127, 147, 167, 187","Improve cursor resource management by removing cursor.close() calls in individual test functions since cursors are derived from the fixture connection. Consider adopting helper functions similar to Agent 2 for better code organization and maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Line 43","Document the warehouse parameter in the connection fixture for clarity. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling test cases similar to Agent 1's TC008 for unexpected data types."
