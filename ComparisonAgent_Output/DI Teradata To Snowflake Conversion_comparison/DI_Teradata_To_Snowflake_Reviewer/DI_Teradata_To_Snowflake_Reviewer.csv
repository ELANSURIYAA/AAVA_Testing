Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50, Lines 1-45","Both outputs provide comprehensive Teradata-to-Snowflake conversion reviews with similar analytical depth. Ascendion_AVA+ focuses on business logic preservation and optimization suggestions, while DI_Teradata_To_Snowflake_Reviewer emphasizes orchestration requirements and cost efficiency. Both identify key conversion challenges including session management, error handling, and Snowflake-specific optimizations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 5-15, Lines 8-18","Both outputs address the same core conversion task with aligned understanding of Teradata-to-Snowflake migration challenges. Key semantic alignment includes: table creation accuracy, join logic preservation, session management limitations, and optimization needs. Minor divergence in emphasis - Ascendion_AVA+ focuses more on business logic preservation while DI_Teradata_To_Snowflake_Reviewer emphasizes orchestration requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50, Lines 1-45","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost Analysis. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Minor structural differences in metadata format and subsection emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+,95,"Lines 1-5, Lines 20-25","Proper metadata format with complete header structure. All technical details are accurate including data type mappings, join logic analysis, and Snowflake limitations. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet points."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Teradata_To_Snowflake_Reviewer,90,"Lines 1-8, Lines 35-40","Metadata format differs from specified requirements but content is accurate. Technical analysis is sound with correct identification of conversion challenges. Some inconsistency in data type discussion (CHAR vs VARCHAR)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minor formatting and consistency issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+,,"Lines 40-50","Strengthen orchestration discussion to match industry best practices. Consider adding more specific Snowflake cost optimization strategies. Enhance error handling recommendations with concrete implementation examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Teradata_To_Snowflake_Reviewer,,"Lines 35-45","Standardize metadata format to match organizational requirements. Clarify data type mapping discussions for consistency. Add more specific business logic preservation examples to balance technical focus."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized metadata formatting, 2) More specific implementation examples for orchestration solutions, 3) Enhanced cost-benefit analysis for optimization recommendations, 4) Clearer distinction between mandatory vs. optional conversion elements."
