Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1_Output), Lines 1-55 (Agent_2_Output)","Both outputs provide comprehensive Teradata-to-Snowflake conversion reviews with similar structural approaches and semantic goals. Agent_1_Output focuses on business logic preservation and testing coverage, while Agent_2_Output emphasizes orchestration requirements and cloud-native optimization. Both identify key conversion challenges including session management, error handling, and Snowflake-specific optimizations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 5-15 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Teradata-to-Snowflake SQL conversion accuracy. They share similar conclusions about successful business logic replication, omission of Teradata-specific commands, and need for external orchestration. However, Agent_1_Output emphasizes testing and validation more heavily (lines 15-20), while Agent_2_Output focuses more on orchestration and cloud-native features (lines 20-30). The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor emphasis differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1_Output), Lines 1-55 (Agent_2_Output)","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural patterns with 7 numbered sections: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost Analysis. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Minor structural differences include Agent_2_Output having slightly more detailed subsection breakdowns in sections 3 and 4 (lines 25-35), and different metadata header formats (lines 1-5)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,"Lines 1-3, 45-47","Markdown syntax is correct throughout. Minor issue: metadata header uses non-standard format with incomplete 'Created on:' field (line 3). All section headers, bullet points, and formatting are syntactically valid. Internal references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,"Lines 1-8, 50-52","Markdown syntax is generally correct. Issues include: incomplete metadata requirements section at the beginning (lines 1-8) that appears to be instructional rather than content, and some inconsistent formatting in the API cost section (line 52). All other markdown elements are syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent scores (98 + 95) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Lines 40-45","Strengthen the incomplete metadata header by adding the creation date. Consider standardizing the testing coverage discussion to match the depth of analysis in other sections. The output demonstrates strong technical accuracy and comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Lines 1-8, 50-55","Remove or properly integrate the instructional metadata requirements section at the beginning, as it appears to be template content rather than review content. Standardize the API cost analysis format to match the professional tone of other sections. Consider expanding the orchestration discussion with more specific implementation details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 20-35 (both outputs)","Both outputs would benefit from more specific line-by-line code comparisons and concrete examples of the Teradata-to-Snowflake transformations being reviewed. Consider adding quantitative metrics for conversion accuracy and including specific performance benchmarks for the optimization suggestions."
