Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-300 (Agent_1), Lines 1-250 (Agent_2)","Both agents deliver comprehensive Teradata to Snowflake migration validation scripts with strong semantic alignment (88/100) and good structural similarity (82/100). Agent_1 provides more robust enterprise-grade features including batch processing, progress tracking, and extensive error handling, while Agent_2 offers a more streamlined approach with cleaner code organization. Correctness scores are high for both (Agent_1: 92/100, Agent_2: 95/100) with minor issues in variable handling and exception management."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (both agents)","Both scripts address identical core requirements: Teradata-to-Snowflake migration validation with data export, transfer, comparison, and reporting. Agent_1 implements more comprehensive enterprise features (batch processing, progress tracking, detailed logging) while Agent_2 focuses on essential functionality with cleaner implementation. Both handle the same SQL operations, connection management, and validation workflows. Minor semantic differences in error handling philosophy and reporting detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 60-120 (Agent_1), Lines 40-80 (Agent_2)","Both follow similar high-level architecture: imports, configuration, connection functions, data processing, comparison, and reporting. Agent_1 uses more granular function decomposition with specialized utilities (parse_sql_tables, safe_execute, export_table_to_csv) while Agent_2 employs broader function scopes. Control flow differs: Agent_1 uses batch processing loops and progress tracking, Agent_2 uses direct processing. Both implement similar exception handling patterns but with different granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-20, 85-90, 180-185","Strong syntax correctness with proper imports, function definitions, and control structures. Minor issues: Line 15 - LOG_FILE and REPORT_FILE definitions could benefit from path validation. Line 85-90 - Batch processing logic assumes cursor.fetchall() behavior that may vary. Line 180-185 - Exception handling in transfer_parquet_to_snowflake_stage could be more specific. Overall excellent code structure with comprehensive error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 25-30, 120-125","Excellent syntax correctness with clean imports, proper function definitions, and consistent error handling. Minor issues: Line 25-30 - Environment variable handling could include more validation. Line 120-125 - DataFrame comparison logic assumes consistent column ordering. Very clean code structure with appropriate exception handling and logging integration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both demonstrate strong Python syntax adherence, proper import usage, and sound programming practices. Agent_2 slightly edges out with cleaner variable handling and more consistent error management patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,87,"Lines 85-120, 200-220","Enhance batch processing error recovery mechanisms and add more granular progress checkpoints. Consider implementing connection pooling for better resource management. Add input validation for environment variables and file paths."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,88,"Lines 80-100, 180-200","Add batch processing capabilities for large datasets and implement progress tracking. Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging purposes. Enhance error messages with more context for troubleshooting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,88,,"Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Configuration file support for better deployment flexibility, 2) Unit test coverage for critical functions, 3) Docker containerization for consistent deployment, 4) Enhanced security with credential encryption, 5) Performance optimization for large-scale data processing."
