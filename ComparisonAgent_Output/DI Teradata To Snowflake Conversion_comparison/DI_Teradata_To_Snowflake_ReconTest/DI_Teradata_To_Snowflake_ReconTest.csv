Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300+","Both agents provide comprehensive Python scripts for Teradata to Snowflake migration validation with data export, transfer, comparison, and reporting capabilities. Agent 1 offers more robust error handling, batch processing, and detailed logging, while Agent 2 provides a more streamlined approach with cleaner code organization and better separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 250-300","Both scripts address the same core objective of validating Teradata to Snowflake migration through data export, transfer, and comparison. They implement similar workflows: connect to both databases, export Teradata data to Parquet, transfer to Snowflake stage, create external tables, execute SQL logic, and compare results. Minor differences in approach to batch processing and error handling reduce semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-30, 80-120, 200-250","Both scripts follow similar high-level structure with imports, configuration, connection functions, data export/transfer functions, comparison logic, and main execution flow. Agent 1 uses more granular function decomposition with specialized utilities like parse_sql_tables() and batch processing loops. Agent 2 employs cleaner separation with distinct sections for Teradata, Snowflake, and comparison functions. Different approaches to error handling and logging reduce structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,88,"Lines 45-50, 120-125, 180-185","Generally well-formed Python with proper imports and function definitions. Issues: Line 45 has potential undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' in function names, Line 120 uses string concatenation in SQL which could be vulnerable, Line 180 has inconsistent error handling patterns. Most syntax is valid but some variable naming and SQL construction patterns need improvement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 25-30, 95-100, 150-155","Cleaner Python syntax with better variable naming and consistent patterns. Issues: Line 25 has potential issue with environment variable handling without proper validation, Line 95 could benefit from parameterized queries, Line 150 has minor inconsistency in exception handling. Overall more syntactically correct and follows Python best practices better than Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores (88 + 92) / 2 = 90. Both scripts are syntactically sound with minor issues in variable handling, SQL construction, and error handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 45, 120, 180","Fix variable naming issues with 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' in function names, implement parameterized queries instead of string concatenation for SQL construction, standardize error handling patterns throughout the script, and improve batch processing error recovery mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 25, 95, 150","Add comprehensive environment variable validation with clear error messages, implement parameterized queries for all SQL operations, enhance exception handling consistency across all functions, and add more detailed logging for debugging purposes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"General","Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Implementing comprehensive input validation and sanitization, 2) Adding unit tests for critical functions, 3) Improving documentation with docstrings, 4) Implementing retry mechanisms for database operations, 5) Adding configuration file support instead of hardcoded values, 6) Implementing proper connection pooling for better resource management."
