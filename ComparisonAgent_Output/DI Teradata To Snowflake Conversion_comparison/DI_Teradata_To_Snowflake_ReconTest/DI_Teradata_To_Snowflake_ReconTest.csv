Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-450 (Agent 1), Lines 1-250 (Agent 2)","Both agents implement Teradata to Snowflake migration validation with Python scripts. Agent 1 provides comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with batch processing, detailed logging, SQL parsing, and extensive error handling. Agent 2 offers streamlined approach focusing on core workflow. Both achieve same functional goals but differ significantly in implementation depth and production readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 401-450 vs Lines 171-250","Both scripts accomplish identical migration validation objectives: connect to Teradata, export data, transfer to Snowflake, execute SQL, and compare results. Core workflow logic is semantically equivalent. Agent 1 includes additional features like batch processing (lines 161-200), SQL parsing (lines 71-100), and detailed reporting (lines 371-400) that enhance but don't change core intent. Minor semantic differences in error handling approaches and comparison methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-450 vs Lines 1-250","Structural organization differs significantly. Agent 1 uses modular function-based architecture with 15+ specialized functions, extensive configuration (lines 16-25), and comprehensive logging setup (lines 26-40). Agent 2 employs simpler linear structure with 8 main functions and minimal configuration (lines 11-25). Both follow similar high-level flow but Agent 1 has more sophisticated decomposition with batch processing, SQL parsing, and detailed comparison logic. Function naming and parameter handling approaches differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 71-100, 161-200, 311-370","Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper exception handling, well-defined functions, correct import statements, and robust error management. SQL parsing regex patterns are syntactically valid (lines 71-100). Batch processing logic is correctly implemented (lines 161-200). Minor issues: some variable references could be more defensive, and CSV escaping in line 185 could be enhanced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 51-80, 121-170, 171-250","Agent 2 shows good syntax correctness with proper function definitions, exception handling, and import statements. Main execution flow is logically sound (lines 171-250). Minor syntax concerns: variable 'report' used as both dictionary key and variable name (lines 121-170) could cause confusion. Error handling is present but less comprehensive than Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"All lines both agents","Both agents demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python syntax, proper imports, and functional code structure. Agent 1 slightly superior due to more robust error handling and defensive programming practices. Average correctness score reflects strong technical implementation in both cases."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,95,"Lines 161-200, 371-400","Agent 1 excels in production readiness with batch processing, comprehensive logging, and detailed reporting. Recommended for enterprise environments requiring robust error handling, audit trails, and scalable data processing. Consider enhancing CSV escaping (line 185) and adding more defensive variable checking."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,85,"Lines 121-170, 171-250","Agent 2 provides excellent foundation for simpler migration scenarios with clean, readable code structure. Recommended for development/testing environments or smaller data volumes. Consider enhancing error handling comprehensiveness and resolving variable naming ambiguity in comparison functions (lines 121-170)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,90,"All lines","Both agents successfully implement core migration validation requirements. Choose Agent 1 for production enterprise deployments requiring comprehensive features. Choose Agent 2 for simpler implementations or as foundation for customization. Both would benefit from additional input validation and configuration management improvements."
