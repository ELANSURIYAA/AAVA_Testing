Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs are JSON configurations for ETL jobs transferring CSV data to Snowflake. They share identical semantic intent and very similar structure, with minor differences in naming conventions, target table specifications, and connection details. Both are syntactically valid JSON with proper structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"","Both outputs serve identical purpose: ETL job for CSV to Snowflake data transfer with filtering and column renaming. Core functionality, transformation logic, and data flow are semantically equivalent. Minor differences in naming conventions (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob vs FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job) and descriptions do not affect semantic meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 15-35, 45-65","Both follow identical high-level structure: task object with name, type, description, steps array, and connections object. Steps follow same pattern: Source->Transformation->Target. Differences in Target step structure (lines 45-65): Agent 1 uses flat config structure while Agent 2 nests some options under data_load_options. Connection definitions also vary slightly in detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,100,"","Valid JSON syntax throughout. All object properties properly defined, arrays correctly structured, string values properly quoted. No syntax errors or malformed elements detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,95,"Line 37","Valid JSON syntax with one minor issue: contains JavaScript-style comment '// Add other columns as required...' on line 37, which is not valid in strict JSON. Otherwise properly structured with correct syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,"","Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are well-formed with only minor JSON comment syntax issue in second output."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,,"","Maintain current structure and syntax quality. Consider adding more descriptive comments in separate documentation rather than inline."
Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,,"Line 37","Remove JavaScript-style comment on line 37 to ensure strict JSON compliance. Consider restructuring data_load_options to match flatter configuration style for consistency."
