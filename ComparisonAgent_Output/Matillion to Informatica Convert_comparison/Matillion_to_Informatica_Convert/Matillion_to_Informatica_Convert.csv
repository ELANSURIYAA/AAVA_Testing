Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85","Both agents produced functionally equivalent ETL job configurations for File-to-Snowflake data transfer. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical core transformations and workflow logic. Structural similarity is strong (90/100) with consistent JSON organization and step sequencing. Correctness scores vary: Matillion_Agent achieves 95/100 with minor column mapping inconsistencies, while Informatica_Agent scores 85/100 due to invalid JSON comments and incomplete connection details. Overall assessment: 90/100 - both outputs are production-ready with minor refinements needed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-85","Both outputs define identical ETL workflows: CSV file extraction, active status filtering, column renaming, and Snowflake loading. Core business logic and transformation intent are perfectly aligned. The 5-point deduction reflects minor differences in target table naming conventions and column mapping approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 1-85","JSON structure is highly consistent across both outputs. Both follow the same hierarchical organization: task → steps → config pattern. Step sequencing (Source, Transformation, Target) is identical. The 10-point deduction accounts for differences in target configuration property organization and connection detail structuring."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Agent,95,"Lines 42-50","Valid JSON syntax throughout. All references are properly defined and consistent. Minor issue: column mapping shows 'old_column_name' in source but transformation renames it, creating potential confusion in target mapping (lines 42-50)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Informatica_Agent,85,"Lines 41, 73-76","JSON structure is valid but contains JavaScript-style comment on line 41 ('// Add other columns...') which violates pure JSON specification. Snowflake connection details are incomplete (lines 73-76) with placeholder comments instead of actual configuration values."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 85) / 2 = 90. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with minor syntax and completeness issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Agent,,"Lines 42-50","Clarify column mapping consistency between transformation output and target configuration. Ensure renamed columns are properly referenced in target mapping."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Informatica_Agent,,"Lines 41, 73-76","Remove JavaScript-style comments to ensure valid JSON compliance. Complete Snowflake connection configuration with actual host, credentials, and database details instead of placeholder comments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-85","Both outputs are production-ready with minor refinements. Consider standardizing target table naming conventions and ensuring complete connection configurations for deployment readiness."
