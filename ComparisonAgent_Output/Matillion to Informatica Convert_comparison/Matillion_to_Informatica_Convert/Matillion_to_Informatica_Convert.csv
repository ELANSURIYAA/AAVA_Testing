Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85","Both outputs represent JSON configurations for ETL jobs transferring data from CSV files to Snowflake with similar transformation steps. Key differences include job naming conventions, target table specifications, column mapping approaches, and connection object structures. Overall semantic alignment is strong with moderate structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-85","Both outputs address the same core ETL objective: reading CSV data, applying transformations (filtering active status, renaming columns), and loading to Snowflake. The semantic intent and business logic are highly aligned. Minor differences in naming conventions and configuration organization do not affect the underlying purpose and functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-85","Overall structure follows identical patterns with 'steps' array containing Source->Transformation->Target flow. Key structural differences: Matillion_Agent uses 'FileToSnowflakeMappingJob' (line 3) vs Informatica_Agent 'FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job' (line 3), different target_object names (line 45 vs 45), and load configuration organization varies (lines 46-65 vs 46-70). Connection objects have different property sets (lines 66-85)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Agent,95,"Lines 1-85","Valid JSON structure with proper syntax. All required properties present and correctly formatted. Minor issue: column mapping references 'old_column_name' in target mapping (line 52) but transformation renames it to 'new_column_name', creating potential inconsistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Informatica_Agent,88,"Lines 1-85","Valid JSON structure with proper syntax. Issues identified: Contains JavaScript-style comment '// Add other columns...' (line 56) which is invalid in pure JSON. Connection object missing critical Snowflake properties like host, warehouse, credentials (lines 75-80). Incomplete column mapping array with comment instead of actual mappings."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores (95 + 88) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Agent,,"Lines 50-55","Verify column mapping consistency between transformation output ('new_column_name') and target mapping references. Ensure all transformed columns are properly mapped to target schema."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Informatica_Agent,,"Lines 56, 75-80","Remove JavaScript-style comments for valid JSON compliance. Complete connection object with required Snowflake properties (host, warehouse, database, schema, credentials). Finish column mapping array with actual column definitions instead of placeholder comments."
