Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs represent ETL job configurations for transferring data from CSV files to Snowflake with transformations. They share nearly identical semantic intent and structural approach, with Agent 1 providing a more complete and syntactically correct configuration (score: 90) compared to Agent 2 which has minor syntax issues and incomplete connection details (score: 80). Overall similarity is high at 85%."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: defining an ETL pipeline from CSV file to Snowflake with filtering and column renaming transformations. The semantic intent is nearly identical - both implement the same business logic of reading CSV data, filtering for active status, renaming columns, and loading to Snowflake. Minor differences exist in naming conventions (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob vs FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job) and description phrasing, but the underlying meaning and purpose are equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs follow the same high-level JSON structure with 'task' as root containing name, type, description, steps, and connections. The steps array contains identical sequence: Source -> Transformation -> Target. Transformation steps are structurally identical with same filter and rename operations. Minor structural differences include: Agent 2 adds file_format and stage properties in different locations (lines 35, 37 in Agent 2), and organizes data_load_options as nested object (lines 40-43 in Agent 2) vs flat properties in Agent 1 (lines 30-31)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,95,N/A,"Agent 1 output has valid JSON syntax with proper structure and consistent property definitions. All connection references are properly defined and complete. Minor deduction for using 'old_column_name' in target mapping (line 29) which should reference 'new_column_name' after the rename transformation for logical consistency."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,75,35,"Agent 2 output has several syntax and completeness issues: (1) Invalid JavaScript-style comment on line 35 '// Add other columns as required...' which breaks JSON parsing, (2) Incomplete Snowflake_Connection definition missing critical properties like host, warehouse, username, password, database, schema (lines 45-50), (3) Comment on line 50 '// Add credentials...' indicates incomplete configuration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,N/A,"Average correctness score of 85 reflects one well-formed configuration (Agent 1: 95) and one with notable syntax/completeness issues (Agent 2: 75). The syntax error in Agent 2 would prevent successful parsing and execution."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,N/A,N/A,"Fix logical inconsistency in target column mapping (line 29) - should map 'new_column_name' to 'new_column_name' instead of 'old_column_name' to 'new_column_name' since the rename transformation occurs before loading."
Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,N/A,35,"Critical fixes needed: (1) Remove JavaScript-style comment on line 35 to ensure valid JSON, (2) Complete Snowflake_Connection configuration with required properties (host, warehouse, credentials), (3) Remove comment on line 50 and provide actual connection details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both configurations would benefit from: (1) Adding error handling configurations, (2) Including data validation steps, (3) Specifying column data types explicitly, (4) Adding logging and monitoring configurations for production deployment."
