Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two JSON ETL job configurations with high semantic and structural similarity but differing correctness due to invalid JSON syntax in FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job"
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs address identical ETL goals (CSV to Snowflake) with same transformation logic. Minor differences in task naming (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob vs FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job) and target table references (target_table vs my_snowflake_target_table). Core intent and functionality are aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,,"Nearly identical JSON structure with task/steps/connections hierarchy. Both have 3 steps (Source, Transform, Target) with same transformation sub-steps. Minor structural differences in Load_Into_Snowflake config organization and connection detail placement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,100,,"Valid JSON syntax throughout. All references are consistent. Well-formed configuration with proper field types and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,75,"Line 34, Line 42","Invalid JSON syntax due to JavaScript-style comment on line 34 ('// Add other columns as required...'). Incomplete connection configuration with placeholder comment on line 42. Otherwise structurally sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,,"Average of individual correctness scores (100 + 75) / 2 = 87.5, rounded to 88"

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,,"Remove JavaScript-style comments (line 34) and replace with valid JSON. Complete connection configuration details (line 42) with actual values instead of placeholder comments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,,"Configuration is well-formed. Consider adding more descriptive task naming to match FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Standardize naming conventions across configurations. Consider adding validation for required connection parameters. Both configurations would benefit from more explicit error handling configuration."
