Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs represent functionally equivalent ETL job configurations for File-to-Snowflake data transfer with transformations. FileToSnowflakeMappingJob and FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job demonstrate nearly identical semantic intent and structural organization, with minor variations in naming conventions and configuration details. Key differences include step naming (Read_Source_File vs Extract_File_Data), target object specification, and connection parameter organization. FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job contains a JSON comment (line 31) which violates JSON syntax standards, and incomplete connection details, impacting correctness scores."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-70","Both outputs address identical ETL workflow requirements: extract CSV data, apply status filtering and column renaming transformations, then load to Snowflake. The semantic intent, data flow logic, and business purpose are virtually identical. Minor semantic differences include more descriptive naming in FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job and slight variations in configuration parameter organization."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-70","Overall structural organization is highly similar with task->steps->connections hierarchy. Both follow identical step sequence: Source->Transformation->Target. Key structural differences: step naming conventions (Read_Source_File vs Extract_File_Data), configuration parameter grouping (data_load_options nested vs flat structure), and connection object organization. The logical flow and decomposition approach remain consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,100,"Lines 1-35","Syntactically valid JSON throughout. All objects properly closed, consistent comma usage, valid property names and values. No undefined references or broken syntax. Connection parameters are complete and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,75,"Lines 31,36-40","Contains invalid JSON comment syntax on line 31 ('// Add other columns as required...'). JSON standard does not support comments, making this technically invalid. Additionally, incomplete connection details in Snowflake_Connection object (lines 36-40) with placeholder comment instead of actual configuration parameters."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 75) / 2 = 87.5, rounded to 88. FileToSnowflakeMappingJob demonstrates perfect JSON syntax compliance, while FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job has syntax violations and incomplete configuration."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,,"Configuration is syntactically correct and complete. Consider adding more descriptive step names and documentation for better maintainability. The current structure is production-ready."
Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,,"Remove JSON comment on line 31 to ensure valid JSON syntax. Complete the Snowflake_Connection configuration with actual connection parameters instead of placeholder comments. Consider restructuring data_load_options to match standard conventions. Once corrected, this configuration will be equivalent to FileToSnowflakeMappingJob."
