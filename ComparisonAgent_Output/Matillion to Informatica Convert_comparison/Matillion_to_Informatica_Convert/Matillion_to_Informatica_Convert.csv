Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-64, 1-67","Both outputs define ETL jobs for transferring CSV data to Snowflake with identical transformation logic. FileToSnowflakeMappingJob and FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical business intent. Structural similarity is strong (90/100) with consistent JSON hierarchy and step organization. Correctness varies: FileToSnowflakeMappingJob achieves 95/100 with valid JSON syntax, while FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job scores 85/100 due to invalid JavaScript-style comment on line 32. Overall assessment: 90/100 - highly compatible outputs with minor syntax issue in second agent."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 2-3, 2-4","Both outputs address the same core business requirement: File-to-Snowflake ETL with filtering and column renaming. Task names differ (FileToSnowflakeMappingJob vs FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job) but descriptions convey identical intent. Transformation logic is semantically equivalent: both filter for active status and rename columns. Minor semantic differences in target configuration details (target_object values, data_load_options structure) but core functionality remains aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,"Lines 4-63, 4-66","JSON structure follows identical hierarchy: task -> name/type/description/steps/connections. Step organization matches: Source -> Transformation -> Target pattern. Transformation steps maintain same order and nesting. Minor structural differences in target configuration: FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job adds file_format and data_load_options wrapper (lines 42-46) while FileToSnowflakeMappingJob uses flat structure (lines 35-39). Connection definitions follow same pattern with slight property variations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,95,"Lines 1-64","Valid JSON syntax throughout. All object references are consistent and properly defined. Column mappings align between transformation steps and target configuration. Connection references (File_Connection, Snowflake_Connection) are properly declared and used. Minor issue: target columns reference both original (status) and renamed (old_column_name) columns which could cause confusion but is syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,85,"Line 32","Contains invalid JavaScript-style comment '// Add other columns as required...' within JSON structure, violating JSON specification. Additionally, line 67 contains similar comment '// Add credentials and other connection details...'. Otherwise valid JSON structure with consistent object references and proper nesting. Column mapping shows only renamed column, which is more logically consistent than first agent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score across both agents. FileToSnowflakeMappingJob demonstrates superior JSON compliance while FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job contains syntax violations that would prevent parsing in strict JSON environments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflakeMappingJob,,"Lines 35-44","Consider consolidating column mappings to include only transformed columns in target configuration for clarity. Review whether both original and renamed columns should be loaded to target table."
Recommendations,Recommendation,FileToSnowflake_ETL_Job,,"Lines 32, 67","Critical: Remove JavaScript-style comments (// syntax) and replace with valid JSON structure or external documentation. Comments on lines 32 and 67 prevent JSON parsing. Consider using description fields for documentation instead."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-67","Both configurations would benefit from explicit error handling configuration and data validation steps. Consider adding schema validation and data quality checks in transformation layer. Standardize connection parameter naming conventions across both approaches."
