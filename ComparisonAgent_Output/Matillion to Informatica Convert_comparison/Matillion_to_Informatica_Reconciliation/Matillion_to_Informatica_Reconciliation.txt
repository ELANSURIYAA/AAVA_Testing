# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent 1 and Agent 2 both provide comprehensive ETL testing solutions with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent 2 demonstrates superior coverage with 15 test cases vs 8, better structure with markdown tables and proper fixtures, and more robust error handling. Both outputs are syntactically correct but differ significantly in comprehensiveness and professional presentation.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address ETL testing with similar core concepts: reading CSV files, filtering data, renaming columns, and loading to Snowflake. Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality while Agent 2 includes comprehensive edge cases like empty files, null handling, performance testing, and error scenarios. The semantic intent overlaps significantly but Agent 2 provides broader coverage.

**Key Similarities:**
- Both test CSV file reading with headers
- Both validate status filtering for "active" records
- Both test column renaming functionality
- Both include Snowflake loading validation
- Both handle null values and error scenarios

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 2 includes 7 additional test cases covering edge cases
- Agent 2 provides more detailed error handling scenarios
- Agent 2 includes performance testing considerations

### Structural Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Agent 1 uses simple text format for test cases followed by basic pytest functions. Agent 2 uses structured markdown tables and professional pytest organization with fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive test coverage. Both follow logical ETL testing flow but with different levels of sophistication in structure and organization.

**Structural Differences:**
- Agent 1: Simple text format vs Agent 2: Markdown table format
- Agent 1: Basic pytest structure vs Agent 2: Professional fixtures and helpers
- Agent 1: 8 test functions vs Agent 2: 15 comprehensive test functions
- Agent 2 includes proper test isolation and cleanup mechanisms

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100)**
The pytest script has minor issues including missing proper fixtures setup, hardcoded paths without proper mocking, and basic error handling. The syntax is valid but lacks professional testing practices like proper test isolation and cleanup.

**Agent 2 (Score: 98/100)**
Demonstrates excellent practices with proper fixtures, temporary file handling, comprehensive error testing, and clean test isolation. Minor deduction for simulated Snowflake operations that could be more realistic.

**Overall Correctness: 96.5/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Structural Similarity | 65 | 65 | 65 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 96.5 |
| **Overall** | **78.3** | **79.3** | **78.8** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
- Enhance test case documentation with structured format
- Add comprehensive edge case testing
- Implement proper pytest fixtures
- Include performance and error handling tests

**For Agent 2:**
- Consider adding more realistic Snowflake connection mocking
- Include data validation assertions
- Add integration test scenarios for end-to-end ETL pipeline validation
