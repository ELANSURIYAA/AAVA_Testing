Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide ETL testing frameworks with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent_1 delivers 8 test cases with basic coverage, while Agent_2 provides 15 comprehensive test cases with better structure, fixtures, and error handling. Agent_2 demonstrates superior testing practices with proper setup/teardown, edge case coverage, and performance testing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Agent_1: Lines 1-50, Agent_2: Lines 1-120","Both outputs address the same ETL testing domain with core operations (CSV reading, filtering, column renaming, Snowflake loading). However, Agent_2 provides significantly more comprehensive coverage including edge cases (empty files, null handling, performance testing, error scenarios) that Agent_1 lacks. The semantic intent is aligned but Agent_2 demonstrates deeper understanding of testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Agent_1: Lines 51-100, Agent_2: Lines 121-250","Both follow similar high-level structure (test cases document + pytest script). Agent_2 shows superior organization with proper pytest fixtures (@pytest.fixture), helper functions, and better separation of concerns. Agent_1 uses simpler structure but lacks the sophisticated setup that Agent_2 provides. Test case documentation format differs (numbered list vs table format)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 75, 85, 95","Agent_1 pytest script has valid Python syntax but contains some issues: missing proper imports for etl_job module (line 75), hardcoded file paths without proper test data setup, and simplified mock assertions that may not reflect real testing scenarios. The test structure is functional but lacks robustness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 180, 200","Agent_2 demonstrates excellent pytest practices with proper fixtures, temporary file handling, and comprehensive error testing. Minor issues include some simplified mock implementations (lines 180, 200) for Snowflake connectivity, but overall structure is production-ready with proper setup/teardown and edge case handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score reflecting that both outputs are syntactically valid with Agent_2 showing superior implementation practices and more robust error handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance test coverage by adding edge cases (empty files, null handling, performance testing). Implement proper pytest fixtures for better test isolation. Add comprehensive error handling tests. Improve mock implementations for external dependencies like Snowflake connectivity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Consider adding more detailed assertions in mock Snowflake operations. Add integration test examples with actual Snowflake connector. Include data validation tests to ensure transformation accuracy. Consider adding configuration-driven test scenarios for different environments."
