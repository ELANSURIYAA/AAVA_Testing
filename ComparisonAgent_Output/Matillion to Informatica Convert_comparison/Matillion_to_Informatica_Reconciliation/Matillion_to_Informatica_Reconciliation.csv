Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 provides 8 basic test cases with simple pytest implementation, while Agent 2 delivers 15 comprehensive test cases with advanced pytest features including fixtures, helper functions, and better error handling. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage, structure, and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-80","Both outputs address ETL testing for CSV processing with filtering and Snowflake loading. Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality (read, filter, rename, load) while Agent 2 expands to include edge cases, error handling, and performance testing. Core semantic intent is aligned but Agent 2 provides broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-30 vs 1-15, Lines 31-80 vs 16-120","Agent 1 uses simple numbered test cases (TC001-TC008) with basic pytest functions. Agent 2 uses table format for test cases (TC01-TC15) and sophisticated pytest structure with fixtures, helper functions, and parametrized tests. Different organizational approaches but similar logical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,85,"Lines 35, 42, 48","Pytest syntax is valid but has issues: undefined 'etl_job' import (line 35), mock Snowflake operations lack proper assertions (line 48), and some test functions are incomplete (line 42). Basic structure is sound but implementation has gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 25-30, 85-90","Excellent pytest implementation with proper fixtures, comprehensive test coverage, and realistic mock operations. Minor issues with some hardcoded values in performance tests (line 85) and simplified Snowflake simulation (line 90). Overall very well-structured and syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of Agent 1 (85) and Agent 2 (95). Agent 2 significantly outperforms Agent 1 in implementation quality and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Improve test implementation by adding proper imports, complete mock operations for Snowflake testing, and expand test coverage to include edge cases and error scenarios. Consider adopting fixture-based approach for better test organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Excellent implementation overall. Minor improvements could include more realistic Snowflake connection testing and dynamic test data generation. Consider adding integration tests with actual Snowflake instances for production readiness."
