Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 and Agent 2 both provide comprehensive ETL testing solutions with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent 2 demonstrates superior coverage with 15 test cases vs 8, better structure with markdown tables and proper fixtures, and more robust error handling. Both outputs are syntactically correct but differ significantly in comprehensiveness and professional presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","Both outputs address ETL testing with similar core concepts: reading CSV files, filtering data, renaming columns, and loading to Snowflake. Agent 1 focuses on basic functionality while Agent 2 includes comprehensive edge cases like empty files, null handling, performance testing, and error scenarios. The semantic intent overlaps significantly but Agent 2 provides broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","Agent 1 uses simple text format for test cases followed by basic pytest functions. Agent 2 uses structured markdown tables and professional pytest organization with fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive test coverage. Both follow logical ETL testing flow but with different levels of sophistication in structure and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 25-50","Agent 1 pytest script has minor issues: missing proper fixtures setup, hardcoded paths without proper mocking, and basic error handling. The syntax is valid but lacks professional testing practices like proper test isolation and cleanup."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 50-150","Agent 2 pytest script demonstrates excellent practices with proper fixtures, temporary file handling, comprehensive error testing, and clean test isolation. Minor deduction for simulated Snowflake operations that could be more realistic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,,"Both outputs are syntactically correct with Agent 2 showing superior testing practices and more comprehensive implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Enhance test case documentation with structured format, add comprehensive edge case testing, implement proper pytest fixtures, and include performance and error handling tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Consider adding more realistic Snowflake connection mocking, include data validation assertions, and add integration test scenarios for end-to-end ETL pipeline validation."
