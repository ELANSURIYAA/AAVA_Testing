Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Output 1 and Agent Output 2 both provide test cases and pytest scripts for ETL processes, but with significant differences in scope, structure, and implementation quality. Agent Output 2 demonstrates superior comprehensiveness with 15 test cases versus 8, better organization with table format and fixtures, and more robust error handling. Both outputs address the same core ETL testing requirements but with different levels of detail and professional implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-100 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address ETL testing for the same core operations: reading CSV files, filtering by status, renaming columns, and loading to Snowflake. However, Agent Output 2 includes additional semantic coverage for edge cases like empty files, null handling, performance testing, and error scenarios that Agent Output 1 lacks. The core intent is aligned but Agent Output 2 provides more comprehensive semantic coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-25 (Agent 1), Lines 1-50 (Agent 2)","Agent Output 1 uses simple text format for test cases while Agent Output 2 uses structured table format. Agent Output 1 has basic pytest structure while Agent Output 2 includes proper fixtures, helper functions, and modular design. The overall flow is similar (test cases followed by pytest script) but the internal organization differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_1,85,"Lines 26-50","Pytest script has valid syntax but lacks proper fixtures and has some issues: missing imports for etl_job module (line 4), hardcoded file paths without proper test data setup, and basic assertions without comprehensive validation. The test structure is functional but not production-ready."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_2,95,"Lines 51-150","Pytest script demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper fixtures, comprehensive imports, helper functions, and robust test implementations. Minor deduction for mock implementations that would need real Snowflake connector integration in production environment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_1,,"Enhance test case documentation with structured format, add comprehensive edge case coverage, implement proper pytest fixtures, and improve error handling scenarios. Consider adding performance and data integrity tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_2,,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Minor improvements: integrate actual Snowflake connector for realistic testing, add more specific performance thresholds, and consider parameterized tests for better maintainability."
