Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two ETL test case implementations reveals significant differences in comprehensiveness and structure. Matillion_Agent provides 8 basic test cases with simple pytest implementation, while Informatica_Agent delivers 15 detailed test cases with advanced pytest features including fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive error handling. Both outputs address the same ETL workflow (CSV reading, filtering, column renaming, Snowflake loading) but with different levels of detail and testing rigor."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Both outputs target the same ETL workflow with core operations: CSV file reading, status filtering, column renaming, and Snowflake loading. However, Informatica_Agent includes additional semantic coverage for edge cases (empty files, missing headers, null handling, performance testing, data integrity) that Matillion_Agent lacks. The fundamental intent is aligned but Informatica_Agent demonstrates deeper understanding of comprehensive testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,Lines 1-50 vs 1-80,"Structural approaches differ significantly. Matillion_Agent uses simple sequential test case documentation and basic pytest functions. Informatica_Agent employs structured table format for test cases and sophisticated pytest architecture with fixtures (@pytest.fixture), helper functions, and parameterized testing patterns. The logical flow is similar but implementation structure varies considerably."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Matillion_Agent,85,Lines 25-50,"Pytest syntax is mostly correct with proper imports and basic test structure. Minor issues: line 15 assumes etl_job module exists without definition, line 35 uses undefined transformed_file.csv path, line 45 has hardcoded threshold without context. Missing proper fixture cleanup and error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Informatica_Agent,95,Lines 40-120,"Excellent pytest implementation with proper fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive test coverage. Minor syntax issue: line 85 could benefit from more specific exception handling. Well-structured with proper setup/teardown, realistic test data generation, and appropriate assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score reflects solid implementation quality with Informatica_Agent showing superior technical execution and Matillion_Agent having basic but functional structure with minor technical gaps."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Matillion_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-25,"Enhance test case documentation with structured format including input/output specifications. Add comprehensive edge case coverage (empty files, null handling, error scenarios). Implement proper pytest fixtures for setup/teardown. Include performance and data integrity testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Informatica_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-40,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Minor improvements: add more specific exception types in error handling tests, include actual Snowflake connector integration examples, and consider adding data validation assertions beyond count checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"For production use, recommend adopting Informatica_Agent approach as the foundation due to superior structure, comprehensive coverage, and professional pytest implementation. Consider integrating Matillion_Agent's simplicity for basic smoke tests while maintaining Informatica_Agent's rigor for comprehensive validation."
