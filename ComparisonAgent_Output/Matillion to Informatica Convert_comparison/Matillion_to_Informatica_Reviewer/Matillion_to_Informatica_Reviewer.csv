Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-4 vs 1-3,"Both outputs provide comprehensive evaluation reports of Matillion ETL to Informatica IICS conversion. Agent 1 focuses on accuracy assessment with clear checkmarks and issues identification. Agent 2 provides more detailed technical analysis with specific file paths and comprehensive test case coverage. Both conclude successful conversion with recommendations for improvement."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-35 vs 1-89,"Both outputs address the same core objective: evaluating Matillion to Informatica IICS conversion accuracy. They share identical transformation logic analysis (filter status='active', rename old_column_name to new_column_name) and similar conclusions about successful conversion. Agent 2 provides more technical depth with specific file paths, JSON structure details, and comprehensive test case coverage. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses on checklist-style validation while Agent 2 provides operational details and edge case handling."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-35 vs 1-89,"Both follow similar 6-section structure: Executive Summary, Conversion Assessment, Detailed Findings, Issues/Discrepancies, Recommendations, Conclusion. Agent 1 uses numbered subsections (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) while Agent 2 uses similar but more detailed subsection organization. Agent 2 includes additional elements like Legend, Supporting Details, and Test Cases sections. Both use checkmark/X mark notation for status indicators. Flow and logical decomposition are highly aligned despite different levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Lines 1-35,"Well-formed report structure with consistent formatting. All internal references are valid. Proper use of checkmarks and X marks for status indication. Minor formatting inconsistency in bullet point usage but no syntax errors. Clear section numbering and logical flow maintained throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,Lines 1-89,"Excellent structure with comprehensive formatting. All internal references valid including file paths and technical specifications. Consistent use of markdown-style formatting with proper legend notation. Supporting details section provides clear technical specifications. Minor redundancy in some sections but no syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, valid internal references, and consistent structure. Agent 2 shows slightly better organization and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,Lines 28-34,"Enhance error handling mechanisms beyond basic 'continue on error'. Add comprehensive data quality validation checks. Implement performance monitoring and resource utilization tracking. Consider adding detailed execution logging for operational visibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,Lines 65-72,"Leverage the comprehensive test case framework already outlined. Implement the detailed operational monitoring suggested. Add the security and compliance configurations mentioned. Consider the edge case handling recommendations for production robustness. Utilize the supporting technical details for implementation guidance."
