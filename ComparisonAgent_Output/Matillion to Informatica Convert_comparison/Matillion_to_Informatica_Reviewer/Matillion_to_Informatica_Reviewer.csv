Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-6 vs Lines 1-3,"Both reports provide comprehensive evaluations of Matillion to Informatica IICS ETL conversion. Report_1 focuses on core functionality preservation with identified optimization areas. Report_2 provides more detailed analysis with structured findings and comprehensive test coverage. Both conclude successful conversion with recommendations for enhancement."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-80,"Both reports address identical core objective: evaluating Matillion ETL job conversion to Informatica IICS. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both confirm successful conversion preservation of core functionality, (2) Both identify same transformation logic (filter status='active', rename column), (3) Both highlight same data flow (CSV->transform->Snowflake), (4) Both recommend similar improvements (error handling, data quality, performance monitoring). Minor semantic differences: Report_2 provides more granular analysis with explicit test case coverage and operational details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-80,"Both follow similar high-level structure: Executive Summary, Conversion Assessment, Detailed Findings, Discrepancies, Recommendations, Conclusion. Key structural differences: Report_1 uses 6 main sections with subsections 3.1-3.3, Report_2 uses 6 sections plus additional supporting details and legend. Report_2 includes more structured formatting with checkmarks, explicit test case documentation, and operational clarity sections. Both maintain logical flow from assessment to recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_1,98,Lines 15-20,"Report_1 is syntactically correct with proper formatting and consistent structure. Minor issue: Line 15-16 formatting inconsistency in bullet point alignment within section 3.1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_2,100,,"Report_2 is syntactically perfect with consistent formatting, proper markdown structure, clear section delineation, and well-organized content hierarchy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Both reports demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Average score reflects minor formatting inconsistency in Report_1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Report_1,,Lines 25-30,"Enhance formatting consistency in subsection bullet points. Consider adding more detailed operational guidance and test case documentation similar to Report_2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Report_2,,Lines 45-60,"Maintain current comprehensive structure and detailed analysis approach. Consider condensing supporting details section to improve readability while preserving technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both reports successfully evaluate ETL conversion accuracy. For future iterations: (1) Standardize formatting conventions, (2) Include explicit test coverage documentation, (3) Add quantitative performance metrics, (4) Enhance operational monitoring recommendations with specific tools and thresholds."
