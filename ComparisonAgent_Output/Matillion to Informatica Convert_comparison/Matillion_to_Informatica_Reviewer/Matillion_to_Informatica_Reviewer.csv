Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive evaluations of Matillion ETL to Informatica IICS conversion accuracy. Agent 1 focuses on core functionality preservation with minor optimization areas. Agent 2 provides more detailed analysis including test cases and operational considerations. Both conclude successful conversion with improvement recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same conversion evaluation task with similar conclusions. Agent 1 uses a more concise approach while Agent 2 provides comprehensive analysis. Both identify successful core functionality preservation and similar improvement areas (error handling, data quality, performance optimization). Minor differences in emphasis and detail level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both follow similar high-level structure with Executive Summary, Assessment, Findings, and Recommendations. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-6) while Agent 2 uses numbered sections with more detailed subsections. Agent 2 includes additional supporting details section and test case references not present in Agent 1. Overall flow and logical progression are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,,"Well-formed document with consistent formatting, proper use of checkmarks and X marks for status indicators, numbered sections, and clear internal structure. Minor issue: some bullet points could be more consistently formatted (lines 15-17)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,,"Excellent formatting with consistent structure, proper use of markdown elements, clear section delineation, and comprehensive supporting details. Very minor formatting inconsistency in legend placement (line 45)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper document structure, consistent internal references, and valid formatting throughout."
