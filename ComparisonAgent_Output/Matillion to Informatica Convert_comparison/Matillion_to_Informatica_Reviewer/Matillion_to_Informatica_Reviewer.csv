Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-6,"Both outputs provide comprehensive evaluations of Matillion ETL to Informatica IICS conversion accuracy. Agent_1 presents a structured numbered approach with clear checkmarks and X marks for status indicators. Agent_2 provides more detailed analysis with proper markdown formatting and additional supporting documentation. Both conclude the conversion preserves core functionality but requires improvements in error handling and performance optimization."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: evaluating Matillion to Informatica IICS conversion accuracy. They cover the same key areas (data flow, transformation logic, performance, recommendations) with nearly identical conclusions. Minor differences in emphasis on specific technical details and presentation style, but core meaning and intent are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-50,"Both follow very similar 6-section structure: Executive Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Detailed Findings, Issues/Discrepancies, Recommendations, Conclusion. Agent_1 uses numbered sections (1-6) while Agent_2 uses markdown headers. Agent_2 includes additional Legend and Supporting Details sections. Overall flow and logical decomposition are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-25,"Well-formed structure with consistent numbered sections, proper use of checkmarks and X marks for status indicators. All internal references are consistent. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point alignment but no syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,1-60,"Excellent markdown formatting with proper headers, consistent use of status indicators, well-structured supporting details section. All internal references are accurate and consistent. Includes proper legend and supporting documentation. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and consistent internal structure. Agent_2 has slightly better formatting and documentation structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,15-25,"Consider adopting more detailed markdown formatting for better readability. Add supporting documentation section similar to Agent_2 for operational clarity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,45-60,"Maintain current high-quality formatting and documentation standards. Consider adding more explicit status indicators like checkmarks for quick visual assessment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-60,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting approach, 2) More detailed line-by-line technical comparison sections, 3) Quantitative metrics for performance assessment, 4) Explicit test case validation results."
