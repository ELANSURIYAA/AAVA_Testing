Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide test cases and pytest scripts for ETL data pipeline testing involving CSV reading, data filtering, column renaming, and Snowflake loading. Agent 1 provides 8 basic test cases with a simple pytest implementation, while Agent 2 delivers 15 comprehensive test cases with a more sophisticated testing framework including fixtures, helper functions, and better error handling. The outputs share similar core testing objectives but differ significantly in completeness, structure, and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"","Both outputs address the same fundamental ETL testing requirements: CSV file reading, status filtering, column renaming, and Snowflake loading. However, Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage with additional edge cases (empty files, missing headers, null handling, performance testing) that Agent 1 lacks. The core semantic intent is aligned but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"","Significant structural differences exist. Agent 1 uses a simple numbered list format (TC001-TC008) with basic pytest functions, while Agent 2 employs a professional table format (TC01-TC15) with comprehensive fixtures, helper functions, and proper test organization. Agent 1 structure: lines 1-24 (test list), lines 26-69 (pytest script). Agent 2 structure: lines 1-17 (table format), lines 19-185 (comprehensive pytest with fixtures)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,65,"Lines 32, 35, 41, 56, 62","Agent 1 has several syntax and implementation issues: undefined 'run_etl' function (line 32), hardcoded file paths without proper setup, incomplete Snowflake mocking (lines 56-62), and missing proper test fixtures. The pytest structure is basic but functional for simple cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Line 185","Agent 2 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with proper fixtures, helper functions, comprehensive test coverage, and realistic mocking. Minor deduction for the comment about API cost at line 185 which seems out of place in test code."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 32-69","Agent 1 should implement proper test fixtures, remove hardcoded paths, add comprehensive mocking for Snowflake connections, and expand test coverage to include edge cases like empty files and error handling."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Line 185","Agent 2 should remove the extraneous API cost comment and consider adding integration tests with actual Snowflake connections for more realistic testing scenarios."
