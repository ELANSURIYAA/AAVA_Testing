Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two agent outputs for ETL test case generation were compared. Agent_1 provided 8 test cases with basic pytest implementation, while Agent_2 delivered 15 comprehensive test cases with sophisticated pytest structure including fixtures and helper functions. Agent_2 demonstrates superior coverage, structure, and implementation quality across all evaluation dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs address the same core ETL testing requirements: CSV reading, status filtering, column renaming, and Snowflake loading. Agent_1 covers fundamental scenarios (lines 1-8 in test list) while Agent_2 provides comprehensive coverage including edge cases like empty files, missing headers, and connection failures (lines 1-15 in table). The semantic intent is aligned but Agent_2 shows deeper understanding of testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,,"Significant structural differences exist. Agent_1 uses simple bullet-point format for test cases (lines 1-25) and basic pytest functions (lines 27-65). Agent_2 employs professional table format (lines 1-16) and sophisticated pytest architecture with fixtures (lines 18-35), helper functions (lines 37-48), and comprehensive test implementations (lines 50-180). Both follow logical ETL testing flow but with different organizational approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,70,"Lines 35, 45, 50, 55","Syntax is generally correct but has issues: hardcoded file paths without proper setup (line 35), incomplete Snowflake mocking (line 50), basic exception handling (line 60), and missing proper test data setup. The pytest structure is functional but lacks robustness for production testing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 25-35, 140-145","Excellent syntax and structure with proper fixtures, temporary file handling, and comprehensive test implementations. Minor issues include some mock implementations that could be more detailed (lines 140-145) and the Snowflake connection simulation could be more realistic. Overall demonstrates professional testing practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,81,,"Average of Agent_1 (70) and Agent_2 (92). Agent_2 significantly outperforms with proper testing infrastructure while Agent_1 provides basic but functional implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Improve test infrastructure by adding proper fixtures and temporary file handling. Replace hardcoded paths with parameterized test data. Enhance Snowflake mocking with realistic connection simulation. Add more comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage to match industry standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent implementation that serves as a best practice example. Consider adding more detailed Snowflake connector mocking and potentially include integration test scenarios. The comprehensive fixture usage and test coverage demonstrate professional testing standards that should be maintained."
