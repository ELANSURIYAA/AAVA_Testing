Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both outputs provide test case lists and pytest scripts for ETL data pipeline testing, but differ significantly in comprehensiveness and structure. Agent 2 provides nearly double the test cases (15 vs 8) with more detailed edge case coverage and better pytest implementation practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"","Both outputs address the same core ETL testing requirements: reading CSV files, filtering data, renaming columns, and loading to Snowflake. However, Agent 2 includes additional semantic coverage for edge cases like empty files, missing headers, null handling, and error scenarios that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"","Agent 1 uses a simple numbered list format (TC001-TC008) while Agent 2 uses a structured table format (TC01-TC15). The pytest implementations differ significantly - Agent 1 has basic functions while Agent 2 employs proper fixtures, helper functions, and more sophisticated test organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 29, 35, 41","Agent 1 has valid Python syntax but contains some issues: hardcoded file paths without proper test data setup, missing proper assertions in test_load_into_snowflake (line 41), and incomplete error handling in test_missing_source_file (line 35)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Line 156","Agent 2 demonstrates superior correctness with proper fixtures, comprehensive test setup, and better error handling. Minor issue with potential AnalysisException handling in rename_nonexistent_column test (line 156) but overall excellent implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"","Average of individual agent scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Agent 2 significantly outperforms Agent 1 in correctness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,"","Lines 29-47","Agent 1 should implement proper test fixtures for file setup, add comprehensive assertions in Snowflake loading tests, improve error handling specificity, and expand test coverage to include edge cases like empty files and null values."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,"","Line 156","Agent 2 should consider adding more specific exception types in error handling tests and could benefit from additional performance benchmarking assertions. Overall excellent implementation that serves as a best practice example."
