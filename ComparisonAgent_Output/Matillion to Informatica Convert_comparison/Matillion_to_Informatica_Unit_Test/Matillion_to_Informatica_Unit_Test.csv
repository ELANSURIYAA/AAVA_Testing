Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Output 1 and Agent Output 2 both provide ETL testing frameworks with test cases and pytest implementations. Agent Output 2 demonstrates significantly superior coverage with 15 test cases versus 8, more comprehensive error handling, better code organization with fixtures and helper functions, and more detailed test scenarios including edge cases. While both outputs are syntactically correct, Agent Output 2 provides a more production-ready testing solution with better structure and maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-150","Both outputs address ETL testing for the same core functionality (CSV reading, filtering, column renaming, Snowflake loading). However, Agent Output 2 provides significantly broader test coverage including edge cases like empty files, missing headers, null values, performance testing, and error scenarios that Agent Output 1 lacks. The semantic intent is aligned but Agent Output 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of comprehensive testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-150","Both outputs follow a similar two-part structure (test case list + pytest script), but differ significantly in organization. Agent Output 1 uses a simple numbered list format, while Agent Output 2 uses a structured table format. Agent Output 2 introduces pytest fixtures, helper functions, and more sophisticated test organization that Agent Output 1 lacks. The overall flow is similar but implementation approaches differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_1,95,"Lines 20-50","Pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixture usage, and test function definitions. Minor issue: line 15 has a hardcoded path '/path/to/source_file.csv' that would fail in actual execution. All other syntax elements are valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Output_2,100,"Lines 30-150","Pytest script is syntactically perfect with proper imports, fixtures, helper functions, and comprehensive test implementations. Uses tmp_path fixture correctly for file creation, proper exception handling with pytest.raises, and all syntax elements are valid and executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,,"Average of both agent correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_1,,"Enhance test coverage by adding edge cases like empty files, null value handling, and error scenarios. Implement pytest fixtures for better test data management. Add performance testing capabilities. Replace hardcoded file paths with configurable or temporary paths."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Output_2,,"Excellent comprehensive testing approach. Consider adding more specific assertions for data validation and potentially include integration tests with actual Snowflake connections (mocked appropriately). The current implementation serves as a strong foundation for production ETL testing."
