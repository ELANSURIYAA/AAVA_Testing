Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two ETL test case outputs for Matillion to Informatica conversion. Agent 1 provides 8 basic test cases with simple pytest implementation. Agent 2 delivers 15 comprehensive test cases with advanced pytest patterns including fixtures and helper functions. Both address core ETL validation requirements but differ significantly in depth and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs target ETL job validation for Matillion to Informatica conversion with overlapping core scenarios: CSV reading (Agent 1 TC001 vs Agent 2 TC01-TC03), status filtering (Agent 1 TC002 vs Agent 2 TC04-TC05), column renaming (Agent 1 TC003 vs Agent 2 TC06-TC07), Snowflake loading (Agent 1 TC004 vs Agent 2 TC08-TC09), null handling (Agent 1 TC005 vs Agent 2 TC10), error handling (Agent 1 TC006 vs Agent 2 TC13-TC14), and performance testing (Agent 1 TC007 vs Agent 2 TC11). Agent 2 provides additional coverage for data integrity (TC12) and truncation behavior (TC15). The semantic intent is highly aligned but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both follow test case list + pytest script structure. Agent 1 uses numbered list format (TC001-TC008) with description/expected outcome pairs, followed by basic pytest functions. Agent 2 uses table format (TC01-TC15) with ID/Description/Expected Output columns, followed by sophisticated pytest implementation with fixtures (lines 8-25), helper functions (lines 27-35), and modular test design. Agent 1 has simpler linear structure while Agent 2 employs advanced pytest patterns with setup/teardown and parameterization concepts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,72,"Lines 3, 15, 25, 35","Pytest script has several syntax and implementation issues: incomplete import statement for etl_job module (line 3), basic assertions without proper setup, mocked Snowflake operations without actual validation logic (line 35), and missing error handling patterns. Test functions are functional but lack robustness and proper test isolation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 45, 67","Well-structured pytest implementation with proper fixtures, comprehensive test coverage, and good error handling. Minor issues include potential path hardcoding in some tests (line 45) and assumption about default column naming behavior (line 67). Overall syntax is correct with proper use of pytest patterns and PySpark operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,82,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting Agent 1's basic but functional implementation and Agent 2's sophisticated and robust approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,"Lines 3, 15, 25, 35","Enhance pytest implementation by adding proper fixtures for test isolation, implementing actual Snowflake connection testing instead of mocks, adding comprehensive error handling patterns, and expanding test coverage to include edge cases like empty files and data integrity validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,"Lines 45, 67","Consider parameterizing file paths to avoid hardcoding, add more explicit assertions for column naming behavior, and include integration test examples with actual Snowflake connectivity for production readiness."
