Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two ETL test case outputs for Matillion to Informatica conversion. Agent_1 provides 8 basic test cases with simple pytest implementation. Agent_2 delivers 15 comprehensive test cases with advanced pytest fixtures, better error handling, and more thorough coverage. Agent_2 demonstrates superior test design with proper setup/teardown, parameterization, and edge case coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50 vs 1-150,"Both outputs address ETL testing for the same conversion scenario (Matillion to Informatica). Core test concepts overlap: CSV reading, status filtering, column renaming, Snowflake loading, null handling, error scenarios. However Agent_2 expands significantly with additional edge cases (empty files, missing headers, performance testing, data integrity validation) that Agent_1 lacks. The fundamental intent aligns but Agent_2 provides broader semantic coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,60,Lines 1-30 vs 1-40,"Agent_1 uses simple numbered list format (TC001-TC008) followed by basic pytest functions. Agent_2 employs structured table format (TC01-TC15) with comprehensive pytest implementation including fixtures, helper functions, and proper test organization. Both follow test case -> pytest script structure but Agent_2 demonstrates superior architectural approach with reusable components and better separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,Lines 31-50,"Agent_1 pytest script has valid Python syntax but contains several issues: hardcoded file paths without proper handling, missing imports for actual ETL functions, incomplete Snowflake mocking, and basic assertions. The script would require significant modification to run successfully in a real environment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 41-150,"Agent_2 pytest script demonstrates excellent syntax and structure with proper fixtures, temporary file handling, comprehensive imports, realistic mocking strategies, and robust error handling. Minor deduction for some mock implementations that could be more realistic, but overall represents production-ready test code."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Agent_2 significantly outperforms Agent_1 in syntactic correctness and implementation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Enhance test coverage by adding edge cases like empty files and missing headers. Implement proper pytest fixtures for better test isolation. Add comprehensive error handling scenarios. Improve Snowflake mocking with realistic connection simulation. Consider performance testing for large datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider adding more specific business logic validation tests. Enhance Snowflake connector mocking to be more realistic. Add integration test scenarios alongside unit tests. Consider adding test data generation utilities for better maintainability."
