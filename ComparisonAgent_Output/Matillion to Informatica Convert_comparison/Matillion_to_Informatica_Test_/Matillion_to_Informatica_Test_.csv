Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent Output 1 provides 8 basic test cases with a simple pytest implementation for ETL validation. Agent Output 2 delivers 15 comprehensive test cases in structured table format with robust pytest scripts including fixtures, error handling, and edge cases. Both outputs address core ETL testing requirements but differ significantly in depth and implementation quality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-8 (Agent 1), Lines 1-15 (Agent 2)","Both outputs target the same ETL validation goals: CSV reading, status filtering, column renaming, Snowflake loading, and error handling. Agent 2 provides broader coverage with additional edge cases like empty files, missing headers, and connection failures. Core intent alignment is strong but Agent 2 demonstrates deeper understanding of testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 9-50 (Agent 1), Lines 17-200 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses simple list format followed by basic pytest script. Agent 2 employs structured table format with comprehensive pytest implementation including fixtures, helper functions, and modular test design. Both follow pytest conventions but Agent 2 shows superior organization and professional structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 1,72,"Lines 15, 23, 35, 42","Syntax is generally valid but has issues: Line 15 imports undefined 'etl_job' module, Line 23 uses hardcoded file paths without proper setup, Line 35 lacks proper Snowflake mocking, Line 42 has incomplete exception handling. Basic pytest structure is correct but implementation has gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 2,94,"Lines 25, 180","Excellent syntax and structure with proper fixtures, error handling, and modular design. Minor issues: Line 25 could use more specific exception types, Line 180 simulation could be more realistic. Overall implementation is professional-grade with comprehensive test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,83,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (72 + 94) / 2 = 83. Agent 2 significantly outperforms Agent 1 in implementation quality and completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 1,,"Improve pytest implementation by adding proper fixtures for test data setup, implement realistic Snowflake connection mocking, add comprehensive error handling, and expand test coverage to include edge cases like empty files and missing columns."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 2,,"Enhance exception specificity in error handling tests, add more realistic Snowflake connection simulation, consider adding integration test examples, and include performance benchmarking assertions with specific thresholds."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from adding test data validation, implementing proper CI/CD integration examples, adding logging verification tests, and including documentation for test setup and execution procedures."
