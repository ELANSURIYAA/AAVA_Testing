Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-49","Comparison of two ECL program dependency mapping outputs reveals significant structural and semantic differences. Agent 1 provides detailed granular dependencies with 43 specific File_* references across multiple ECL programs, while Agent 2 uses simplified high-level AACT references or empty arrays. Both outputs are syntactically valid JSON but represent fundamentally different approaches to dependency analysis - detailed vs. simplified mapping strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,"Lines 1-49","Major semantic divergence detected. Agent 1 interprets the task as requiring detailed file-level dependency mapping with specific references to individual data files (File_Clinical_Study, File_Arm_Groups, etc.). Agent 2 interprets the same task as requiring high-level logical grouping under 'AACT' umbrella or no dependencies. Both address dependency mapping but with completely different granularity and scope assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-49","High structural similarity in JSON format and key structure. Both use identical ECL file names as keys (spray_data.ecl, Analyze_Broken_File.ecl, ARM_ID_Analysis.ecl, NCT_ID_Analysis.ecl, Review_Data.ecl, Review_raw_data.ecl, Select_Report.ecl). Array value structure is consistent. Primary difference is in array content depth and specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,"Lines 1-49","Perfect JSON syntax validation. All brackets, braces, and quotes properly matched. Valid array structures with consistent string elements. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-49","Perfect JSON syntax validation. All brackets, braces, and quotes properly matched. Valid array structures with consistent string elements and empty arrays. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-49","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid JSON structure and formatting."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 3-8, 10-48","Strength: Provides comprehensive detailed dependency mapping with 43 specific file references. Consider: Validate that all referenced files actually exist in the target system. Ensure dependency accuracy through cross-referencing with actual ECL program imports."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 3-8, 10-48","Strength: Clean simplified approach with logical high-level grouping. Consider: May be too simplified for detailed dependency analysis needs. Empty arrays for spray_data.ecl and Review_raw_data.ecl may indicate missing dependency detection. Recommend validation of whether these programs truly have no dependencies."
