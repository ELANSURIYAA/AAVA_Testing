Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-44,"Two JSON outputs mapping ECL programs to dependencies. Agent_1_Output provides comprehensive dependency mapping with detailed file references, while Agent_2_Output provides simplified mapping with generic AACT references or empty arrays. Significant semantic divergence in dependency granularity and specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,25,Lines 1-44,"Both outputs address ECL program dependency mapping but with fundamentally different approaches. Agent_1_Output provides granular, specific dependencies (e.g., File_Clinical_Study, File_Arm_Groups), while Agent_2_Output uses generic AACT references or empty arrays. The semantic intent differs significantly - detailed vs. simplified mapping."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-44,"Both outputs follow identical JSON structure with same key names (spray_data.ecl, Analyze_Broken_File.ecl, etc.) and array value format. Only difference is in array content depth and specificity. Structure is nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,100,Lines 1-44,"Valid JSON syntax with proper key-value pairs, correctly formatted arrays, and consistent string formatting. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,100,Lines 1-44,"Valid JSON syntax with proper key-value pairs, correctly formatted arrays, and consistent string formatting. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,Lines 1-44,"Both outputs are syntactically correct JSON with no formatting or structural errors."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 1-44,"Maintain detailed dependency mapping approach as it provides comprehensive visibility into ECL program relationships and dependencies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 1-44,"Consider expanding dependency detail to match the granularity of Agent_1_Output for better program analysis and dependency management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-44,"Establish clear requirements for dependency mapping granularity. If detailed analysis is needed, use Agent_1_Output approach. If simplified overview suffices, Agent_2_Output approach is adequate."
