Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents successfully analyzed Airflow DAG parameters with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (85/100). DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent2 provides more comprehensive coverage with location details and additional sections, while DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent1 offers a more concise presentation. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the identical core task of analyzing Airflow DAG parameters. They cover the same fundamental parameter categories: DAG configuration, source connections (GCS and Oracle), BigQuery destination, data transfer settings, and error handling. The parameter values and descriptions are semantically equivalent. Minor differences include Agent2's additional sections (8-9) for external parameters and task grouping, and more detailed location information. The core intent and meaning are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both follow hierarchical numbered section structure with bullet points for parameters. Agent1 uses 7 main sections while Agent2 uses 9 sections. Both use consistent markdown formatting with headers, bullet points, and code blocks. Agent2 includes location information for each parameter (e.g., 'Location: DAG definition') and additional structural elements like task grouping section. The overall flow and organization are very similar despite these structural enhancements in Agent2."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent1,100,Lines 1-35,"Perfect markdown syntax with proper headers (#, ##), consistent bullet point formatting, valid parameter names and values, proper code block formatting for schema fields, and no syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent2,100,Lines 1-50,"Excellent markdown syntax with proper headers, consistent formatting, valid parameter names, proper code block formatting, detailed location references, and no syntax errors. Additional structural elements like task grouping are properly formatted."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent1,N/A,Lines 1-35,"Consider adding location information for parameters to improve traceability and debugging. Add sections for external parameters and task grouping for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DAG_Parameter_Extractor_Agent2,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding a summary table of all parameters for quick reference. The detailed location information is very valuable for developers."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide valuable DAG parameter analysis. Agent2's approach with location details and additional sections provides better developer experience, while Agent1's concise format may be preferred for quick reference. Consider combining the conciseness of Agent1 with the detailed location information of Agent2 for optimal results."
