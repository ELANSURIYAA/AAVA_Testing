Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-25,"Two verification summaries for SAS code auditing with identical structural format but dramatically different completeness levels. Agent1 reports complete evaluation (25/25 rules) while Agent2 reports incomplete evaluation (2/25 rules). Both agents demonstrate accurate evaluation methodology for the rules they assessed."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,1-25,"Both outputs serve the same fundamental purpose of verifying SAS code audit completeness and accuracy. They follow identical semantic intent: summarizing total rules, evaluated rules, missing evaluations, incorrect evaluations, recommendation quality, and overall assessment. However, they diverge significantly in the scope of work completed - Agent1 claims complete coverage while Agent2 acknowledges substantial gaps. The semantic alignment is strong in methodology but differs in execution completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,1-25,"Nearly identical structural organization with same section headers: Verification Summary (lines 2-5), Missing Evaluations (lines 7-8), Incorrect Evaluations (lines 10-11), Recommendation Quality (lines 13-14), and Overall Assessment (lines 16-17). Both use bullet-point format for numerical summaries and paragraph format for qualitative assessments. Minor structural difference: Agent2 includes detailed enumeration of missing audit IDs (line 9) while Agent1 simply states 'None'."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,100,,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and well-formed bullet points. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,100,,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-formed structure. Code blocks properly formatted with triple backticks. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper formatting and internal consistency. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,1-25,"Maintain current comprehensive evaluation approach. Consider adding more detailed line-by-line analysis for transparency. Document methodology used to achieve complete coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,1-25,"Complete the remaining 23 audit rule evaluations to provide comprehensive coverage. Maintain current accuracy and recommendation quality standards. Consider implementing systematic checklist to prevent missing evaluations in future assessments."
