Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs are SAS code audit reports for similar file names (tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas vs tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4). tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas provides complete audit results with 25 audits all failing, while tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4 shows incomplete results with only 2 detailed audits but claims different pass/fail rates. Both follow similar structural patterns but differ significantly in completeness and accuracy of reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-15,"Both outputs address SAS code auditing with identical category structures and similar audit naming conventions. However tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4 shows inconsistent metrics (claims 25 audits but only details 2) while tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas provides complete audit coverage. The semantic intent is aligned but execution differs substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural patterns: Categories List, Global Counts table, Category-Level Counts table, and Audit Details sections. The markdown table formatting and section headers are consistent. Minor differences include tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4 using 'SAS_Best_Practices_Audit_Table.txt' terminology and adding extra categorization fields."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas,95,Lines 16-50,"Structurally sound with consistent data presentation. All 25 audits properly referenced with complete details. Tables are well-formatted and data is internally consistent. Minor issue: truncated audit details section (shows '... Repeat for all 25 audits')."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4,60,Lines 16-45,"Contains significant inconsistencies: Claims 25 total audits but Global Counts show conflicting numbers (1 passed, 1 failed = 2 total, not 25). Category-Level Counts table shows zeros for most categories despite claiming totals. Only 2 audit details provided despite claiming 25 audits exist."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,78,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores (95 + 60) / 2 = 77.5, rounded to 78."

Recommendations,Recommendation,tcm_rpt_macro_lib_fileprep.sas___fd15up4,N/A,Lines 16-45,"Critical: Fix data inconsistencies between claimed totals (25 audits) and actual detailed content (2 audits). Correct Global Counts metrics to reflect actual audit coverage. Complete all 25 audit details as promised in the summary. Remove confusing 'SAS_Best_Practices_Audit_Table.txt' terminology that obscures the actual audit subject matter."
