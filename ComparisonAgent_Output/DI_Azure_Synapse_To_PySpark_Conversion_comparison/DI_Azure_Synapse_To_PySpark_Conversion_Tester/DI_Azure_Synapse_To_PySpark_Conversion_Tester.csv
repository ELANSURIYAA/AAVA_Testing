Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both agents successfully converted Azure Synapse stored procedure to Databricks PySpark with comprehensive test validation. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_comparison provides more detailed transformation mapping while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_Tester offers more concise presentation. Both include complete pytest implementations with 10 test cases covering happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core conversion task with similar business logic handling (income_amount NULL/negative to 0), dimensional joins, and test coverage. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_comparison provides more detailed expression transformation mapping (lines 8-15) while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_Tester focuses on concise test descriptions (lines 12-21). Both cover identical test scenarios but with different levels of detail in explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both follow similar high-level organization: transformation changes, manual interventions, test cases, pytest scripts. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_comparison uses more detailed subsections with explicit transformation categories (lines 8-25) and extensive manual intervention recommendations (lines 27-35). DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_Tester presents cleaner table formatting (lines 12-21) and more streamlined section organization. Both include 10 test cases with similar pytest structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_comparison,95,,"Well-formed document with proper syntax throughout. Complete pytest implementation with proper imports, fixtures, and test functions (lines 45-200). Consistent variable naming and proper exception handling. Minor issue: some test functions could benefit from more specific assertion messages."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_Tester,92,,"Good overall structure with valid pytest syntax. Complete test implementation with proper fixtures and helper functions (lines 35-180). Minor inconsistencies: test case descriptions in table don't perfectly match pytest function names, and some error handling could be more specific (lines 165-175)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python/pytest code, proper markdown formatting, and consistent internal references. Average of individual scores reflects minor issues in test case alignment and assertion specificity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_comparison,,"Strengthen test assertion messages for better debugging. Consider adding more specific error type expectations in exception tests. Maintain the detailed transformation mapping approach as it provides valuable context for developers."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Conversion_Tester,,"Align test case table descriptions with actual pytest function names for consistency. Add more detailed error handling in edge case tests. The concise presentation style is effective but could benefit from slightly more technical detail in transformation explanations."
