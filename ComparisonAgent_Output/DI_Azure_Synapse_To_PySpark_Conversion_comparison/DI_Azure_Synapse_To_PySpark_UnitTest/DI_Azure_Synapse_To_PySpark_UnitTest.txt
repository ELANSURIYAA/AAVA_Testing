# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent comparison of two pytest scripts for Databricks PySpark ETL validation. Agent 1 provides incomplete implementation (truncated at line 27) while Agent 2 delivers complete, production-ready test suite with 10 comprehensive test cases covering happy path, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both agents target identical goal: pytest validation of FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY ETL process. Same business logic focus on income_amount transformations (NULL/negative to 0), dimensional joins, and data quality validation. Agent 2 expands with additional test scenarios (duplicates, large datasets, missing dimensions) that Agent 1 likely intended but didn't complete due to truncation.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both follow pytest conventions with fixtures, test functions, and similar naming patterns. Agent 2 demonstrates superior structure with centralized ETL function, comprehensive schema definitions, and consistent test data patterns. Agent 1 shows similar architectural intent but incomplete implementation prevents full structural assessment.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 45/100)**
- Incomplete implementation with syntax errors at lines 27-30
- Malformed schema definition with unmatched braces and missing fields
- Code truncation prevents execution and validation of intended functionality

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100)**
- Nearly complete implementation with proper PySpark syntax
- Valid schema definitions and executable test cases (lines 45-50, 85-90)
- Minor deduction for potential optimization opportunities in join operations

**Overall Correctness: 70/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 45 | 95 | 70 |
| **Overall** | **68** | **85** | **77** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
- Complete the truncated implementation by finishing the schema definition and adding remaining test cases
- Fix syntax errors in fixture setup and ensure proper table creation logic

**For Agent 2:**
- Consider adding more specific error assertions and performance benchmarking
- Enhance documentation for complex join operations and add data validation helpers for reusability

**For Both:**
- Standardize on Agent 2's architectural approach with centralized ETL function and comprehensive test coverage
- Implement continuous integration hooks and add data lineage validation for production deployment
