Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Azure Synapse to PySpark conversion with high accuracy. AAVA_Review_Agent focuses on validation and optimization while AAVA_Conversion_Agent emphasizes testing and reconciliation. Both maintain business logic integrity and provide actionable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Azure Synapse stored procedure conversion to PySpark. They share identical understanding of business requirements, data flow preservation, and dimensional joins. Minor differences in emphasis: AAVA_Review_Agent prioritizes performance optimization while AAVA_Conversion_Agent emphasizes testing validation. Both correctly identify the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY procedure conversion with STG_HOLDING_METRICS source and four dimension table joins."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-200,"Both follow similar analytical structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Optimization Suggestions, and Cost Estimation. AAVA_Review_Agent uses more detailed subsections (Data Source Mapping, Join Logic Preservation, Business Rule Implementation) while AAVA_Conversion_Agent provides consolidated accuracy assessment. Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations. Structural differences in granularity but consistent overall approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Review_Agent,95,Lines 1-100,"Syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. All SQL to PySpark mappings are correctly identified. Business rule transformations (CASE WHEN to when().otherwise()) are accurately described. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points but no syntax errors."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Conversion_Agent,93,Lines 1-100,"Well-structured with accurate technical content and proper documentation format. Correct identification of all conversion elements including DataFrame operations, caching strategies, and error handling. Minor inconsistency in cost breakdown formatting but overall syntactically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,Lines 1-200,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical terminology, proper formatting, and consistent internal references. No broken links or undefined terms identified."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Review_Agent,Lines 51-80,"Strengthen performance optimization sections with specific Spark configuration parameters. Add more detailed memory management guidelines. Consider including data lineage documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Conversion_Agent,Lines 51-80,"Enhance test coverage documentation with specific test case examples. Add more detailed reconciliation validation steps. Consider including schema evolution handling procedures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,Lines 1-200,"Both agents provide valuable complementary perspectives. AAVA_Review_Agent excels in technical optimization while AAVA_Conversion_Agent provides superior testing framework. Combining both approaches would create comprehensive conversion documentation. Consider standardizing cost estimation methodology across both agents."
