AAVA_Review_Agent focuses on validation and optimization while AAVA_Conversion_Agent emphasizes testing and reconciliation. Both maintain business logic integrity and provide actionable recommendations for the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure conversion.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Azure Synapse stored procedure conversion to PySpark with remarkable consistency. They demonstrate identical understanding of:

- Business requirements for loading FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY table
- Data flow preservation from STG_HOLDING_METRICS source
- Four-table dimensional joins (DIM_DATE, DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT)
- Critical business rule for income_amount validation (NULL/negative handling)

**Key Differences:**
- AAVA_Review_Agent prioritizes performance optimization and caching strategies
- AAVA_Conversion_Agent emphasizes comprehensive testing frameworks and reconciliation
- Both correctly identify the same technical conversion patterns but with different analytical depth
