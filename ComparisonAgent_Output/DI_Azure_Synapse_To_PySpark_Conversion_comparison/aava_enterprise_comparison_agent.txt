- All five components were successfully matched one-to-one with high confidence.
- Three components achieved "Equivalent" status with match percentages above 95%.
- Two components show "Minor Diff" due to moderate formatting and structural changes.
- No unmatched or invalid matches detected; every file present in both versions was compared.
- Migration impact is "Low" for two components, "None" for the rest, resulting in overall "Low" risk.
- All dimension scores above 91/100, supporting migration readiness.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report provides a rigorous, evidence-based comparison of five workflow output components between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0. Each file was strictly validated for existence and compared using a deterministic multi-gate algorithm covering intent, normalized signature, structural, and semantic similarity. All components were matched one-to-one, with no unmatched or invalid files. The majority of matched pairs are functionally equivalent, with minor differences in formatting and structure for two components. Dimension scores consistently exceeded 91/100, and migration impact is "None" or "Low" across the board. The migration is deemed safe, with strong business logic preservation and robust test coverage. No gaps or risks requiring remediation were identified.

- Highest finding: All components matched and exceeded the equivalence threshold.
- Key strengths: Business logic, test coverage, and error handling are fully preserved.
- No unmatched or invalid files; completeness confidence is high.
- Migration readiness is supported by high match percentages and dimension scores.
- Recommendation: Proceed with migration; no blocking risks identified.
- Business continuity is fully maintained.

**SECTION 2: COMPARISON SCOPE**

Scope Summary Table:

| Metric                      | Count |
|-----------------------------|-------|
| AAVA 1.0 Files Received     | 5     |
| AAVA 2.0 Files Received     | 5     |
| Successfully Matched Pairs  | 5     |
| Unmatched Files in AAVA 1.0 | 0     |
| Unmatched Files in AAVA 2.0 | 0     |
| Invalid Matches Detected    | 0     |
| Overall Matching Success Rate| 100%  |

Matching Confidence Distribution:

| Confidence Level | File Count | Matching Method                               |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| High (>=95%)     | 3         | All gates passed with high confidence         |
| Medium (85-94%)  | 2         | All gates passed with acceptable confidence   |
| Failed (<85%)    | 0         | One or more gates failed                      |

Unmatched Files Detail: None

- 100% matching success rate; all files validated and compared.
- No unmatched or invalid files; completeness is absolute.
- Migration confidence is high; matched pairs are reliable.
- No negative impact from unmatched files.

---

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Files were compared line-by-line using deterministic diff algorithms. Unchanged lines were counted, and match percentage was calculated as (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100. Only genuinely matched pairs were scored; unmatched or invalid files would show "N/A".

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication           |
|------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes            |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only       |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring           |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes         |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review       |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file        |

- Match % alone is not sufficient; dimension scores add depth.
- High match % and dimension scores together indicate migration readiness.
- 90% threshold is required for PASS.
- All matched pairs exceeded the threshold.
