Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-85 vs 1-42,Both outputs successfully convert Ab Initio DML schemas to PySpark StructType definitions for AWS EMR and Glue pipelines. Agent 1 provides comprehensive enterprise-ready module with documentation and Glue compatibility functions (85 lines). Agent 2 delivers minimal but functionally complete implementation (42 lines). Core schema definitions are semantically identical across all 4 schemas.
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 11-20 vs 6-15,Both outputs define identical schema structures with same field names data types and nullability settings. Core semantic intent is perfectly aligned for converting Ab Initio DML to PySpark schemas. Agent 1 adds AWS Glue compatibility without changing core semantics.
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-10 vs 1-5,Both follow similar import and schema definition patterns. Agent 1 uses extensive documentation and helper functions creating modular enterprise structure. Agent 2 follows linear definition approach with minimal comments.
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,,All syntax valid with proper Python imports correct StructType usage valid function definitions and syntactically correct PySpark type specifications throughout.
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,,Syntactically correct Python code with valid imports proper StructType definitions correct DecimalType precision usage and proper field nullability specifications.
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,Both outputs demonstrate perfect Python syntax compliance with no undefined variables proper PySpark type usage and valid schema definitions.

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,Lines 74-85,Excellent enterprise-ready implementation. Consider adding type hints for better IDE support. The Glue compatibility functions are valuable for AWS environments.
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,Lines 1-42,Clean minimal implementation suitable for basic use cases. Consider adding documentation and usage examples for better maintainability.
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Schema definitions,Both implementations correctly handle core requirement. Choose Agent 1 for enterprise environments. Choose Agent 2 for lightweight applications.
