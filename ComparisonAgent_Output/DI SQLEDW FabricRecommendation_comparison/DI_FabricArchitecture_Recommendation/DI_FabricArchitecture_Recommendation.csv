Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Agent_Brief_Thought provides meta-commentary on analysis readiness while Agent_Comprehensive_Report delivers a complete 300+ line Microsoft Fabric migration strategy. Semantic alignment is minimal (15/100) as they serve different purposes. Structural similarity is low (10/100) due to vastly different formats. Agent_Brief_Thought has syntax issues (70/100) while Agent_Comprehensive_Report demonstrates excellent technical documentation quality (95/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-300+,"Agent_Brief_Thought focuses on process meta-analysis stating readiness to produce a report while Agent_Comprehensive_Report provides the actual comprehensive Microsoft Fabric architecture and migration recommendations. The semantic disconnect is substantial - one discusses capability while the other demonstrates execution. Only minimal conceptual overlap exists around the general topic of analysis and reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-300+,"Agent_Brief_Thought uses simple thought-action format with 3 lines while Agent_Comprehensive_Report employs complex hierarchical Markdown structure with table of contents 9 major sections multiple subsections tables and diagrams. The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible - minimal linear format versus comprehensive technical documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Brief_Thought,70,Line 3,"Syntactically valid thought-action format but contains incomplete action specification 'Action: None (proceeding to final answer synthesis)' which suggests process interruption or placeholder content. The format follows expected patterns but lacks completion."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Comprehensive_Report,95,Lines 1-300+,"Excellent Markdown syntax with proper headers table formatting code blocks and hierarchical structure. Minor deduction for some table formatting inconsistencies and potential over-complexity in certain sections but overall demonstrates high technical writing quality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,82,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (70 + 95) / 2 = 82.5 rounded to 82."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Brief_Thought,N/A,Line 3,"Complete the interrupted process by providing the actual deliverable rather than meta-commentary. The thought process should lead to concrete output generation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Comprehensive_Report,N/A,Lines 50-100,"Excellent comprehensive coverage. Consider adding more specific implementation timelines and cost estimates. Some tables could benefit from more consistent formatting for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"These outputs serve different purposes in a workflow - Agent_Brief_Thought appears to be process documentation while Agent_Comprehensive_Report is the deliverable. For comparison purposes ensure both agents are producing comparable output types (both deliverables or both process documentation)."
