Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-300+","Both outputs provide comprehensive SQL Server EDW optimization analyses with identical structural approaches, semantic alignment, and high-quality documentation standards. The reports analyze SSIS packages, SSRS reports, and EDW schema usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 280-300","Both outputs address identical objectives of SQL Server EDW optimization through redundant object identification. Core analysis covers same components: SSIS packages, SSRS RDL files, and EDW schema. Minor differences in phrasing and emphasis on specific optimization aspects (Output 1 emphasizes 'unused' objects more explicitly, Output 2 focuses on 'redundant' objects). Both reach same conclusions about dmproc tables being unused and dimension tables being SSIS-only."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,98,"Lines 1-300+","Nearly identical document structure with same section hierarchy: Introduction, Usage Analysis, Categorization, Recommendations, Conclusion. Both use identical categorization framework with same table structures. Output 1 includes additional subsections in categorization (Tables used as Source/Target/Lookup in multiple packages) that Output 2 consolidates. Both maintain consistent logical flow and decomposition approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,100,"Lines 1-300+","Proper markdown syntax throughout, consistent table formatting, valid internal structure, no broken references or syntax errors. All categorization tables properly formatted with consistent column headers and data alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,100,"Lines 1-300+","Proper markdown syntax throughout, consistent table formatting, valid internal structure, no broken references or syntax errors. All categorization tables properly formatted with consistent column headers and data alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,,"Lines 280-295","Focus on consolidating ELT logic, optimizing lookups, and standardizing batch processing. Emphasizes technical implementation aspects like shared/parameterized packages and centralized lookup caching."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,,"Lines 260-280","Emphasizes archiving unused objects, documenting data lineage, and governance aspects. More strategic focus on business stakeholder validation and compliance considerations before removing objects."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 260-300","Both provide actionable EDW optimization recommendations. Output1 leans toward technical ETL optimizations while Output2 emphasizes governance and strategic data management. Combined approach would be most comprehensive."
