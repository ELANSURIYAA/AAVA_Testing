Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison between DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases (comprehensive unit test framework) and Missing_KB_Excel (error response due to missing dependency). Significant divergence in output completeness and utility."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-200 vs Line 1,"DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases delivers comprehensive unit test framework addressing pipeline testing requirements with detailed test cases, validation queries, sample data, and execution scripts. Missing_KB_Excel provides only error message about missing Knowledge Base Excel file. Semantic alignment is minimal - both acknowledge the task context but only DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases fulfills the actual requirement."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-200 vs Line 1,"DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases follows structured documentation format with sections for test cases, sample data, execution scripts, and coverage summary. Missing_KB_Excel has no comparable structure - single sentence error message. Structural approaches are fundamentally different with no meaningful overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases,95,Lines 15-25,"Well-formed markdown with proper syntax, valid SQL queries, correct PowerShell syntax, and consistent CSV formatting. Minor issue: Line 25 contains placeholder 'yourResourceGroup' and 'yourADF' which should be parameterized or documented as template values."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Missing_KB_Excel,100,Line 1,"Syntactically correct single sentence response. Grammar and punctuation are proper. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_AzureDataFactory_UnitTestCases,N/A,Lines 15-25,"Replace placeholder values with proper parameterization or template documentation. Consider adding error handling examples for edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Missing_KB_Excel,N/A,Line 1,"Implement fallback mechanisms or alternative approaches when dependencies are missing. Provide partial output or template-based responses rather than complete failure."
