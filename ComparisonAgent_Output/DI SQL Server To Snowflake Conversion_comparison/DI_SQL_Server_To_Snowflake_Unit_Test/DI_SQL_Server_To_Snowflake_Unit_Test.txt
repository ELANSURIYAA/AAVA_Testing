# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation with similar semantic goals but different implementation sophistication levels. Agent 2 demonstrates superior Snowflake-specific practices while Agent 1 offers a more straightforward approach.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address identical testing objectives for Employee backup validation. They cover the same core scenarios: happy path testing, empty table handling, inner join validation, NULL value processing, and multiple record scenarios. The fundamental intent and business logic understanding are highly aligned, with only minor differences in test case naming and organization.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with test case documentation followed by Pytest implementation. However, Agent 2 uses more sophisticated Snowflake constructs including stored procedures (lines 95-108), proper error handling patterns, and module-level fixtures. Agent 1 uses a more direct SQL execution approach with function-level fixtures.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 78/100)**
- Lines 95-108, 145-150: Agent 1 has several Snowflake compatibility issues: uses basic CREATE TABLE and INSERT without proper Snowflake syntax considerations, lacks proper stored procedure structure for conditional logic, and has potential issues with the run_backup_script function implementation that may not work correctly in Snowflake environment.

**Agent 2 (Score: 92/100)**
- Lines 95-108, 125-140: Agent 2 demonstrates superior Snowflake syntax compliance with proper stored procedure structure using BEGIN/END blocks, DECLARE statements, and conditional IF/THEN/ELSE logic. Minor deduction for some complexity in error handling that could be simplified.

**Overall Correctness: 85/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 78 | 92 | 85 |
| **Overall** | **79** | **84** | **82** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1 (Lines 95-108):**
- Agent 1 should adopt proper Snowflake stored procedure syntax for conditional logic and improve error handling patterns to match Snowflake best practices.

**For Agent 2 (Lines 125-140):**
- Agent 2 could simplify some error handling logic while maintaining robustness, and consider adding more detailed performance testing scenarios.

**For Both Agents:**
- Both outputs would benefit from additional edge case testing such as data type validation, constraint violation handling, and concurrent execution scenarios.
