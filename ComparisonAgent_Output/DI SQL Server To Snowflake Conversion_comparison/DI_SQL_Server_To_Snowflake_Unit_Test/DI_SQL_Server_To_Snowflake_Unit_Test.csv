Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive Pytest test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Agent_1 focuses on direct SQL execution with 8 test cases covering core functionality, while Agent_2 provides a more robust approach with 9 test cases including error handling and performance testing. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with proper Snowflake syntax and pytest structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both agents address the same core objective of testing Employee backup table creation and validation in Snowflake. They share similar test scenarios (empty tables, inner joins, NULL handling, multiple records) but Agent_2 extends the scope with error handling (TC07) and performance testing (TC09). The fundamental understanding of the backup logic is consistent between both agents."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: header with metadata, numbered test case list, and complete Pytest implementation. However, Agent_1 uses a more straightforward approach with direct SQL execution in run_backup_script(), while Agent_2 implements a more sophisticated approach with stored procedure-like syntax using BEGIN/END blocks and variable declarations (lines 85-98). Agent_1 has 8 test cases vs Agent_2's 9 test cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 45-47, 89-91","Minor syntax issues: setup functions use %s placeholders which may not be optimal for Snowflake connector. The run_backup_script function correctly implements the backup logic but could benefit from better error handling. Overall structure and pytest syntax are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 85-98, 103-107","Uses more complex Snowflake syntax with BEGIN/END blocks and variable declarations which may not be supported in all Snowflake environments. The DECLARE and IF statements (lines 89-94) use advanced Snowflake features that require specific privileges. Some test assertions could be more robust."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both agents demonstrate strong technical competency with proper pytest structure, Snowflake connection handling, and comprehensive test coverage. Minor syntax and implementation approach differences prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider adding error handling test cases similar to Agent_2's TC07 and TC08. Implement performance testing for large datasets. Review Snowflake connector parameter usage for better compatibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Simplify the Snowflake script syntax to use more universally supported features instead of advanced stored procedure syntax. Consider breaking down complex test scenarios into smaller, more focused test cases. Validate that BEGIN/END blocks work in target Snowflake environment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents should standardize on Snowflake connector best practices and ensure cross-environment compatibility. Consider adding data validation assertions beyond simple row counting. Implement proper logging and debugging capabilities for production use."
