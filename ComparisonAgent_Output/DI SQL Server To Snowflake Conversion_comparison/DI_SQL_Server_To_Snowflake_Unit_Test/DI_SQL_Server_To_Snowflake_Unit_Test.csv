Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive unit test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation with similar core functionality but different implementation approaches. Agent 1 (Ascendion_AVA_Output_1) provides 8 focused test cases with direct SQL execution, while Agent 2 (Ascendion_AVA_Output_2) offers 9 test cases with enhanced error handling and performance testing. Semantic alignment is strong (88/100) as both address the same business requirements. Structural similarity is moderate (75/100) due to different organizational patterns and script execution approaches. Correctness varies significantly - Agent 1 achieves high syntax validity (92/100) while Agent 2 has critical Snowflake syntax issues (65/100) affecting overall reliability."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment in addressing Employee backup table validation for Snowflake. Core test scenarios overlap significantly: happy path validation (TC01 in both), empty table handling (TC02/TC04), inner join logic (TC03/TC05), NULL value handling (TC04/TC06), and multiple record processing (TC07/TC01). Agent 2 introduces additional semantic value with error handling tests (TC03, TC07) and performance validation (TC09) not present in Agent 1. However, both maintain consistent focus on data integrity, join correctness, and edge case coverage. Minor semantic differences include Agent 1's explicit focus on table dropping scenarios (TC06) versus Agent 2's emphasis on graceful error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Structural organization shows moderate similarity with key differences in implementation approach. Both follow the pattern: header/description → test case list → Pytest implementation → cost calculation. Agent 1 uses direct SQL execution within Python functions (lines 45-70), while Agent 2 employs a centralized script execution model with stored procedure-like syntax (lines 85-105). Test fixture approaches differ: Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures with explicit cleanup (lines 25-35), Agent 2 uses module-scoped connection with autouse cleanup fixtures (lines 20-40). Helper function organization varies: Agent 1 provides granular setup functions (setup_employee_table, setup_salary_table), Agent 2 combines these with a unified script execution approach. Both maintain consistent test function naming conventions and assertion patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_1,92,"Lines 45-70, 85-120","Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with valid Python/Pytest syntax throughout. Snowflake connector usage is properly implemented with correct parameterized queries (lines 45-50, 60-65). Table creation and data insertion statements use valid Snowflake SQL syntax. Helper functions are well-formed with proper exception handling in fixtures (lines 30-35). Minor issues include potential connection parameter placeholders ('USER', 'PASSWORD') that would need runtime configuration (lines 15-20). Test assertions are syntactically correct with proper tuple comparisons (lines 95-100, 110-115). Overall structure maintains Python best practices with appropriate imports and function definitions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_2,65,"Lines 85-105, 125-140","Agent 2 contains significant syntax issues affecting Snowflake compatibility. The embedded SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT uses stored procedure syntax (BEGIN...DECLARE...IF...END) that is not standard Snowflake SQL (lines 85-105). Snowflake does not support traditional stored procedures with DECLARE statements in this format. The script attempts to use session variables (:employee_count) which requires different syntax in Snowflake. Python syntax is generally correct for Pytest implementation, but the core SQL script would fail in actual Snowflake execution. Error handling logic is well-implemented (lines 125-140), and fixture setup follows proper patterns. However, the fundamental SQL syntax incompatibility significantly impacts the correctness score."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,79,N/A,"Average correctness score reflects the significant disparity between agents. Agent 1's high syntax validity (92) is offset by Agent 2's critical SQL syntax issues (65), resulting in a moderate overall score. The 27-point difference highlights the importance of platform-specific syntax validation in database testing frameworks."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Output_1,N/A,"Lines 15-20, 30-35","Strengthen connection parameter management by implementing environment variable configuration instead of placeholder strings. Enhance error handling in fixtures to provide more detailed failure diagnostics. Consider adding performance benchmarks similar to Agent 2's TC09 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Output_2,N/A,"Lines 85-105, 125-140","Critical: Replace stored procedure syntax with standard Snowflake SQL. Remove DECLARE statements and use Snowflake-compatible conditional logic (CASE statements or separate queries). Validate all SQL syntax against Snowflake documentation before implementation. Consider adopting Agent 1's direct SQL execution approach for better compatibility."
