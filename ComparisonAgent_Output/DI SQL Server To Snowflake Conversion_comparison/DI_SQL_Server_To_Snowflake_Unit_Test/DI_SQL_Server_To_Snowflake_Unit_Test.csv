Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Agent_2 demonstrates superior error handling, performance testing, and Snowflake best practices with stored procedures, while Agent_1 offers a more straightforward approach with basic test coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs target the same Employee backup creation validation goal. Agent_1 covers 8 core test scenarios while Agent_2 extends to 9 scenarios including performance and error handling. Minor divergence in test scope and error handling approach reduces perfect alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"","Both follow test case list + pytest implementation structure. Agent_2 uses module-level fixtures (lines 45-49) and stored procedure approach (lines 95-110) while Agent_1 uses function-level fixtures (lines 45-58) and direct SQL execution. Different architectural approaches but similar overall flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 85-95, 110-125","Valid Python syntax and Snowflake SQL. Minor issues: run_backup_script function creates table unconditionally (line 85) then drops if empty, which could cause unnecessary overhead. Setup functions properly handle parameterized queries."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 95-110, 130-145","Excellent Python syntax and Snowflake compliance. Uses proper stored procedure syntax (lines 95-110) with BEGIN/END blocks and variable declarations. Robust error handling with ProgrammingError catching (lines 35-40). Minor complexity in script execution parsing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91.5,"","Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both demonstrate strong technical implementation with Agent_2 showing superior Snowflake best practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 85-95","Consider implementing stored procedure approach like Agent_2 for better Snowflake compliance. Add error handling for missing tables and performance testing scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 130-145","Excellent implementation. Consider simplifying script execution parsing logic for better maintainability. Add more granular assertions in some test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"","Both provide solid test coverage. Agent_2's approach with stored procedures and comprehensive error handling represents current Snowflake best practices and should be preferred for production use."
