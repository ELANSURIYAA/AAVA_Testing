Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive Snowflake unit testing solutions for employee backup validation with pytest frameworks. Output_1 delivers 8 focused test cases with clean implementation, while Output_2 provides 10 test cases including advanced scenarios like performance testing and error handling. Key differences include Output_2's tabular test case presentation, more sophisticated error handling, and additional edge cases. Both maintain high code quality and Snowflake compatibility."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 15-45, 80-120","Both outputs address identical core objectives: validating Snowflake employee backup creation logic through comprehensive test coverage. They share the same fundamental approach of testing table creation, data insertion, join operations, and edge cases. Minor semantic differences include Output_2's expanded scope with performance testing (TC08) and duplicate handling (TC09), while Output_1 focuses on core functionality. Both demonstrate clear understanding of the backup validation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 50-180","Structural approaches differ significantly in organization. Output_1 uses a linear test case list format followed by pytest implementation, while Output_2 employs a professional tabular format for test case documentation. Both follow similar pytest fixture patterns and helper function structures. Output_2 introduces more sophisticated setup functions and error handling blocks. The core pytest structure remains consistent with similar fixture usage and cleanup patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,92,"Lines 60-65, 85-90","Output_1 demonstrates excellent syntax correctness with valid Python pytest structure, proper Snowflake connector usage, and well-formed SQL statements. Minor issues include potential connection parameter exposure and simplified error handling. All test functions are properly structured with appropriate assertions and cleanup procedures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,94,"Lines 70-75, 95-100, 140-145","Output_2 shows superior syntax correctness with enhanced error handling, more robust connection management, and comprehensive exception handling blocks. The Snowflake script includes proper BEGIN/END blocks with exception handling. All pytest functions are well-structured with appropriate setup and teardown procedures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,"Lines 60-145","Both outputs demonstrate high correctness standards with valid Python syntax, proper pytest structure, and Snowflake-compatible SQL. Output_2 slightly exceeds Output_1 in error handling sophistication and code robustness, resulting in marginally higher overall correctness scores."
