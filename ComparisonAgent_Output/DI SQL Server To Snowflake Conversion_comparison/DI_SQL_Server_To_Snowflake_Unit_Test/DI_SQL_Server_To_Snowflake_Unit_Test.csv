Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents delivered comprehensive Pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup functionality. Agent 1 provides 8 focused test cases with direct SQL execution approach, while Agent 2 offers 9 test cases including performance testing and uses Snowflake stored procedure syntax. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of testing requirements with high semantic alignment (88/100) and good structural similarity (82/100). Agent 2 shows slightly better correctness due to more robust error handling and comprehensive edge case coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing Snowflake Employee backup table creation and population. They cover similar test scenarios: happy path validation, empty table handling, inner join logic, NULL value processing, and edge cases. Agent 1 focuses on 8 essential test cases while Agent 2 extends to 9 cases including performance testing (TC09) and more comprehensive error handling (TC07). The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor differences in test case granularity and coverage depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case documentation followed by complete Pytest implementation. However, they differ in implementation approach. Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures and direct SQL execution, while Agent 2 employs module-scoped fixtures and Snowflake stored procedure syntax with BEGIN/END blocks. Agent 2 demonstrates more sophisticated fixture management with autouse cleanup and better separation of concerns in helper functions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_1,92,Lines 45-47,"Agent 1 output shows strong syntactic correctness with proper Python syntax, valid Snowflake connector usage, and well-structured Pytest implementation. Minor issues include: potential connection parameter exposure in fixture (lines 45-47) and basic error handling. The SQL syntax is correct for direct execution approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_2,96,Lines 89-98,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with robust error handling, proper exception management, and comprehensive fixture design. The Snowflake stored procedure syntax in SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT (lines 89-98) is correctly implemented with proper BEGIN/END blocks and conditional logic. Performance testing implementation is well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with Agent 2 showing slightly superior implementation due to better error handling and more comprehensive edge case coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_1,N/A,Lines 45-47,"Consider implementing more robust error handling similar to Agent 2's approach. Add module-level fixtures for better test isolation. Include performance testing for large datasets. Enhance security by avoiding credential exposure in fixture setup."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Agent_2,N/A,Lines 89-98,"Excellent implementation overall. Consider adding more granular test cases for specific edge conditions covered in Agent 1. The stored procedure approach is more robust but may require additional Snowflake privileges for execution."
