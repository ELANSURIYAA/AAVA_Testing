Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200+ for both agents","Both agents provide comprehensive unit test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Agent 2 demonstrates superior error handling, performance testing, and Snowflake-specific syntax compliance with 9 test cases vs Agent 1's 8 cases. Both cover core functionality but Agent 2 includes advanced scenarios like missing table handling and performance benchmarking."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (test descriptions), Lines 51-200 (implementations)","Both outputs target the same core objective: validating Employee backup table creation and population logic. Agent 1 focuses on data integrity and join logic validation, while Agent 2 extends to error handling and performance scenarios. The semantic intent aligns strongly with 85% overlap, but Agent 2 includes additional dimensions (TC07-TC09) that Agent 1 lacks, representing enhanced testing scope rather than different understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 51-100 (fixtures), Lines 101-200 (test functions)","Both follow pytest structure with fixtures and test functions, but differ significantly in implementation approach. Agent 1 uses a procedural run_backup_script() function (lines 85-105) while Agent 2 uses a declarative SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant (lines 95-115). Agent 1 has simpler setup functions, Agent 2 includes sophisticated error handling and cleanup patterns. Overall flow is similar but execution strategies diverge notably."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Basic,88,"Lines 60-65 (connection setup), Lines 140-145 (assertion logic)","Agent 1 code is syntactically correct with proper Python/Pytest structure. Minor issues: hardcoded credentials in fixture (line 62), potential resource leak without proper connection cleanup in some test functions, and missing error handling for Snowflake connection failures. Test assertions are well-formed and logical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Advanced,95,"Lines 70-75 (error handling), Lines 120-125 (script execution)","Agent 2 demonstrates superior correctness with comprehensive error handling, proper resource management with context managers, and robust cleanup patterns. Includes try-catch blocks for ProgrammingError handling (lines 70-75), uses proper Snowflake scripting syntax with BEGIN/END blocks, and implements performance timing validation. Very minor issue: hardcoded timeout threshold in TC09 (line 180)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (88 + 95) / 2 = 91.5, rounded to 92"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Basic,,"Lines 62, 85-105","Enhance error handling and resource management. Add try-catch blocks around Snowflake operations, implement proper connection cleanup, and consider using context managers. Add validation for missing tables scenario (similar to Agent 2's TC03, TC07)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Advanced,,"Lines 95-115, 180","Excellent implementation overall. Consider parameterizing the performance timeout threshold instead of hardcoding 10 seconds. The SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT approach is more maintainable than Agent 1's procedural method."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Test coverage and approach","Agent 2 provides more comprehensive test coverage including error scenarios and performance validation. Agent 1's approach is simpler and more straightforward for basic validation needs. For production use, Agent 2's approach is recommended due to superior error handling and edge case coverage."
