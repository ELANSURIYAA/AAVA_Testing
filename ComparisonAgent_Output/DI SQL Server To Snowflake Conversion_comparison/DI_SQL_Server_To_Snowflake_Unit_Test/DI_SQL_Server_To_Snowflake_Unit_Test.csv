Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Pytest test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Agent_2_Enhanced demonstrates superior coverage with 9 test cases including performance testing and enhanced error handling, while Agent_1_Basic provides solid foundational testing with 8 test cases. Both maintain high code quality and follow Snowflake best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. They share 8 common test scenarios (TC01-TC08) with nearly identical semantic intent: happy path testing, empty table handling, inner join validation, NULL value processing, and error conditions. The primary semantic divergence occurs in Agent_2_Enhanced's addition of performance testing (TC09) and enhanced error handling approaches, representing a 15% semantic expansion rather than fundamental disagreement."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs follow identical high-level structure: header with author/description, numbered test case list with ID/description/input/expected output format, and complete Pytest implementation. However, structural differences emerge in implementation details: Agent_1_Basic uses function-scoped fixtures (line 18) while Agent_2_Enhanced uses module-scoped fixtures (line 25), different cleanup strategies (autouse fixture vs manual cleanup), and Agent_2_Enhanced includes procedural SQL blocks (lines 85-95) versus Agent_1_Basic's simpler conditional logic (lines 65-75)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Basic,92,18-25,"Minor syntax issue: fixture scope and cleanup implementation could be more robust. The connection management in lines 18-25 lacks comprehensive error handling for connection failures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Enhanced,95,85-95,"Excellent syntax quality with robust error handling. The procedural SQL block implementation (lines 85-95) properly handles Snowflake-specific syntax. Minor concern: the DECLARE/BEGIN block syntax may need verification for Snowflake compatibility."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python pytest syntax, proper Snowflake SQL structure, and consistent variable naming. Agent_2_Enhanced shows slightly superior error handling and Snowflake-specific implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Basic,N/A,18-25,"Enhance fixture management by implementing module-scoped connections and autouse cleanup fixtures for better test isolation and resource management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Basic,N/A,65-75,"Consider adding performance testing scenarios to validate script behavior with large datasets, similar to Agent_2_Enhanced's TC09 implementation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Enhanced,N/A,85-95,"Verify Snowflake compatibility of the procedural SQL DECLARE/BEGIN block syntax, as some Snowflake environments may have limitations with stored procedure syntax."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Enhanced,N/A,200-220,"The performance test timeout of 10 seconds may be too restrictive for some environments; consider making this configurable or environment-specific."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both implementations would benefit from parameterized testing to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. Consider using pytest.mark.parametrize for data-driven test scenarios."
