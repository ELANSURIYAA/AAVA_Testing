Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-70","Both outputs successfully address the task of creating Snowflake-compatible backup scripts for Employee master data. Agent 1 provides a comprehensive multi-step approach with extensive documentation and alternative implementation examples, while Agent 2 delivers a more concise solution using proper Snowflake Scripting. The core business logic is semantically equivalent, but structural approaches differ significantly. Agent 1 has a critical logical flaw in the unconditional DROP statement, while Agent 2 implements correct conditional logic."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-70","Both outputs demonstrate nearly identical understanding of the business requirements: creating a backup table for Employee data with conditional population based on source data availability. The join logic (Employee to Salary tables), column mappings, and data type conversions are semantically equivalent. Minor differences exist in commenting style and explanation depth, but the core intent and business logic alignment is excellent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-70","Agent 1 uses a sequential multi-step approach with separate SQL statements and extensive inline documentation, including both immediate execution steps and a commented Snowflake Scripting alternative. Agent 2 implements a proper Snowflake Scripting block with BEGIN...END structure, variable declarations, and conditional logic. While both follow logical CREATE-CHECK-INSERT/DROP flow, the implementation structures are fundamentally different - procedural comments vs. actual procedural code."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+ Output 1,90,"Line 43","Syntactically valid Snowflake SQL with proper DDL statements, data type mappings, and join syntax. However, contains a critical logical flaw: the unconditional DROP TABLE statement at line 43 would always execute after the INSERT, effectively negating the backup creation regardless of the conditional logic described in comments."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion AVA+ Output 2,100,,"Syntactically correct and logically sound Snowflake Scripting implementation. Proper variable declaration with DECLARE statement, correct conditional IF...THEN...ELSE logic, valid DDL and DML syntax, and appropriate control flow structure. No syntax errors or logical inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Average correctness score across both outputs. While both demonstrate strong SQL syntax knowledge and Snowflake compatibility, Agent 1's logical flaw significantly impacts practical usability despite excellent documentation and alternative approaches."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+ Output 1,,"Line 43","Remove or conditionally execute the DROP TABLE statement at line 43 to prevent unconditional deletion of the backup table. Consider implementing the commented Snowflake Scripting block as the primary solution rather than the multi-step approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion AVA+ Output 2,,,"Excellent implementation. Consider adding more inline documentation to match the comprehensiveness of Agent 1's explanatory comments. Minor enhancement: add error handling with TRY...CATCH blocks for production robustness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs would benefit from explicit schema qualification (e.g., database.schema.table_name) for production deployment. Consider adding logging or audit trail functionality to track backup operations. Agent 2's approach is recommended for implementation due to correct conditional logic, while Agent 1's documentation style should be adopted for maintainability."
