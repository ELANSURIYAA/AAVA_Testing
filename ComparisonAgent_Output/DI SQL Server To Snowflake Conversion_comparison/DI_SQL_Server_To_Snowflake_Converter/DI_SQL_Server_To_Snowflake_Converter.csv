Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs address the same core requirement: creating a Snowflake-compatible backup script for Employee master data. Agent 1 provides a manual multi-step approach with extensive documentation, while Agent 2 implements a complete procedural solution using Snowflake scripting. The key difference lies in execution approach - Agent 1 requires manual intervention for conditional logic, while Agent 2 provides an automated solution."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-40 (Agent 2)","Both outputs have identical semantic intent: create employee_bkup table and conditionally populate it based on Employee table contents. Both use the same table structure, data types, and JOIN logic. Minor semantic differences in error handling approach and automation level."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Lines 15-35 (Agent 1), Lines 15-35 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses a manual multi-step structure with separate queries, while Agent 2 uses a unified BEGIN...END block with procedural logic. Both follow the same logical flow: drop table, create table, conditional population. Different structural approaches to achieve the same outcome."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,75,"Lines 25-27, 35-37","Syntax is valid but incomplete. The conditional logic requires manual execution of different steps based on row count results. Lines 35-37 show a DROP statement that would always execute, which is incorrect logic. The script lacks proper automation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 15-30","Excellent Snowflake scripting syntax with proper variable declaration, conditional logic, and control flow. Minor issue: variable binding syntax ':employee_count' should be 'employee_count' in the IF condition (line 20)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,,"Agent 2 provides significantly better syntactic correctness with proper procedural logic, while Agent 1 has logical flaws in its conditional approach."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Implement proper Snowflake scripting blocks instead of manual multi-step approach. Remove the unconditional DROP statement at lines 35-37. Add proper error handling and transaction management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Fix the variable binding syntax in the IF condition (line 20). Consider adding explicit error handling with TRY...CATCH blocks. Add comments explaining the procedural logic for better maintainability."
