Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents produce Snowflake-compatible SQL scripts for creating Employee backup tables with conditional logic. Agent 2 demonstrates superior technical implementation using proper Snowflake scripting syntax, while Agent 1 provides more comprehensive documentation but has structural and syntax concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"","Both scripts address the identical goal of creating a conditional backup of Employee master data. The core logic, table structure, and business intent are nearly identical. Minor differences in approach (multi-step vs scripting block) but same underlying purpose and data transformation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Agent 1 uses a multi-step approach with separate queries and extensive comments (lines 1-70), while Agent 2 employs a unified Snowflake scripting block (lines 15-30). Same logical flow but different structural implementation - Agent 1 is procedural steps, Agent 2 is consolidated scripting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,78,"Lines 35-37, 42-44","Syntax concerns include: 1) Standalone DROP statement at line 42-44 that would always execute, potentially dropping the backup table incorrectly, 2) Multi-step approach requires manual execution coordination, 3) Comments suggest procedural IF logic but implementation uses separate steps"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,"Line 18","Minor syntax consideration: Variable declaration uses ':employee_count' syntax which is correct for Snowflake scripting. Overall excellent syntax with proper BEGIN...END block, DECLARE statement, and IF...ELSE control flow"
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,87,"","Average of individual agent scores: (78 + 95) / 2 = 86.5, rounded to 87"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,"Lines 42-44","Remove the standalone DROP statement that executes unconditionally. Consider consolidating into a single Snowflake scripting block for better maintainability and atomic execution."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Line 18","Excellent implementation. Consider adding more inline comments for documentation purposes to match the thoroughness of Agent 1's explanatory approach."
