Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs successfully convert SQL Server backup scripts to Snowflake-compatible syntax. Output 1 provides a manual multi-step approach with detailed comments about Snowflake limitations, while Output 2 implements proper Snowflake scripting with procedural logic. Output 2 demonstrates superior structural organization and Snowflake best practices, though both achieve the same functional goal."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same core requirement: creating a Snowflake-compatible backup script for Employee data. They share identical business logic for table creation, data population via JOIN, and conditional handling based on row count. Minor semantic differences exist in implementation approach - Output 1 uses manual steps while Output 2 uses integrated scripting."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-15, 25-35 (table creation), Lines 40-50 (data insertion)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: DROP-CREATE-POPULATE pattern. However, Output 1 uses a fragmented multi-step approach with separate queries, while Output 2 uses cohesive Snowflake scripting blocks. Table definitions are nearly identical. Control flow differs significantly - manual vs procedural."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,88,"Lines 25-27 (row count check), Lines 45-47 (conditional drop)","Syntax is valid but implementation has logical issues. The script suggests running separate queries manually, which breaks atomicity. The final DROP statement (lines 45-47) would always execute regardless of row count, contradicting the intended logic. Comments are extensive and helpful."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,95,"Lines 15-30 (scripting block)","Excellent Snowflake scripting syntax with proper variable declaration, conditional logic, and control flow. Minor deduction for missing explicit error handling, though the structure is sound. Uses appropriate Snowflake-specific constructs like DECLARE and INTO syntax."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate good understanding of Snowflake syntax and requirements, with Output 2 showing superior implementation practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,"Implement proper Snowflake scripting blocks instead of manual multi-step approach. Remove the unconditional DROP statement at the end. Consider using transactions for atomicity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,"Add explicit error handling with TRY-CATCH blocks. Consider adding logging for operational visibility. The current implementation represents Snowflake best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs should include schema qualification for production use. Consider parameterizing table names for reusability. Add performance considerations for large datasets."
