Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs successfully convert SQL Server logic to Snowflake-compatible scripts for creating employee backup tables. Agent 1 provides a comprehensive multi-approach solution with detailed documentation and fallback options, while Agent 2 delivers a streamlined implementation using Snowflake scripting. Both achieve the same functional goal with high semantic alignment but differ significantly in structural approach and implementation complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address the identical goal of creating a Snowflake-compatible employee backup script. They implement the same core logic: drop existing backup table, create new table structure, conditionally populate from Employee/Salary join, and handle empty table scenarios. The semantic intent, data transformations, and business outcomes are virtually identical. Minor deduction for Agent 1's additional complexity in approach documentation versus Agent 2's focused implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Significant structural differences exist. Agent 1 uses a multi-step procedural approach with separate queries and includes both pure SQL and Snowflake Scripting examples (lines 20-25, 45-65). Agent 2 employs a unified Snowflake scripting block with declarative variables and conditional logic (lines 18-35). Both follow the same logical flow: drop table, create table, conditional population, but implement different control structures and decomposition strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 20-25, 32""Agent 1 has minor syntax issues: the standalone DROP TABLE statement on line 32 would execute unconditionally, potentially causing errors. The multi-step approach requires manual execution coordination. However, the Snowflake Scripting example (lines 45-65) is syntactically correct. The pure SQL approach lacks proper conditional execution mechanism."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Line 21""Agent 2 demonstrates excellent Snowflake scripting syntax with proper variable declaration, conditional logic, and control flow. Minor deduction for missing explicit error handling, though the script structure is robust. The DECLARE and SELECT INTO syntax is correct for Snowflake scripting (line 21-22)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of Snowflake syntax and requirements, with Agent 2 showing slightly better implementation consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider consolidating the multi-step approach into a single Snowflake scripting block for better execution reliability. Remove the unconditional DROP statement on line 32 that could cause runtime errors. The comprehensive documentation is valuable but could be streamlined for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Add explicit error handling using TRY...CATCH blocks for production robustness. Consider adding more detailed comments explaining the Snowflake-specific syntax choices. The implementation is solid but could benefit from additional documentation for maintenance purposes."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both solutions successfully address the conversion requirements. Agent 2's approach is more suitable for automated execution, while Agent 1's comprehensive documentation makes it better for educational or reference purposes. Consider combining Agent 2's clean implementation with Agent 1's detailed documentation for an optimal solution."
