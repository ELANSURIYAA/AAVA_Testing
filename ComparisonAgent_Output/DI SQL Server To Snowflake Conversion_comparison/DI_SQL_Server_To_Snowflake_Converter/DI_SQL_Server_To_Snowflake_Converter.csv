Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs successfully convert SQL Server backup logic to Snowflake-compatible syntax. Approach_1 uses manual multi-step execution requiring user intervention, while Approach_2 implements proper Snowflake scripting with BEGIN/END blocks and procedural logic. Both achieve the same end goal but with different execution paradigms. Approach_2 demonstrates superior automation and enterprise readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business requirements: creating conditional employee backup tables with data from Employee and Salary tables. Core logic and data transformations are semantically equivalent. The 15-point deduction reflects different automation approaches - Approach_1 requires manual step execution while Approach_2 provides automated scripting."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both follow identical high-level structure: DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE, conditional population logic. However, Approach_1 uses separate manual steps (lines 19-21, 26-35, 39) while Approach_2 uses integrated Snowflake scripting blocks (lines 17-32). Control flow implementation differs significantly - manual vs automated execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Approach_1,95,39,"Syntactically valid Snowflake SQL with proper DDL/DML statements. Minor issue: Line 39 DROP TABLE statement would always execute regardless of condition in manual workflow, potentially causing unintended behavior. All other syntax is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Approach_2,100,N/A,"Perfect Snowflake scripting syntax with proper BEGIN/END blocks, variable declarations, and conditional logic. All statements are syntactically correct and properly structured for automated execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with only minor workflow logic issues in Approach_1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Approach_1,N/A,"Lines 19-39: Consider implementing proper Snowflake scripting blocks instead of manual multi-step execution. Add transaction handling for enterprise deployment. Include error handling mechanisms."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Approach_2,N/A,"Lines 17-32: Excellent use of Snowflake scripting. Consider adding TRY/CATCH blocks for comprehensive error handling. Add logging statements for audit trails in production environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Explicit schema qualification for table references, 2) Parameterization for reusability across environments, 3) Performance optimization for large datasets, 4) Documentation of rollback procedures."
