Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents successfully converted SQL Server backup script to Snowflake-compatible format. Agent 1 provides comprehensive documentation with multiple implementation approaches but lacks procedural control flow. Agent 2 implements proper Snowflake scripting with conditional logic and error handling. Both maintain data integrity and follow Snowflake best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-89 vs 1-68","Both outputs address the same core requirement of creating Employee backup table in Snowflake. Both include table creation, data population from Employee-Salary join, and conditional logic for empty tables. Agent 1 provides more detailed documentation and alternative approaches, while Agent 2 focuses on executable implementation. Minor divergence in emphasis on documentation vs execution."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-25 vs 15-24, Lines 35-45 vs 26-40","Both follow similar overall structure: table creation, conditional population, cleanup logic. Agent 1 uses multi-step manual approach with separate queries, while Agent 2 uses integrated scripting block. Agent 1 provides example scripting block (lines 56-77) that closely matches Agent 2's implementation structure. Different control flow approaches but same logical decomposition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,90,"Lines 30-32, 48-50","Syntactically valid Snowflake SQL with proper DDL statements, data types, and JOIN syntax. Minor issue: Step 3 DROP statement (lines 48-50) would always execute regardless of row count check, creating logical inconsistency. Comments and example scripting block are syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 26-45","Syntactically valid Snowflake scripting with proper BEGIN/END block, variable declaration, conditional logic, and error handling. All SQL statements are correctly formatted. Minor consideration: EXCEPTION block could be more specific but follows Snowflake scripting standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic validity with minor logical or implementation considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Consider implementing proper conditional logic using Snowflake scripting blocks instead of manual multi-step approach. Remove or conditionally execute the final DROP statement to avoid logical inconsistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Consider adding more comprehensive documentation and comments explaining Snowflake-specific features and migration considerations. The implementation is solid but could benefit from additional context for maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both approaches are valid for Snowflake migration. Agent 2's approach is more production-ready with proper error handling, while Agent 1's documentation approach is valuable for knowledge transfer and maintenance."
