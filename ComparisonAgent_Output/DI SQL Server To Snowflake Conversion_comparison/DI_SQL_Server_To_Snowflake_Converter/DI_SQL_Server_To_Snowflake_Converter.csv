Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs successfully create Snowflake-compatible backup scripts for Employee master data. Output 1 provides comprehensive documentation with multiple approaches but lacks executable procedural logic. Output 2 delivers a cleaner, more executable solution using proper Snowflake scripting. Key differences: Output 1 uses manual multi-step approach with extensive comments, while Output 2 implements proper procedural control flow with BEGIN...END blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 25-35","Both outputs address the same core requirement of creating employee backup tables with conditional logic based on source table population. Both use identical table structure and JOIN logic. Difference: Output 1 suggests manual execution steps while Output 2 provides automated procedural approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-15, 20-30","Both follow similar overall flow: DROP-CREATE-POPULATE pattern. Output 1 uses linear SQL with comments for manual steps, Output 2 uses proper Snowflake scripting blocks. Table creation statements are nearly identical (lines 8-15). Main structural difference is procedural vs manual approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,88,"Lines 25-27, 45-47","Syntactically valid SQL with proper Snowflake data types and structure. Minor issues: Step 3 DROP statement (lines 45-47) would always execute regardless of condition in linear approach. Comments indicate manual intervention required."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,95,"Lines 20-35","Proper Snowflake scripting syntax with correct DECLARE, SELECT INTO, and IF-THEN-ELSE structure. All statements are syntactically correct and executable as a single block. Minor: Missing semicolon after DECLARE statement could cause issues in some contexts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91.5,,"Average of both outputs. Both are syntactically sound with proper Snowflake compatibility. Output 2 has better executable structure while Output 1 has more comprehensive documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Add proper Snowflake scripting blocks for automated execution. Remove contradictory DROP statement at end. Consider consolidating the multiple approach examples into single recommended solution."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Add semicolon after DECLARE statement for better compatibility. Consider adding more detailed comments for maintenance purposes. The procedural approach is preferred for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Output 2 provides the more production-ready solution with proper procedural logic. Output 1 offers valuable documentation but needs structural improvements for automated execution. Recommend using Output 2 as base with enhanced documentation from Output 1."
