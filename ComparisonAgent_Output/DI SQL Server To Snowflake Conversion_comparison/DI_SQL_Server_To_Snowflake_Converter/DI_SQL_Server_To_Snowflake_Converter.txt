# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs successfully convert SQL Server backup logic to Snowflake-compatible syntax. Agent 1 provides a manual multi-step approach with extensive documentation, while Agent 2 implements proper Snowflake Scripting with procedural control flow. Both achieve the same functional goal with different implementation strategies.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core requirement: creating a Snowflake-compatible backup script for Employee data. They share identical table creation logic, data mapping, and business logic for conditional backup creation. The semantic intent is nearly identical, with both handling the case where Employee table might be empty. Minor divergence in implementation approach (manual vs scripted) but same underlying purpose and outcomes.

**Key Similarities:**
- Identical table schema definition (lines 8-14 in both)
- Same data mapping strategy with Employee-Salary JOIN
- Consistent handling of empty table scenarios
- Equivalent business logic for backup creation

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both follow similar overall structure: DROP-CREATE-POPULATE pattern. Agent 1 uses a manual multi-step approach with separate queries and conditional logic in comments, while Agent 2 uses proper Snowflake Scripting with BEGIN...END blocks and IF statements. Table creation schemas are identical. Main structural difference is in control flow implementation - Agent 1 relies on manual execution steps, Agent 2 uses integrated scripting.

**Structural Differences:**
- Agent 1: Manual multi-step execution (lines 25-45)
- Agent 2: Integrated scripting block (lines 20-35)
- Agent 1: Extensive commentary and examples
- Agent 2: Concise procedural implementation

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 90/100):**
Syntactically correct Snowflake SQL with proper table creation, data types, and SELECT statements. The multi-step approach is valid but requires manual execution. Comments accurately describe Snowflake limitations. Minor issue: the final DROP statement (line 40) would always execute regardless of condition in the manual approach, which could be problematic.

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100):**
Syntactically correct Snowflake Scripting with proper BEGIN...END block, variable declaration, and conditional logic. Uses correct Snowflake scripting syntax with DECLARE, SELECT INTO, and IF statements. All SQL statements are properly formed and the procedural logic is sound.

**Overall Correctness: 92.5/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Correctness | 90 | 95 | 92.5 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **90** | **84.2** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
Consider implementing proper Snowflake Scripting blocks for automated execution rather than manual multi-step approach. The extensive documentation is valuable but could be consolidated. Address the potential issue with unconditional DROP statement in the manual flow.

**For Agent 2:**
Excellent use of Snowflake Scripting syntax. Consider adding more detailed comments explaining the procedural logic for better maintainability. The implementation is more robust and production-ready than Agent 1's approach.
