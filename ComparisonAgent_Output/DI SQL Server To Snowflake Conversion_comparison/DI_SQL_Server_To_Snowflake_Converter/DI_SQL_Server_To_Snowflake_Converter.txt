# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs successfully create Snowflake-compatible backup scripts for Employee master data. The first output provides comprehensive documentation with multiple approaches but lacks executable procedural logic. The second output delivers a cleaner, more executable solution using proper Snowflake scripting. Key differences: the first output uses a manual multi-step approach with extensive comments, while the second output implements proper procedural control flow with BEGIN...END blocks.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core requirement of creating employee backup tables with conditional logic based on source table population. Both use identical table structure and JOIN logic. The main difference is that the first output suggests manual execution steps while the second output provides an automated procedural approach. Both scripts achieve the same business objective of creating a backup table with employee and salary data.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both follow a similar overall flow using the DROP-CREATE-POPULATE pattern. The first output uses linear SQL with comments for manual steps, while the second output uses proper Snowflake scripting blocks. Table creation statements are nearly identical (lines 8-15 in both outputs). The main structural difference lies in the procedural vs manual approach - the first output requires manual intervention between steps, while the second output encapsulates everything in a single executable block.

### Correctness

**First Output (Score: 88/100)**
- Syntactically valid SQL with proper Snowflake data types and structure
- Minor issues: The Step 3 DROP statement (lines 45-47) would always execute regardless of condition in the linear approach
- Comments indicate manual intervention required, which reduces automation capability

**Second Output (Score: 95/100)**
- Proper Snowflake scripting syntax with correct DECLARE, SELECT INTO, and IF-THEN-ELSE structure
- All statements are syntactically correct and executable as a single block
- Minor issue: Missing semicolon after DECLARE statement could cause issues in some contexts

**Overall Correctness: 91.5/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | First Output | Second Output | Overall |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Correctness | 88 | 95 | 91.5 |
| **Overall** | **84** | **90** | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For First Output:**
- Add proper Snowflake scripting blocks for automated execution
- Remove contradictory DROP statement at end
- Consider consolidating the multiple approach examples into single recommended solution

**For Second Output:**
- Add semicolon after DECLARE statement for better compatibility
- Consider adding more detailed comments for maintenance purposes
- The procedural approach is preferred for production use

**Overall Recommendation:**
The second output provides the more production-ready solution with proper procedural logic. The first output offers valuable documentation but needs structural improvements for automated execution. Recommend using the second output as base with enhanced documentation from the first output.
