# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents successfully converted SQL Server backup script to Snowflake-compatible format. **Agent 1** provides comprehensive multi-step approach with detailed explanations and example scripting block. **Agent 2** delivers concise procedural solution using Snowflake scripting. High semantic alignment (95/100) with different structural approaches (75/100). Both syntactically correct with overall score of 87/100.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address identical objective: create employee backup table with conditional population. Same logical flow: drop existing backup, create new table structure, check Employee table row count, insert joined data if rows exist, drop backup if empty. Minor implementation differences but equivalent semantic intent and outcomes. Agent 1 uses multi-step manual approach, Agent 2 uses scripting block, but both achieve same result.

**Key Similarities:**
- Identical table schema definition (lines 11-17 in both)
- Same conditional logic for table population vs. deletion
- Equivalent JOIN operation between Employee and Salary tables
- Consistent data type mappings from SQL Server to Snowflake

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Different structural approaches: **Agent 1** (lines 8-45) uses sequential SQL statements with manual execution steps and includes example scripting block (lines 47-65). **Agent 2** (lines 8-35) uses single Snowflake scripting block with procedural logic. Same overall logical sequence but different decomposition strategies. Agent 1 more verbose with explanatory comments, Agent 2 more concise with integrated control flow.

**Structural Differences:**
- Agent 1: Multi-step manual execution with extensive documentation
- Agent 2: Integrated procedural block with automated execution
- Agent 1: Includes both manual and scripting examples
- Agent 2: Single cohesive scripting solution

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 90/100):**
Syntactically correct Snowflake SQL. Proper DDL syntax for table creation (lines 11-17), valid DML for INSERT with JOIN (lines 27-35). Comments indicate manual execution coordination required. Example scripting block (lines 47-65) shows correct Snowflake scripting syntax. Minor deduction for execution complexity requiring manual step coordination.

**Agent 2 (Score: 95/100):**
Syntactically correct Snowflake scripting. Proper BEGIN...END block structure, correct DECLARE statement (line 15), valid variable binding with INTO clause (line 16), proper IF...ELSE...END IF syntax (lines 18-30). Clean procedural implementation with no syntax issues.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 92/100):**
Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness. Agent 1 provides valid SQL with proper Snowflake syntax but requires manual execution coordination. Agent 2 delivers integrated scripting solution with excellent procedural syntax.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Correctness | 90 | 95 | 92 |
| **Overall** | **87** | **88** | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:**
Consider implementing the provided scripting block example (lines 47-65) as the primary solution rather than manual multi-step approach for better automation and reduced execution complexity.

**For Agent 2:**
Add more detailed comments explaining Snowflake-specific syntax and data type mappings for better documentation and maintainability, similar to Agent 1's comprehensive explanations.

**For Both:**
Both solutions are production-ready. Agent 1 better for educational/documentation purposes with extensive explanations. Agent 2 better for automated execution with integrated scripting. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 2's structure with Agent 1's documentation depth.
