Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. Output 1 focuses on conversion validation with unit testing emphasis, while Output 2 provides deeper procedural logic analysis and error handling comparison. Both conclude successful conversion with minor optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical conversion review objectives with similar conclusions about accuracy and completeness. Output 1 emphasizes unit testing validation (lines 15-20) while Output 2 focuses on procedural logic adaptation (lines 25-35). Core findings align: successful conversion, correct data type mapping, proper business logic preservation. Difference in emphasis on testing vs. procedural aspects reduces perfect alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-100,"Nearly identical section organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations. Both follow logical flow from accuracy validation to optimization suggestions. Output 1 includes explicit unit test validation section (lines 15-20), Output 2 includes more detailed error handling analysis (lines 40-50). Section headers and progression are consistent across both outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,98,Lines 1-100,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and logical flow. Minor issue: line 25 mentions 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrts' which appears to be a formatting artifact. All technical references are accurate, section structure is complete, and recommendations are actionable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,100,Lines 1-100,"Fully correct documentation with proper syntax, consistent formatting, and comprehensive technical analysis. All references are accurate, section structure is complete and logical, terminology is consistent throughout, and all recommendations are technically sound and actionable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average correctness score of 99 reflects high quality documentation with minimal formatting issues in Output 1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,N/A,Lines 80-100,"Strengthen procedural logic documentation and error handling analysis to match depth of Output 2. Consider expanding on Snowflake-specific features beyond basic conversion validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,N/A,Lines 90-100,"Incorporate explicit testing validation methodology as shown in Output 1 to enhance conversion verification approach. Consider adding unit test framework references for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs provide valuable conversion analysis. Combining Output 1's testing emphasis with Output 2's procedural depth would create optimal conversion review documentation. Consider standardizing section depth and technical detail level across similar reviews."
