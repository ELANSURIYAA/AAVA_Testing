Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion scripts. They demonstrate high semantic alignment in addressing conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Structural organization is nearly identical with consistent section flow. Both outputs maintain high correctness standards with well-formed documentation and consistent internal references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-50,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy and providing comprehensive analysis. Agent_1 focuses on backup table creation with emphasis on unit testing validation (lines 15-16), while Agent_2 emphasizes procedural logic adaptation and error handling differences (lines 25-30). Both conclude with similar API cost calculations (0.0042 USD). Minor divergence in emphasis on testing vs procedural aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,1-50,"Nearly identical structural organization: Summary → Conversion Accuracy → Discrepancies/Issues → Optimization Suggestions → Overall Assessment → Recommendations → API Cost. Both use consistent header formatting with author attribution and description blocks (lines 1-5). Agent_1 includes more detailed unit testing discussion (lines 15-16), while Agent_2 provides more extensive error handling analysis (lines 25-35). Flow and logical decomposition are essentially equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,1-25,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper section headers, and coherent internal structure. Minor issue: line 8 mentions 'Employee_Info.txt' without full context explanation. All technical references are accurate and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,1-30,"Well-structured analysis with proper formatting and consistent section organization. Minor issues: line 20 has slight redundancy in error handling explanation, and line 35 could benefit from more specific Snowflake feature references. Overall syntax and structure are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper documentation structure, accurate technical content, and consistent formatting. Average score reflects minor presentation issues that do not impact overall quality or usability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,1-25,"Strengthen context explanation for external file references (line 8). Consider expanding on unit testing methodology details to enhance reproducibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,20-35,"Reduce redundancy in error handling explanations (line 20). Provide more specific examples of Snowflake features mentioned in optimization suggestions (line 35)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs provide excellent comprehensive analysis suitable for technical review purposes. Consider standardizing the level of detail in testing and error handling discussions for consistency across similar conversion reviews."
