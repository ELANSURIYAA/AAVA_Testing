Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion scripts. Output 1 focuses on backup table creation with emphasis on troubleshooting and recovery use-cases, while Output 2 provides similar analysis with enhanced procedural logic discussion and Snowflake scripting adaptations. Both maintain high technical accuracy and provide actionable recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. They share similar conclusions about conversion success, data type mappings, and business logic preservation. Key differences: Output 1 emphasizes backup/recovery use-cases (lines 4-6), while Output 2 focuses more on procedural logic adaptation (lines 15-20). Both identify the same technical issues like non-enforced primary keys and error handling differences. The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor emphasis variations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API Cost. Output 1 uses bullet points extensively (lines 8-15), while Output 2 uses more paragraph-based descriptions with bullet sub-points (lines 12-25). The logical flow and section decomposition are highly consistent, with minor formatting differences in presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,95,1-50,"Output 1 demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. Well-formed bullet points, consistent terminology, proper section headers, and coherent internal references. Minor issue: line 23 references 'Pytest unit tests' without prior context establishment. All technical terms are used correctly, and the document structure is logically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,92,1-50,"Output 2 shows strong syntax and internal consistency with proper markdown formatting and coherent structure. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent. Minor issues: line 18 mentions 'TRY...CATCH' adaptation but could be clearer about Snowflake limitations. Line 35 references 'Test suites' without prior establishment. Overall well-formed with minor clarity gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minor reference and context issues that do not significantly impact overall document integrity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,,1-15,"Strengthen context establishment for technical references (e.g., Pytest unit tests). Consider adding more detailed procedural logic discussion to match comprehensive coverage seen in comparative analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,,1-20,"Improve clarity around Snowflake scripting limitations and error handling adaptations. Establish context for test suite references. Consider more structured bullet-point formatting for improved readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-50,"Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis with high accuracy and practical recommendations. Consider standardizing formatting approaches and ensuring all technical references are properly contextualized for enhanced clarity and professional presentation."
