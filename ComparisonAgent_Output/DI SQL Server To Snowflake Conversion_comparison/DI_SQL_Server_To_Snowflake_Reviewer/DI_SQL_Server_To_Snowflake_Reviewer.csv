Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion scripts. Output 1 focuses on backup table creation with emphasis on troubleshooting and recovery use-cases, while Output 2 provides more detailed procedural logic analysis and error handling comparisons. Both maintain similar technical accuracy but differ in structural organization and depth of analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core task of analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. They share common themes: conversion accuracy assessment, data type mapping validation, discrepancy identification, and optimization recommendations. However, Output 1 emphasizes backup/recovery scenarios while Output 2 focuses more on procedural logic adaptation and error handling differences. The semantic alignment is strong but not identical due to different analytical perspectives."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow similar review structures with Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. However, Output 1 uses a more concise bullet-point approach while Output 2 employs more detailed subsections and explanatory text. The logical flow is comparable but the presentation depth and granularity differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_1,95,Lines 1-25,"Output 1 demonstrates excellent technical accuracy with proper SQL terminology, correct data type mappings (CHAR(30) → STRING, INT → INT), and accurate Snowflake feature descriptions. Minor issue: lacks specific line references for some technical claims, but overall content is technically sound and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA_Output_2,92,Lines 1-35,"Output 2 shows strong technical accuracy with detailed procedural logic analysis and comprehensive error handling discussion. Contains accurate Snowflake scripting syntax references and proper constraint behavior descriptions. Minor issues include some repetitive content and less precise organization of technical details compared to Output 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical correctness with accurate SQL and Snowflake knowledge. Average correctness score reflects strong technical foundation with minor presentation and organization differences."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Output_1,N/A,Lines 20-25,"Strengthen analysis by adding more specific line references for technical claims. Consider expanding on Snowflake-specific optimization strategies beyond basic clustering suggestions. The concise format is effective but could benefit from more detailed explanations of complex conversion scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA_Output_2,N/A,Lines 25-35,"Improve content organization to reduce repetition and enhance clarity. Consider consolidating similar technical points for better readability. The detailed approach is valuable but would benefit from more structured presentation and clearer section transitions."
