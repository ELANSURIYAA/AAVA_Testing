Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. Agent_1 focuses on conversion accuracy with detailed unit testing validation, while Agent_2 emphasizes procedural logic adaptation and error handling differences. Both maintain high technical quality with similar conclusions about conversion success, though Agent_2 provides more detailed analysis of Snowflake-specific adaptations and limitations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. They share identical understanding of the conversion requirements, data type mappings, and business logic preservation. Minor differences exist in emphasis - Agent_1 focuses more on unit testing validation while Agent_2 emphasizes procedural logic adaptation and error handling nuances. Both conclude successful conversion with similar optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow similar analytical structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations. Agent_1 includes explicit unit test validation sections while Agent_2 provides more detailed procedural logic analysis. Both use consistent section ordering and logical flow, with Agent_2 providing slightly more granular subsection organization in the Discrepancies section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-45,"Agent_1 output demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper technical terminology, consistent formatting, and accurate technical details. All references to SQL Server and Snowflake features are technically accurate. Minor formatting inconsistency in the metadata header section (line 1-5) where description spans multiple lines without clear delimiter."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,Lines 1-50,"Agent_2 output shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper code block formatting, consistent technical terminology, and accurate feature descriptions. All SQL Server and Snowflake technical references are precise and well-formatted. Metadata header is properly structured with clear delimiters."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs maintain high technical accuracy and syntactic correctness. Agent_2 slightly edges out with better formatting consistency, particularly in code block presentation and metadata structure. Both demonstrate comprehensive understanding of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion requirements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 35-45,"Strengthen formatting consistency in metadata headers and consider adding more explicit section delimiters for improved readability. The unit testing validation approach is excellent and should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 40-50,"Excellent technical depth and formatting. Consider adding explicit unit testing validation sections similar to Agent_1 to enhance the completeness of the analysis framework."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs provide valuable SQL Server to Snowflake conversion analysis. Consider combining Agent_1's unit testing validation approach with Agent_2's detailed procedural logic analysis for optimal conversion review methodology. Both agents should maintain their high technical accuracy while improving cross-referencing between conversion accuracy and testing validation sections."
