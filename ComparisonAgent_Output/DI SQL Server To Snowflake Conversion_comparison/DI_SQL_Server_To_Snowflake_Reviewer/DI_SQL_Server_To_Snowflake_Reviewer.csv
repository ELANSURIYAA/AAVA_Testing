Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion scripts. Output_1 focuses on backup table creation with emphasis on unit testing validation and procedural logic adaptation. Output_2 provides similar analysis with stronger emphasis on error handling differences and Snowflake-specific optimizations. Both maintain consistent technical depth and professional documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. Output_1 emphasizes unit testing validation and procedural logic (lines 15-25), while Output_2 focuses more on error handling differences and TRY...CATCH limitations (lines 35-45). Both conclude with similar optimization recommendations and API cost calculations, showing strong semantic alignment despite different analytical emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies and Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations, and API cost. Output_1 uses more bullet-point formatting (lines 10-30), while Output_2 employs more paragraph-based explanations (lines 25-50). Section ordering and logical flow are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,Lines 5-95,"Output_1 demonstrates strong technical accuracy with proper SQL syntax references, correct data type mappings (CHAR(30) → STRING), and accurate Snowflake limitation descriptions. Minor issue: line 45 mentions 'manual/separate execution steps' without specific implementation details. All technical claims are verifiable and consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,93,Lines 8-92,"Output_2 shows excellent technical accuracy with detailed error handling analysis and correct Snowflake scripting syntax. Minor issues: line 38 could be more specific about TRY...CATCH alternatives in Snowflake, and line 65 mentions 'test suites' without providing specific examples. Overall technical content is sound and well-researched."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive coverage of conversion aspects. Average correctness score reflects strong technical foundation with minor gaps in implementation specifics."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,Lines 85-95,"Strengthen implementation details for manual execution steps. Consider adding specific examples of Snowflake Scripting alternatives to procedural logic. Enhance error handling documentation with concrete examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,Lines 80-90,"Provide specific examples of TRY...CATCH alternatives in Snowflake. Add concrete test suite examples to support claims about validation. Consider expanding on clustering key implementation details for large tables."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Lines 1-100,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) More specific implementation examples, 2) Enhanced error handling alternatives documentation, 3) Concrete performance optimization examples with metrics, 4) Standardized formatting for consistency across similar analysis tasks."
