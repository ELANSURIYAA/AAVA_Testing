Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion with high semantic alignment (92/100), very similar structural organization (88/100), and excellent syntactic correctness (95/100 average). Minor differences exist in error handling emphasis and optimization details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 10-25, 35-45","Both outputs address identical core objectives: SQL Server to Snowflake conversion review. Agent_1_Review focuses more on unit testing validation while Agent_2_Review emphasizes procedural logic adaptation. Both cover conversion accuracy, data consistency, and optimization with aligned conclusions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-15, 20-30, 40-50","Both follow nearly identical section structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies/Issues, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. Agent_2_Review has slightly more detailed subsections in error handling and performance features."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Review,96,"Lines 1-50","Excellent formatting and internal consistency. Minor issue: some bullet points could be more consistently formatted. All references are valid and content is well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Review,94,"Lines 1-50","Very good formatting with clear section headers. Minor inconsistency in bullet point formatting in lines 25-30. All technical content is accurate and well-presented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (96 + 94) / 2 = 95"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Review,,"Lines 45-50","Focus on schema qualification, automation via Snowflake Scripting, and leveraging Time Travel features. Recommendations are practical and Snowflake-specific."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Review,,"Lines 45-50","Emphasizes clustering keys, error logging, and performance optimization. Includes retention policies and metadata consistency. More comprehensive operational recommendations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 45-50","Both provide valuable, complementary recommendations. Agent_1_Review focuses on technical implementation while Agent_2_Review covers operational aspects. Combined recommendations would be highly effective."
