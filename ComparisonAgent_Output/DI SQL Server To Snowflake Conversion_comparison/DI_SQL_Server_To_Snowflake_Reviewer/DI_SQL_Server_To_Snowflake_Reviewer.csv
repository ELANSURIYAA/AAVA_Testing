Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-95,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of SQL Server to Snowflake conversion with high semantic alignment (88/100) and strong structural similarity (82/100). Agent1 focuses on conversion accuracy and optimization suggestions with clear sectional organization, while Agent2 emphasizes procedural logic adaptation and error handling differences. Both demonstrate excellent syntax correctness (95/100 average). Key differences include Agent2's more detailed error handling analysis and Agent1's stronger focus on unit testing validation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 8-25, 35-50","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing SQL Server to Snowflake conversion accuracy. They share similar conclusions about data type mapping, join logic preservation, and business logic equivalence. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent1 focuses more on unit testing validation (lines 15-18) while Agent2 emphasizes procedural logic adaptation (lines 35-40). Both identify the same core conversion elements but with different analytical depth in specific areas."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-7, 26-34, 51-70","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, and Recommendations sections. Agent1 uses more concise bullet-point organization while Agent2 employs more detailed subsection breakdowns. Flow and logical progression are nearly identical, with Agent2 providing more granular categorization of issues (lines 51-60) compared to Agent1's streamlined approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Reviewer_Agent1,95,"Lines 1-95","Excellent syntax correctness with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issues: missing schema qualification discussion depth (line 30) and limited automation details. All technical statements are accurate and well-supported."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_SQL_Server_To_Snowflake_Reviewer_Agent2,95,"Lines 1-95","Excellent syntax correctness with comprehensive technical accuracy. Proper formatting and consistent structure throughout. Minor issue: some redundancy in error handling discussion (lines 45-50) but all statements are technically sound and well-referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical content, proper formatting, and consistent terminology. Average score reflects minor organizational and depth variations but no significant syntax or accuracy issues."
