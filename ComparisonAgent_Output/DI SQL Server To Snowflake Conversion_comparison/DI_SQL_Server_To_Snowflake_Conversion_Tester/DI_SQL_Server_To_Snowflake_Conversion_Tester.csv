Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents delivered comprehensive test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation with strong semantic alignment (85/100) and good structural similarity (78/100). Agent 1 provides a cleaner, more maintainable approach with 8 focused test cases, while Agent 2 offers broader coverage with 12 test cases including performance and manual validation aspects. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness (Agent 1: 95/100, Agent 2: 88/100) with minor issues in error handling and Snowflake syntax compatibility."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the core goal of validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. They share common test scenarios: happy path validation (TC01), empty table handling (TC02), inner join logic verification (TC03), NULL value handling (TC04/TC06), and multiple record processing (TC07). However, Agent 2 extends beyond basic functionality to include performance testing (TC09), indexing recommendations (TC10-TC12), and more sophisticated error handling scenarios. The semantic divergence occurs in scope breadth rather than core understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by Pytest implementation. Agent 1 uses a more straightforward approach with function-scoped fixtures and direct SQL execution, while Agent 2 employs module-scoped fixtures and stored procedure syntax. Key structural differences: Agent 1 implements run_backup_script() with conditional logic (lines 65-80), while Agent 2 uses SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant with BEGIN/END blocks (lines 67-82). Both use similar helper functions for table setup, but Agent 2 includes additional error handling and performance measurement utilities."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,75-76,"Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper Snowflake connector usage, valid SQL syntax, and well-structured test implementations. Minor issue: Line 75-76 shows potential inconsistency in table existence checking logic that could lead to false positives in edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,67-82,"Agent 2 shows good overall correctness but contains Snowflake syntax issues. Lines 67-82 use stored procedure syntax (BEGIN/DECLARE/END) that may not be compatible with all Snowflake environments. Line 71 uses variable binding syntax (:employee_count) that requires specific Snowflake configuration. Error handling is more robust but syntax compatibility is questionable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with comprehensive test coverage and proper testing frameworks. Average correctness score reflects Agent 1's cleaner implementation offset by Agent 2's syntax complexity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,N/A,"Recommended for production use due to cleaner syntax and better maintainability. Consider adding performance test cases and indexing recommendations from Agent 2 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,67-82,"Requires syntax review for Snowflake compatibility before production deployment. The stored procedure approach (lines 67-82) should be validated in target Snowflake environment. Consider simplifying to Agent 1's direct SQL approach for better portability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized error message validation, 2) Transaction rollback testing, 3) Concurrent execution scenarios, 4) Data type boundary testing, 5) Integration with CI/CD pipeline considerations."
