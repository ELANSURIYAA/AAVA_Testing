Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Pytest test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Agent 1 delivers 8 focused test cases with clean SQL implementation, while Agent 2 provides 12 test cases including performance and manual review scenarios using stored procedure syntax. Key differences: Agent 2 uses Snowflake-specific stored procedure blocks while Agent 1 uses standard SQL; Agent 2 includes additional performance and manual intervention test cases; both have proper error handling but different approaches to script execution."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core goal of testing Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. They share similar test scenarios for happy path (TC01), empty tables (TC02), inner join logic (TC03-TC05), and NULL handling (TC04/TC06). However, Agent 2 extends beyond basic functionality to include performance testing (TC09), manual intervention recommendations (TC10-TC12), and more comprehensive error scenarios (TC03, TC07). The semantic intent is highly aligned but Agent 2 provides broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case list followed by Pytest implementation. However, structural differences emerge in implementation approach. Agent 1 uses a procedural run_backup_script() function (lines 45-65) executing individual SQL statements, while Agent 2 defines a complete stored procedure in SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT variable (lines 58-75) with BEGIN/END blocks. Agent 1 has 8 test functions vs Agent 2's 12 functions. Both use similar fixture patterns and helper functions but Agent 2 includes additional performance timing and manual validation tests."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 45-65, 85-90","Agent 1 code is syntactically correct with proper Python/Pytest structure. Minor issues: run_backup_script() creates table unconditionally then drops if empty (lines 45-65), which could be optimized. Helper functions are well-structured. All SQL statements are valid. Connection handling and cleanup are properly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 58-75, 95-100, 140-145","Agent 2 has syntax issues in the stored procedure block. Lines 58-75 use Snowflake stored procedure syntax with DECLARE and IF statements, but the variable declaration syntax ':employee_count' (line 62) may not be standard Snowflake. Error handling in run_script() function (lines 95-100) is good. Some test assertions could be more robust (lines 140-145). Overall structure is sound but stored procedure syntax needs verification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score of 91.5, rounded to 92. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with proper Pytest structure, fixtures, and test logic. Agent 1 has cleaner, more straightforward SQL implementation while Agent 2 attempts more advanced Snowflake features but with some syntax uncertainties."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 45-65","Consider optimizing run_backup_script() to avoid creating employee_bkup table when Employee table is empty. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases. Consider adding performance benchmarks similar to Agent 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 58-75, 62","Verify and correct Snowflake stored procedure syntax, particularly variable declaration format on line 62. Ensure the BEGIN/END block syntax is compatible with target Snowflake version. Consider simplifying the stored procedure approach if standard SQL suffices for the use case."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardizing on either basic SQL or stored procedure approach based on requirements, 2) Adding data validation tests for data types and constraints, 3) Including transaction rollback testing, 4) Adding concurrent access testing scenarios, 5) Documenting Snowflake version compatibility requirements."
