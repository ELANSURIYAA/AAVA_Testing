Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive Pytest test suites for Snowflake Employee backup validation. Ascendion_AVA+_Agent1 delivered 8 focused test cases with clean, straightforward implementation. Ascendion_AVA+_Agent2 provided 12 test cases with enhanced error handling, performance testing, and manual verification steps. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of testing requirements with different approaches to comprehensiveness vs. simplicity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. They share similar test scenarios (happy path, empty tables, inner join logic, NULL handling) but differ in scope. Agent1 focuses on 8 essential test cases while Agent2 extends to 12 cases including performance testing (TC09), manual verification steps (TC10-TC12), and more comprehensive error handling (TC03, TC07). The semantic intent is highly aligned with Agent2 providing broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both follow standard Pytest structure with fixtures, setup functions, and test methods. Agent1 uses function-scoped fixtures (lines 15-30) while Agent2 uses module-scoped connection with autouse cleanup (lines 11-25). Agent1 implements simpler helper functions (setup_employee_table, setup_salary_table, run_backup_script) while Agent2 uses more sophisticated error handling with try-catch blocks and includes a complex SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant (lines 54-72). The overall flow is similar but implementation approaches differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Agent1,95,N/A,"Syntactically correct Python code with proper Pytest structure. Minor issues: Line 15 fixture scope could be 'session' for better performance, and line 89 CREATE TABLE statement could benefit from IF NOT EXISTS clause for robustness. All imports are correct, function signatures are valid, and SQL syntax is appropriate for Snowflake."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AVA+_Agent2,88,Lines 54-72,"Generally correct Python/Pytest code but contains Snowflake stored procedure syntax (BEGIN/DECLARE/IF blocks) in SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT that may not execute as intended in standard Snowflake SQL. Lines 54-72 use procedural syntax that requires Snowflake's stored procedure context. The Python test logic is sound, but the embedded SQL script needs verification for Snowflake compatibility."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score of 91.5, rounded to 92. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with minor syntax and compatibility considerations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Consider adding performance testing and error handling scenarios similar to Agent2's TC09 and TC07. Implement session-scoped fixtures for better test performance. Add manual verification steps for production deployment considerations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AVA+_Agent2,N/A,Lines 54-72,"Verify Snowflake stored procedure syntax compatibility in SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT. Consider simplifying the procedural logic to standard SQL statements that work in Snowflake's SQL context. Validate that BEGIN/DECLARE blocks execute correctly in the target Snowflake environment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from integration: combine Agent1's clean implementation approach with Agent2's comprehensive test coverage. Consider standardizing on connection management patterns and adding configuration management for different Snowflake environments."
