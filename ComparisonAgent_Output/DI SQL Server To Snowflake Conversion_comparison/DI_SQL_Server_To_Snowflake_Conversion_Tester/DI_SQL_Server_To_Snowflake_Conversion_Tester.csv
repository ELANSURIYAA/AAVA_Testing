Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Both agents provide comprehensive test suites for Snowflake Employee backup table validation. Agent_1 delivers 8 focused test cases with clean implementation, while Agent_2 provides 12 test cases including advanced scenarios like performance testing and error handling. Agent_2 demonstrates more enterprise-ready practices with sophisticated error handling and Snowflake-specific optimizations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"","Both outputs address identical core functionality (Employee backup table creation and validation) with similar test scenarios. Agent_1 covers fundamental cases (TC01-TC08) while Agent_2 extends with performance (TC09), indexing recommendations (TC10-TC12), and enhanced error handling. The semantic intent is highly aligned with Agent_2 providing broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"","Both follow identical high-level structure: Test Case List → Pytest Script → API Cost. However, implementation approaches differ significantly. Agent_1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 23) and direct SQL execution, while Agent_2 employs module-level fixtures (line 12), autouse cleanup (line 20), and stored procedure syntax (lines 65-78). Agent_2 includes more sophisticated error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 23, 45, 67, 89","Excellent syntax and structure. Minor issues: fixture scope could be optimized (line 23 uses function scope), and some SQL statements could benefit from explicit transaction handling. All pytest functions are properly structured and SQL syntax is valid for Snowflake."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 65-78, 95, 145","Strong implementation with advanced features. Issues include: stored procedure syntax in SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT (lines 65-78) may not execute as expected in some Snowflake configurations, and complex error handling in run_script function (line 95) could mask specific error types. Performance test timeout assumption (line 145) may be environment-dependent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93.5,"","Average of individual agent scores: (95 + 92) / 2 = 93.5. Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with valid syntax, proper pytest structure, and appropriate Snowflake SQL usage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,"","","Consider adopting module-level fixtures for better test performance, add explicit error handling for database connection failures, and include performance testing for larger datasets as demonstrated in Agent_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,"","","Simplify stored procedure syntax for better compatibility across Snowflake environments, consider breaking down complex error handling into specific exception types, and validate performance test timeout assumptions across different deployment environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,"","","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized connection parameter management, 2) Consistent error message validation patterns, 3) Addition of data validation assertions beyond row count checks, 4) Integration with CI/CD pipeline considerations for automated testing."
