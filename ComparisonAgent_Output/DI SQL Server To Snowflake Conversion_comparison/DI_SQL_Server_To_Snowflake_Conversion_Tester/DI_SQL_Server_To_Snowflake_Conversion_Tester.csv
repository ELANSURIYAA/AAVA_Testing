Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test suites for Snowflake Employee backup table validation. Output 1 focuses on 8 core functional test cases with straightforward implementation, while Output 2 expands to 12 test cases including performance testing, manual intervention requirements, and more sophisticated error handling. Both achieve the primary objective but differ in scope and complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-20, 45-60","Both outputs address identical core functionality: testing Employee backup table creation in Snowflake with proper join logic, NULL handling, and edge cases. Output 1 covers 8 essential scenarios (TC01-TC08) while Output 2 extends to 12 scenarios (TC01-TC12) adding performance testing, manual review requirements, and enhanced error handling. The fundamental semantic intent is nearly identical with Output 2 providing broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 21-44, 61-150","Both outputs follow similar three-section structure: Test Case List, Pytest Script, API Cost Calculation. However, Output 1 uses simpler helper functions and direct test execution, while Output 2 implements more sophisticated patterns including module-level fixtures, stored procedure-like script execution with BEGIN/END blocks, and comprehensive cleanup mechanisms. Output 2's structure is more enterprise-ready but less straightforward."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output1,92,"Lines 45-150","Output 1 demonstrates solid Python/Pytest syntax with proper fixture usage, connection handling, and SQL execution. Minor issues include: hardcoded credentials in comments (line 47), potential resource leaks without proper connection pooling, and basic error handling. The SQL logic is syntactically correct and follows Snowflake conventions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output2,89,"Lines 61-200","Output 2 shows advanced Pytest patterns with module-level fixtures and comprehensive cleanup. However, contains syntax issues: the SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT uses stored procedure syntax (BEGIN/DECLARE/IF) which may not be compatible with standard Snowflake SQL execution (lines 85-95). The script assumes Snowflake stored procedure capabilities that require specific execution context. Otherwise, Python syntax is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90.5, rounded to 91. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with minor syntax and implementation concerns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output1,N/A,"Lines 47-50","Replace hardcoded credential placeholders with environment variables or configuration management. Implement connection pooling for better resource management. Add more comprehensive error handling for database connection failures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output2,N/A,"Lines 85-95","Revise the SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT to use standard SQL syntax instead of stored procedure syntax, or ensure proper stored procedure execution context. The BEGIN/DECLARE/IF syntax requires Snowflake stored procedure execution which may not work with standard cursor.execute() calls. Consider splitting into conditional logic within Python rather than SQL stored procedure syntax."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Parameterized test data for better maintainability, 2) Integration with CI/CD pipeline considerations, 3) More detailed assertion messages for test failures, 4) Documentation of Snowflake-specific requirements and limitations, 5) Consider using Snowflake's Python connector best practices for connection management."
