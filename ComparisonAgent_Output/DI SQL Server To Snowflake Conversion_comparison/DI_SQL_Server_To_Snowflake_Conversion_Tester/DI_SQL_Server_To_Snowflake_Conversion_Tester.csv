Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup table creation. Agent 1 delivers 8 focused test cases covering core functionality, while Agent 2 extends to 12 test cases including performance testing, error handling, and manual review items. Both demonstrate strong technical competency with proper pytest patterns and Snowflake integration. Agent 2 shows more enterprise-grade considerations but introduces potential compatibility risks with procedural SQL blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core testing requirements for Employee backup validation. Agent 1 covers fundamental scenarios (lines 1-8 test cases), while Agent 2 extends with performance and manual review scenarios (lines 9-12). The underlying intent, data validation logic, and expected outcomes are highly aligned. Minor divergence in scope and depth of coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both follow similar three-part structure: Test Case List → Pytest Script → API Cost. Agent 1 uses simpler fixture approach (lines 15-25), while Agent 2 implements more sophisticated module-scoped fixtures and cleanup patterns (lines 15-35). Both use similar helper functions and test method patterns. Agent 2 introduces procedural SQL blocks (lines 85-95) creating structural differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,Lines 45-180,"Syntactically correct pytest implementation with proper Snowflake connector usage. Valid SQL syntax throughout. Proper test assertions and data setup. Minor issue: fixture cleanup could be more robust for edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,Lines 90-95,"Generally correct pytest implementation with advanced features. However, uses Snowflake procedural SQL blocks (BEGIN/DECLARE/IF statements) which may not be supported in all Snowflake editions or require specific privileges. This could cause runtime failures in some environments."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong technical implementation with Agent 2's potential compatibility concerns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,N/A,"Excellent foundation with clean, portable pytest implementation. Consider adding performance testing and error handling scenarios from Agent 2. Enhance fixture cleanup robustness for production use."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,N/A,"Comprehensive test coverage with enterprise considerations. Replace procedural SQL blocks (lines 90-95) with standard SQL to ensure broader Snowflake compatibility. Consider simplifying manual review tests into automated assertions where possible."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate strong testing practices. Recommend combining Agent 1's simplicity and portability with Agent 2's comprehensive coverage. Ensure all SQL features used are compatible across Snowflake editions and deployment scenarios."
