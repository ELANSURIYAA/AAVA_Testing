Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs are comprehensive Pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. Agent 1 provides a solid foundation with 8 core test cases covering basic functionality, while Agent 2 offers a more enterprise-grade solution with 9 test cases, advanced error handling, logging, performance testing, and Snowflake procedural blocks. The outputs share 85% semantic alignment in testing objectives but differ significantly in implementation sophistication and enterprise readiness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs target the same core objective: validating Employee backup creation logic in Snowflake. They test identical scenarios like empty tables, inner joins, NULL handling, and data integrity. However, Agent 2 extends the semantic scope with performance testing (lines 180-195), comprehensive error handling (lines 70-85), and enterprise logging (lines 15-20). The fundamental testing logic remains aligned, but Agent 2 demonstrates broader understanding of production requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Lines 10-50 (Agent 1), Lines 25-65 (Agent 2)","Both follow standard Pytest structure with fixtures and test functions. Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 10) while Agent 2 uses module-scoped connection (line 25) and autouse cleanup (line 40). Agent 2 introduces logging configuration (lines 15-20) and more sophisticated helper functions. The most significant structural difference is Agent 2's use of Snowflake procedural blocks (lines 90-110) versus Agent 1's imperative approach (lines 60-80). Test organization is similar but Agent 2 shows more enterprise-grade structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 25-35, 85-95","Agent 1 code is syntactically correct Python/Pytest with proper Snowflake connector usage. Minor issues include potential connection resource management in fixture cleanup and basic error handling. All SQL statements are valid Snowflake syntax. Test assertions are properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,"Lines 90-110, 145-150","Agent 2 has syntactic issues with Snowflake procedural block syntax (lines 90-110). The BEGIN/DECLARE/IF/END block may not execute properly in Snowflake as written. The DECLARE statement syntax and variable binding (:employee_count) need verification. Python code structure is correct with proper logging and error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Agent 1 has higher syntactic correctness while Agent 2 has more comprehensive functionality despite some procedural SQL syntax concerns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Enhance with logging framework, add performance testing for large datasets, implement comprehensive error handling, and consider module-scoped fixtures for better resource management. Add edge cases for concurrent access and transaction handling."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Fix Snowflake procedural block syntax - verify DECLARE statement format and variable binding syntax. Test the procedural block execution in actual Snowflake environment. Consider simplifying the script execution if procedural blocks cause issues. Validate that all Snowflake-specific syntax is compatible with the target environment."
