Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produced comprehensive Pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. Agent 1 provides a solid foundation with 8 core test cases covering basic functionality, while Agent 2 extends this with advanced features including error handling, performance testing, and logging. The outputs share the same fundamental testing approach but differ significantly in scope and sophistication."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs address the core objective of testing Employee backup table creation and data validation in Snowflake. They share identical test scenarios for happy path (lines 1-20 vs 1-25), empty employee tables (lines 30-35 vs 45-50), and inner join validation (lines 40-50 vs 60-70). However, Agent 2 expands the semantic scope with error handling tests (lines 80-90), performance validation (lines 140-160), and comprehensive logging (lines 10-15). The core intent is preserved but Agent 2 demonstrates broader understanding of enterprise testing requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,N/A,"Both outputs follow standard Pytest structure with fixtures, helper functions, and test cases. Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 8) while Agent 2 uses module-scoped connection (line 18) and autouse cleanup (line 28). Agent 1 implements individual helper functions (lines 15-45) whereas Agent 2 centralizes the backup logic in a single SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant (lines 70-85). Both maintain similar test function naming conventions (test_TC01, test_TC02, etc.) but Agent 2 adds structured logging and more sophisticated error handling patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,N/A,"Agent 1 code is syntactically correct with proper Python/Pytest structure. All imports are valid, fixture definitions follow Pytest conventions, and SQL statements use correct Snowflake syntax. Minor issue: the cleanup in fixture (lines 12-18) could potentially fail silently on non-existent tables, but this is handled with try/except implicitly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,92,N/A,"Agent 2 code is syntactically correct with proper imports and structure. However, there are potential issues: the SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT uses Snowflake stored procedure syntax (BEGIN/END block, lines 75-85) which may not be supported in all Snowflake editions. The script execution logic (lines 35-45) splits on semicolons which could break with complex SQL. Error handling is comprehensive but some assertions use string matching that could be fragile."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python/Pytest structure and valid Snowflake SQL syntax. Average correctness score reflects minor potential issues in Agent 2's stored procedure approach and script parsing logic."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Consider adding error handling for edge cases, implementing logging for better debugging, and expanding test coverage to include performance scenarios and comprehensive error conditions as demonstrated in Agent 2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Verify Snowflake stored procedure syntax compatibility across different Snowflake editions. Consider simplifying the script execution logic to handle complex SQL statements more robustly. The comprehensive approach is excellent but ensure all syntax features are universally supported."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both implementations would benefit from: 1) Parameterized test data for better maintainability, 2) Integration with CI/CD pipelines, 3) Test data factories for complex scenarios, 4) Performance benchmarking with configurable thresholds, 5) Database connection pooling for better resource management."
