Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic. The first output uses a more straightforward procedural approach with function-scoped fixtures, while the second output employs a more sophisticated approach with module-scoped fixtures, stored procedure-like scripts, and additional performance testing. Both achieve the core testing objectives with high correctness scores."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address identical testing objectives for Snowflake Employee backup validation. They cover similar test scenarios including happy path, empty tables, join logic, and edge cases. The second output extends coverage with performance testing (TC09) and more comprehensive error handling. Minor differences in approach (procedural vs script-based) and fixture scope reduce perfect alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs follow pytest framework conventions but differ in structural organization. First output uses function-scoped fixtures (line 8) and direct SQL execution approach, while second output uses module-scoped fixtures (line 19) with autouse cleanup (line 28). Second output introduces a centralized SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant (line 77) and more sophisticated helper functions. Test case organization is similar but execution patterns differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,,"Output demonstrates excellent Python and pytest syntax correctness. All imports are valid, fixture definitions are proper, and SQL statements are syntactically correct. Minor deduction for potential connection resource management in cleanup (lines 18-22) where exceptions during cleanup could mask original test failures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,95,,"Output shows excellent Python and pytest syntax correctness with proper imports, fixture definitions, and SQL syntax. Includes sophisticated error handling with try-catch blocks (lines 31-35, 41-46). Minor deduction for potential issues with multi-statement script execution approach that could complicate debugging individual statement failures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python, pytest, and SQL syntax. Both properly handle Snowflake connector usage and implement appropriate test structures. Minor deductions for different but valid approaches to resource management and error handling."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,,,"Consider adopting module-scoped fixtures for better test performance and resource utilization. Add performance testing capabilities similar to TC09 in the second output. Enhance error handling in cleanup procedures to prevent masking of original test failures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,,"Consider simplifying the script execution approach for better individual statement debugging. The centralized script approach, while sophisticated, may complicate troubleshooting specific SQL statement failures. Consider adding more granular test cases for individual SQL operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized logging approaches, 2) Consistent fixture scoping strategy across the test suite, 3) Enhanced documentation of test data setup and expected outcomes, 4) Integration of both approaches - combining the simplicity of direct SQL execution with the sophistication of centralized script management."
