Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Agent 1 and Agent 2 both provide comprehensive pytest suites for Snowflake employee backup functionality. Agent 2 demonstrates superior architecture with module-scoped fixtures, stored procedure implementation, enhanced error handling, and performance testing. Agent 1 provides a simpler, more direct approach with function-scoped fixtures and basic test coverage. Both outputs are syntactically correct and functionally equivalent in core testing objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-200 (both files)","Both agents address the same core objective of testing Snowflake employee backup functionality. They share similar test scenarios including happy path, empty tables, join validation, and null handling. Agent 2 extends the semantic scope with performance testing (lines 180-195) and more sophisticated error handling (lines 70-85), while Agent 1 focuses on core functionality validation. The semantic intent is highly aligned with Agent 2 providing broader coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 10-50 (fixtures), Lines 60-120 (helpers), Lines 130-200 (tests)","Both agents follow pytest structure with fixtures, helper functions, and test cases. Key structural differences: Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures (lines 10-25) while Agent 2 uses module-scoped with autouse cleanup (lines 20-40). Agent 2 implements stored procedure approach with BEGIN/END blocks (lines 90-110) versus Agent 1's direct SQL execution (lines 80-95). Test organization is similar but Agent 2 includes additional performance and error handling tests."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-20 (connection setup), Lines 45-60 (table creation)","Agent 1 code is syntactically correct with proper pytest fixtures, valid Snowflake SQL syntax, and correct Python indentation. Minor issue: connection parameters use placeholder values that need replacement (lines 15-20). All SQL statements are properly formatted and table schemas are correctly defined."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 25-35 (connection setup), Lines 95-105 (stored procedure)","Agent 2 code demonstrates excellent syntax with proper pytest decorators, valid Snowflake stored procedure syntax using BEGIN/END blocks, and comprehensive error handling. Very minor issue: connection parameters use placeholder values (lines 25-35). The stored procedure implementation is syntactically correct for Snowflake."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both agents demonstrate high syntactic correctness. Agent 2 scores slightly higher due to more sophisticated error handling and stored procedure implementation. Average correctness score reflects excellent code quality across both implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Replace placeholder connection parameters (lines 15-20) with environment variables or configuration management. Consider adding performance testing similar to Agent 2's approach (lines 180-195). Enhance error handling for missing tables and connection failures."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Replace placeholder connection parameters (lines 25-35) with secure credential management. The stored procedure approach is excellent but ensure Snowflake version compatibility. Consider adding more granular test assertions for edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both implementations provide solid test coverage. Agent 2's approach with module-scoped fixtures and stored procedures is more production-ready. Consider combining Agent 1's simplicity with Agent 2's advanced features for optimal solution. Implement proper credential management and CI/CD integration for both approaches."
