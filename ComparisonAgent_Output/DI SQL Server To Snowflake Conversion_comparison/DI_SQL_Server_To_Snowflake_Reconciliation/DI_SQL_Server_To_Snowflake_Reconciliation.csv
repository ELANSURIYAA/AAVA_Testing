Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents deliver pytest-based testing frameworks for Snowflake Employee backup validation with similar core functionality but different architectural approaches. Agent_1 provides a streamlined implementation focused on essential test scenarios, while Agent_2 offers a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution with advanced error handling, performance testing, and migration-specific features. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with syntactically correct Python code."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of testing Employee backup creation logic in Snowflake using pytest. They share identical test scenarios including happy path validation, empty table handling, inner join verification, and NULL value processing. The primary semantic divergence lies in Agent_2's migration-specific context (Teradata to Snowflake) versus Agent_1's general backup testing approach. Agent_2 includes additional semantic layers like performance testing (lines 165-175) and comprehensive error handling that extend beyond Agent_1's scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs follow pytest conventions with fixture-based setup, helper functions, and systematic test case organization. Agent_1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 8) while Agent_2 employs module-scoped connections (line 19) with autouse cleanup fixtures (line 30). Agent_2 demonstrates more sophisticated structural patterns including centralized script execution (lines 69-81), multi-statement handling, and enterprise logging integration (line 14). The test case naming and organization patterns are highly similar, but Agent_2's additional architectural layers create structural divergence."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,N/A,"Agent_1 demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with valid Python syntax, proper pytest decorators, correct Snowflake connector usage, and well-formed SQL statements. Minor issues include potential connection resource leaks in edge cases and basic error handling patterns. All variable references are properly defined and function signatures are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,N/A,"Agent_2 exhibits superior syntactic correctness with comprehensive error handling, proper resource management using context managers (lines 45-51), and robust exception handling patterns. The code includes proper logging configuration, multi-statement SQL execution with error recovery, and enterprise-grade connection management. All syntax is valid and follows Python best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with valid Python code, proper imports, and correct pytest usage. Agent_2 slightly outperforms with more robust error handling and resource management patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Consider implementing context managers for database connections to ensure proper resource cleanup. Add comprehensive error handling for database connection failures and SQL execution errors. Consider adding performance benchmarking capabilities for larger datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 69-81, 140-150","Excellent implementation with comprehensive error handling and enterprise features. Consider adding more granular test isolation and potentially splitting the large SNOWFLAKE_SCRIPT constant into smaller, more manageable components for better maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Lines 1-10 (both)","Both implementations would benefit from enhanced documentation of test data setup patterns and consideration of parameterized tests for broader scenario coverage. Consider standardizing the fixture scoping approach across similar test suites."
