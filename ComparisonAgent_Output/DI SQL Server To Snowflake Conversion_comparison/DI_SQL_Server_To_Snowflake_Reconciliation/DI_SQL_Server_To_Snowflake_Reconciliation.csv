Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are Python Pytest suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup logic migration. Agent 1 provides a basic unit testing framework with 8 test cases covering core functionality like table creation, data insertion, and edge cases. Agent 2 offers a more comprehensive automated testing suite with 9 test cases, including advanced features like error handling, performance testing, logging, and multi-statement script execution. While both address the same core testing requirements, Agent 2 demonstrates superior enterprise-grade testing practices with better error handling, cleanup mechanisms, and performance validation. The semantic alignment is strong (85/100) as both target the same business logic, but structural differences (75/100) reflect different approaches to test organization and execution. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs target the same core objective: validating Snowflake Employee backup creation logic through comprehensive test cases. Agent 1 focuses on fundamental scenarios like happy path (line 67), empty tables (line 73), inner join validation (line 79), and NULL handling (line 91). Agent 2 covers similar scenarios but expands scope with error handling for missing tables (line 108, 147), performance testing for large datasets (line 158), and syntax compliance validation (line 138). Both validate the same business rules: table creation when employees exist, proper joins between Employee and Salary tables, and cleanup when tables are empty. The 15-point deduction reflects Agent 2's broader scope including infrastructure concerns (performance, error handling) beyond core business logic validation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,N/A,"Both outputs use Pytest framework but with different architectural approaches. Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 8) with manual cleanup in yield block (lines 18-23), while Agent 2 employs module-scoped connection fixture (line 12) with separate autouse cleanup fixture (line 22). Agent 1 implements direct SQL execution in helper functions (lines 25-45), whereas Agent 2 uses a sophisticated script execution wrapper (line 35) handling multi-statement scripts and error capture. Test organization differs: Agent 1 has simpler test functions with direct assertions (lines 67-120), while Agent 2 includes comprehensive error handling, logging configuration (line 9), and performance benchmarking (lines 158-170). The structural similarity score reflects shared Pytest foundation but different complexity levels and architectural patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,N/A,"Agent 1 demonstrates perfect syntactic correctness. All Python syntax is valid, Pytest decorators are properly used (@pytest.fixture on line 8), import statements are correct (lines 1-2), function definitions follow Python conventions, SQL statements are properly formatted within triple quotes (lines 26-32, 38-44), and variable references are consistent throughout. The code structure is clean with proper indentation, all functions are properly defined, and there are no syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,N/A,"Agent 2 also exhibits perfect syntactic correctness. All Python syntax is valid, advanced Pytest features are properly implemented (module scope fixture line 12, autouse fixture line 22), import statements include proper error handling imports (line 3), logging configuration is syntactically correct (line 9), exception handling follows Python conventions (try/except blocks lines 30-34, 104-106), and the multi-line SQL script (lines 57-75) is properly formatted. All variable references are consistent, function definitions are correct, and there are no syntax errors or undefined variables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs achieve perfect syntactic correctness with no syntax errors, undefined variables, or structural issues. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,N/A,"Consider adopting Agent 2's error handling patterns (lines 104-106, 147-149) to make tests more robust against infrastructure failures. Implement logging mechanisms similar to Agent 2 (line 9) for better test debugging and monitoring. Add performance testing capabilities like Agent 2's large dataset validation (lines 158-170) to ensure scalability. Consider module-scoped fixtures for better resource management in larger test suites."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent comprehensive testing approach. Consider adding more granular test cases for edge scenarios covered in Agent 1, such as the specific NULL department handling (Agent 1 line 91-97). The script execution wrapper (lines 35-47) could benefit from more specific error categorization to distinguish between syntax errors, permission errors, and data errors. Consider adding test case documentation strings that match Agent 1's clarity for better test maintenance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Parameterized tests to reduce code duplication across similar scenarios, 2) Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated execution, 3) Test data factories for more maintainable test data generation, 4) Coverage reporting to ensure comprehensive validation of the backup logic, 5) Database connection pooling for better performance in large test suites."
