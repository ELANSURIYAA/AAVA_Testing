Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are comprehensive Pytest test suites for validating Snowflake Employee backup logic with high semantic alignment (85/100) but notable structural differences (72/100). Agent 1 provides a simpler, more focused approach with 8 test cases, while Agent 2 offers enhanced enterprise features including logging, error handling, and performance testing across 9 test cases. Both demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with minor issues in connection handling and script execution approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15, 45-60, 80-120","Both outputs address the same core objective of testing Employee backup creation logic in Snowflake. They validate identical business scenarios including happy path testing, empty table handling, inner join validation, and NULL value processing. The primary semantic difference lies in Agent 2's additional focus on error handling (lines 95-105, 125-135) and performance validation (lines 140-155), representing enhanced enterprise requirements but maintaining core functional alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 10-25, 30-45, 70-90","Both outputs follow standard Pytest structure with fixtures, helper functions, and test cases. However, they differ significantly in architectural approach: Agent 1 uses function-scoped fixtures (line 8) while Agent 2 employs module-scoped connections with autouse cleanup (lines 20-35). Agent 2 introduces a centralized script execution model (lines 40-55) versus Agent 1's direct SQL execution approach (lines 50-70). Both maintain logical test flow but with different implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 6-12, 85-90","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper Pytest fixture syntax, valid Snowflake connector usage, and well-formed SQL statements. Minor issues include potential connection leakage in the fixture cleanup (lines 10-12) and missing error handling for database operations (lines 85-90). All test assertions are properly structured and SQL syntax is Snowflake-compatible."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 15-25, 45-50","Agent 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive error handling, proper logging configuration, and robust connection management. Minor concerns include the complex multi-statement script execution approach (lines 45-50) which may have parsing edge cases, and the hardcoded script string (lines 60-85) which reduces maintainability. All Pytest constructs are properly implemented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong syntactic foundation with Agent 2 slightly superior due to enhanced error handling and logging implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 6-12, 50-70","Enhance connection management with proper context managers, add comprehensive error handling for database operations, implement logging for better debugging, and consider adding performance validation for enterprise scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 60-85, 45-50","Refactor hardcoded script strings into external files or parameterized functions, simplify the multi-statement execution approach for better maintainability, and consider adding more granular test isolation to prevent potential side effects between complex test scenarios."
