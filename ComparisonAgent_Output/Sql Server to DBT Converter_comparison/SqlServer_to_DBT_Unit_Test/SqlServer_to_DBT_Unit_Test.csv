Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,0,N/A,"Comparison analysis could not be completed due to missing agent output content. Input contained placeholder variables instead of actual SQL Server to DBT conversion outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Semantic similarity evaluation requires actual content from both agents to compare intent and meaning in SQL Server to DBT conversion approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Structural similarity analysis requires actual code or documentation structure from both agents to evaluate logical flow and organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Agent_1,0,N/A,"No content available for syntax validation of SQL Server to DBT conversion output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Agent_2,0,N/A,"No content available for syntax validation of SQL Server to DBT conversion output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness cannot be computed without individual agent outputs to validate."
