Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent_1 delivered a comprehensive test suite with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework implementation, while Agent_2 provided only a brief statement indicating missing requirements. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to the task - one being a complete deliverable and the other being a request for clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent_1: Lines 1-95, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","The semantic similarity is extremely low. Agent_1 interprets the task as requiring delivery of complete test cases and implementation, providing comprehensive DBT/PySpark testing framework. Agent_2 interprets the task as requiring additional input (PySpark script) before proceeding. These represent fundamentally different understandings of the task requirements and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Agent_1: Lines 1-95, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","Structural similarity is minimal. Agent_1 follows a structured approach with: (1) Test Case List section with 9 numbered test cases, (2) Pytest Script section with fixtures and test functions. Agent_2 has no comparable structure - only a single paragraph statement. The organizational approaches are completely different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 32, 34, 36, 38, 76-95","Agent_1 output is syntactically correct Python/Pytest code with proper imports, fixtures, and function definitions. Minor issues: (1) Test functions contain only 'pass' statements without implementation (Lines 76-95), (2) Some test data schema assumptions may not match actual DBT model requirements (Lines 32-38). Overall structure and syntax are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 1-3","Agent_2 output is syntactically correct as a statement. The text is well-formed, grammatically correct, and clearly communicates the agent's position. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"N/A","Average correctness score: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs are syntactically well-formed within their respective contexts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 76-95","Implement actual test logic in test functions instead of 'pass' statements. Add assertions to validate expected outcomes. Consider adding more edge cases and error handling scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 1-3","Provide the requested PySpark script or attempt to generate test cases based on available SQL logic. Consider being more proactive in problem-solving rather than requesting additional inputs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"N/A","Establish clearer task requirements and input specifications upfront. Agent_1's approach of delivering a complete framework is more aligned with typical deliverable expectations, while Agent_2's request for clarification shows good requirements gathering but lacks initiative in providing alternative solutions."
