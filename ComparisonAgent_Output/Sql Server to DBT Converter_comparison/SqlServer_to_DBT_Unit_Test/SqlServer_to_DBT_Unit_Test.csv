Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","Agent_1_Complete_Output provides a comprehensive testing solution with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework implementation. Agent_2_Incomplete_Output indicates inability to proceed due to missing PySpark script requirements. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - one delivers a complete solution while the other requests clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent_1: Lines 1-100+, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","Agent_1_Complete_Output addresses the full scope of DBT testing requirements with comprehensive test cases covering validation, performance, and compliance. Agent_2_Incomplete_Output does not attempt to fulfill the testing requirements, instead indicating missing prerequisites. The semantic alignment is minimal as they serve entirely different purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Agent_1: Lines 1-100+, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","Agent_1_Complete_Output follows a structured approach with numbered test cases and organized Pytest framework. Agent_2_Incomplete_Output has no comparable structure, consisting only of a brief explanatory statement. No structural similarity exists between the outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Complete_Output,85,"Lines 45-100","Python syntax is correct with proper imports, decorators, and function definitions. Test case descriptions are well-formed. Minor issues include incomplete test implementations (pass statements) and some test data could be more comprehensive."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Incomplete_Output,95,"Lines 1-3","The response is syntactically correct and grammatically proper. The statement is clear and well-structured, though it represents incomplete task fulfillment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,"","Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective scopes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Complete_Output,,"Lines 45-100","Complete the test implementations by replacing pass statements with actual query logic and assertions. Enhance test data coverage and add edge cases for more robust validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Incomplete_Output,,"Lines 1-3","Provide the complete testing solution or clarify requirements. The current output does not fulfill the testing objectives and should include at least basic test case structures."
