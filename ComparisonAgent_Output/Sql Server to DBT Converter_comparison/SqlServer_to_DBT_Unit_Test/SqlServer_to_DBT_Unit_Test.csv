Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3,"Agent Output 1 provides a comprehensive testing solution with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework implementation. Agent Output 2 indicates inability to proceed due to missing PySpark script requirements. This represents a fundamental difference in task completion - one agent delivers a full solution while the other fails to execute the task."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3,"The outputs have completely different semantic intent. Agent Output 1 interprets the task as creating comprehensive unit tests for DBT queries with detailed test cases covering validation scenarios, performance testing, and compliance checks. Agent Output 2 focuses on the absence of a PySpark script and refuses to proceed. The semantic alignment is minimal as one provides a solution while the other provides an excuse for non-completion."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-95 vs Lines 1-3,"The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible. Agent Output 1 follows a structured format with numbered test cases (TC001-TC009) followed by a complete Python/Pytest implementation with proper fixtures, test functions, and documentation. Agent Output 2 has no comparable structure - it's a brief explanatory paragraph. There is no meaningful structural similarity between a comprehensive test suite and a refusal statement."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 1,85,Lines 10-95,"Python syntax is valid with proper imports, fixture definitions, and function structures. Minor issues include incomplete test implementations (all functions contain 'pass' statements at lines 47, 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95) and missing actual assertion logic. The framework structure and DBT testing approach are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 2,95,Lines 1-3,"The statement is syntactically correct and internally consistent. It clearly communicates the agent's position and reasoning for not proceeding. No syntax errors or structural issues present in the brief response."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective contexts, though Agent Output 1 has incomplete implementations while Agent Output 2 is complete but minimal."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 1,,Lines 47-95,"Complete the test function implementations by adding actual query execution logic and assertions. Replace 'pass' statements with meaningful test code that validates the expected behaviors described in each test case."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 2,,Lines 1-3,"Reconsider the task requirements. The instruction appears to request test case generation for DBT queries, which doesn't necessarily require a PySpark script. Attempt to provide a testing solution based on available information rather than refusing to proceed."
