Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-87 vs Lines 1-3","Agent Output 1 delivers a comprehensive testing solution with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework, while Agent Output 2 declines to proceed citing missing PySpark script requirements. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - complete task fulfillment versus task rejection."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-87 vs Lines 1-3","Agent Output 1 provides comprehensive test coverage addressing all aspects of DBT query validation including aggregations, null handling, performance, and syntax compliance. Agent Output 2 states inability to proceed without PySpark script. Semantic alignment is minimal as one agent completes the task while the other requests clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Lines 1-87 vs Lines 1-3","Agent Output 1 follows structured test case documentation (TC001-TC009) plus complete Pytest framework with fixtures and test functions. Agent Output 2 is a brief explanatory statement. No structural similarity exists between comprehensive testing framework and status message."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 1,95,"Lines 10-87","Python syntax is correct with proper imports, decorators, and function definitions. Minor deduction for incomplete test implementations (pass statements) which is acceptable for framework setup."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 2,100,"Lines 1-3","Grammatically correct and well-formed statement with proper punctuation and clear communication."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 97."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 1,,"Lines 10-87","Implement actual test logic in the pass statements. Add specific assertions for each test case. Consider adding more edge cases and error handling scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 2,,"Lines 1-3","Provide alternative solutions or clarify requirements rather than declining the task. Could suggest generating tests based on available SQL logic or request specific missing components."
