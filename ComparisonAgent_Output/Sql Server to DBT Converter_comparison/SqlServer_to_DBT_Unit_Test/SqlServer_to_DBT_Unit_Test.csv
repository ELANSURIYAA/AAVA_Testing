Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Complete provides a comprehensive solution with 9 detailed test cases and complete Pytest framework setup, while Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Incomplete indicates inability to proceed due to missing PySpark script requirements. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - complete solution delivery versus requirement clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,10,,"Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Complete delivers a complete testing solution addressing all aspects of DBT unit testing including validation of calculations, null handling, performance, and syntax compliance. Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Incomplete focuses on identifying missing requirements and requesting clarification. The semantic alignment is minimal as one provides solutions while the other identifies blockers."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,,"Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Complete follows a structured approach with numbered test cases (lines 1-27) and organized Pytest script (lines 29-95). Agent SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Incomplete uses a single paragraph format (lines 1-3) with no structured decomposition. The structural approaches are fundamentally different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Complete,85,"Lines 30-40, 95","Python syntax is valid with proper imports, decorators, and function definitions. Minor issues include incomplete test implementations (all test functions contain only 'pass' statements) and missing actual query logic implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Unit_Test_Incomplete,100,,"The response is syntactically correct, grammatically proper, and internally consistent. No syntax errors or structural issues present in the brief statement provided."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores: (85 + 100) / 2 = 92.5"
