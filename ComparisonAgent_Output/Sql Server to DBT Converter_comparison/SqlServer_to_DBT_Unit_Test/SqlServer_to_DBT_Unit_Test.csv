Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Agent_1 delivers a comprehensive testing solution with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework implementation. Agent_2 provides only a brief explanation stating insufficient input data. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - one being a complete deliverable and the other being a request for clarification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Agent_1: Lines 1-85, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","Agent_1 interprets the task as requiring complete test case generation with implementation details, while Agent_2 interprets it as requiring additional PySpark input files. The semantic alignment is minimal as they address different aspects of the same domain but with completely different understandings of deliverable scope."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"Agent_1: Lines 1-85, Agent_2: Lines 1-3","Agent_1 follows a structured approach with numbered test cases, detailed descriptions, and organized Python code with fixtures and functions. Agent_2 uses a simple explanatory paragraph structure. The structural approaches are fundamentally incompatible."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 23-85","Python syntax is valid, proper pytest structure with fixtures and decorators, correct import statements, and well-formed function definitions. Minor deduction for placeholder 'pass' statements in test implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,"Lines 1-3","The brief explanatory text is grammatically correct, properly formatted, and contains no syntax errors. The statement is internally consistent and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"All lines","Average of Agent_1 (95) and Agent_2 (100). Both outputs are syntactically correct within their respective formats and scopes."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 30-85","Implement the placeholder test logic in functions currently containing 'pass' statements. Add specific assertions and validation logic for each test case to make them executable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 1-3","Provide alternative solutions or partial implementations based on available information rather than requesting additional inputs. Consider generating template structures that could be adapted."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All lines","Establish clearer communication protocols about input requirements and deliverable expectations. Agent_1's approach of providing complete structure with placeholders is more valuable than Agent_2's request for clarification."
