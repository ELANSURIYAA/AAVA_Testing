# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent Output 1 delivers a comprehensive testing solution with 9 detailed test cases and a complete Pytest framework, while Agent Output 2 declines to proceed citing missing PySpark script requirements. The outputs represent fundamentally different approaches - complete task fulfillment versus task rejection.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 15/100)

Agent Output 1 provides comprehensive test coverage addressing all aspects of DBT query validation including aggregations, null handling, performance, and syntax compliance. Agent Output 2 states inability to proceed without PySpark script. Semantic alignment is minimal as one agent completes the task while the other requests clarification.

**Line References**: Lines 1-87 vs Lines 1-3

### Structural Similarity (Score: 10/100)

Agent Output 1 follows structured test case documentation (TC001-TC009) plus complete Pytest framework with fixtures and test functions. Agent Output 2 is a brief explanatory statement. No structural similarity exists between comprehensive testing framework and status message.

**Line References**: Lines 1-87 vs Lines 1-3

### Correctness

**Agent Output 1 (Score: 95/100)**: Python syntax is correct with proper imports, decorators, and function definitions. Minor deduction for incomplete test implementations (pass statements) which is acceptable for framework setup.

**Agent Output 2 (Score: 100/100)**: Grammatically correct and well-formed statement with proper punctuation and clear communication.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 97/100)**: Average of individual agent correctness scores.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent Output 1 | Agent Output 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 10 |
| Correctness | 95 | 100 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **70** | **67** | **68** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent Output 1**: Implement actual test logic in the pass statements. Add specific assertions for each test case. Consider adding more edge cases and error handling scenarios.

**For Agent Output 2**: Provide alternative solutions or clarify requirements rather than declining the task. Could suggest generating tests based on available SQL logic or request specific missing components.
