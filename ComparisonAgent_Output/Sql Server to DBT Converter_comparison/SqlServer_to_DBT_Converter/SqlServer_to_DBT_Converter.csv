Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-45,"Both agents successfully converted SQL Server query to DBT-compatible format using ref() functions. Agent 1 provides concise conversion with basic notes, while Agent 2 offers comprehensive documentation with warehouse-specific considerations and optimization guidance. Core SQL logic remains identical with 100% semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,1-45,"Both outputs achieve identical semantic goals: converting SQL Server query to DBT format while preserving business logic. The core transformation (raw.table_name to {{ ref('table_name') }}) is consistently applied. Both maintain the same CTE structure, joins, aggregations, and filtering logic. No semantic differences detected."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,1-45,"Nearly identical structural approach with same CTE organization (customer_orders -> order_summary -> final SELECT). Both use identical SQL constructs, join patterns, and aggregation logic. Minor structural difference: Agent 2 includes additional comment blocks and optimization notes (lines 25-45) but core query structure is preserved."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Converter_Agent1,100,1-22,"Syntactically perfect DBT SQL. All ref() functions properly formatted, CTE definitions valid, JOIN syntax correct, aggregate functions properly used. No syntax errors or undefined references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Converter_Agent2,100,1-45,"Syntactically perfect DBT SQL with extensive documentation. All ref() functions properly formatted, CTE definitions valid, SQL syntax correct throughout. Comments are properly formatted and do not interfere with query execution."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,1-45,"Both agents produce syntactically correct DBT-compatible SQL with no errors, undefined variables, or broken references. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,SqlServer_to_DBT_Converter_Agent1,,1-22,"Agent 1 provides a clean, functional conversion suitable for straightforward DBT implementations. Consider adding warehouse-specific optimization notes for production environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SqlServer_to_DBT_Converter_Agent2,,1-45,"Agent 2 delivers comprehensive documentation ideal for team environments and production deployments. The warehouse-specific considerations and optimization notes add significant value for enterprise implementations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-45,"Both outputs are production-ready. Choose Agent 1 for simple conversions, Agent 2 for comprehensive documentation needs. Consider combining Agent 1's conciseness with Agent 2's optimization insights for optimal results."
