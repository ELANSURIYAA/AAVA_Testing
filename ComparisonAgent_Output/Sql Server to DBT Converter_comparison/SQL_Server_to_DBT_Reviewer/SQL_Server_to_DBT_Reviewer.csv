Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs analyze SQL Server to DBT conversion with high accuracy. Summary_Analysis provides concise assessment while Comprehensive_Review offers detailed analysis. Both confirm successful conversion with preserved logic and functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-20 (Summary_Analysis), Lines 1-150 (Comprehensive_Review)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: evaluating SQL Server to DBT conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Summary_Analysis focuses on concise assessment while Comprehensive_Review provides exhaustive analysis. Key semantic alignment: both confirm conversion accuracy, no discrepancies found, and similar optimization suggestions (materializations, indexing, performance tuning). Minor divergence in depth and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-20 (Summary_Analysis), Lines 1-150 (Comprehensive_Review)","Structural approaches differ significantly. Summary_Analysis uses bullet-point summary format with sections: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. Comprehensive_Review uses formal report structure with markdown formatting, detailed sections, and comprehensive analysis. Both follow logical flow from assessment to recommendations but with different organizational paradigms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Summary_Analysis,95,"Lines 1-20","Summary_Analysis demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent structure, and accurate technical content. Minor issue: lacks detailed line-by-line analysis depth that could strengthen technical accuracy."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Comprehensive_Review,98,"Lines 1-150","Comprehensive_Review shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section headers, detailed technical analysis, and comprehensive coverage. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point spacing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' high technical accuracy and proper formatting with minimal syntactic issues."
