Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of SQL Server to DBT conversion. Summary_Output delivers concise technical assessment focusing on conversion accuracy and optimization recommendations. CodeReview_Output provides detailed structured analysis with extensive documentation and formatting. Both maintain consistent evaluation of conversion quality, identifying no major discrepancies, and offering similar optimization suggestions including materialization, indexing, and warehouse-specific considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-20 (Summary_Output), Lines 1-50 (CodeReview_Output)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing SQL Server to DBT conversion accuracy, identifying discrepancies, and providing optimization recommendations. Summary_Output focuses on technical accuracy with sections on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, and optimization. CodeReview_Output covers same topics but with enhanced structure including materialization configuration, warehouse-specific aggregations, and execution plan analysis. Minor semantic differences in emphasis and depth of coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-30 (Summary_Output), Lines 1-80 (CodeReview_Output)","Summary_Output uses simple section-based structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Assessment, Recommendations. CodeReview_Output employs formal report structure with markdown formatting, detailed subsections, and comprehensive documentation approach. Both follow logical progression from analysis to recommendations but differ significantly in presentation depth and formatting complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Summary_Output,95,"Lines 5-15, 25-30","Summary_Output demonstrates strong technical accuracy with valid SQL concepts, appropriate DBT terminology, and sound optimization recommendations. Minor issues include lack of specific line references for SQL code analysis and some generalized statements without detailed technical justification. All technical concepts and recommendations are syntactically and conceptually correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,CodeReview_Output,98,"Lines 10-40, 60-75","CodeReview_Output exhibits excellent technical precision with detailed code analysis, specific SQL syntax validation, comprehensive DBT feature coverage, and structured technical recommendations. Includes proper markdown formatting, consistent technical terminology, and thorough documentation standards. Minor deduction for some repetitive content in recommendations section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with comprehensive understanding of SQL Server to DBT conversion requirements. CodeReview_Output slightly superior due to enhanced technical depth and structured presentation."
