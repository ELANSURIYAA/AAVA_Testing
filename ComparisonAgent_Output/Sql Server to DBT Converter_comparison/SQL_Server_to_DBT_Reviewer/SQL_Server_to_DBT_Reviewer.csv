Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs analyze the conversion of SQL Server queries to DBT-compatible SQL. Summary_Analysis provides a concise assessment focusing on conversion accuracy and optimization suggestions. Code_Review_Report delivers a comprehensive analysis with detailed sections on conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization suggestions, and recommendations. Both outputs reach similar conclusions about conversion quality and suggest similar optimization strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-25 (Summary_Analysis), Lines 1-120 (Code_Review_Report)","Both outputs address the same core objective: evaluating SQL Server to DBT conversion quality. They share identical conclusions about conversion accuracy, lack of discrepancies, and optimization needs. However, Code_Review_Report provides more granular analysis with specific technical details about table references, query structure, and aggregations that Summary_Analysis covers more briefly. The semantic intent is highly aligned despite different levels of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-25 (Summary_Analysis), Lines 1-120 (Code_Review_Report)","Summary_Analysis follows a simple structure: Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization Suggestions, Overall Assessment, Recommendations. Code_Review_Report uses a more elaborate structure with markdown formatting, detailed sections, and subsections. Both follow logical flow from assessment to recommendations, but Code_Review_Report includes additional structural elements like API cost tracking and formal report formatting that Summary_Analysis lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Summary_Analysis,95,"Lines 1-25","Summary_Analysis is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issue: Line 15 mentions 'However, the DBT query does not include any DBT-specific optimizations' which could be more specific about what optimizations are missing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Code_Review_Report,92,"Lines 1-120","Code_Review_Report is well-structured with proper markdown syntax and consistent formatting. Minor issues: Line 35 mentions ARRAY_AGG compatibility but doesn't provide the conditional logic solution mentioned. Line 85 references API cost without context about what generated this cost."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"N/A","Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and technical accuracy. Average score reflects minor areas for improvement in specificity and context."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Summary_Analysis,N/A,"Lines 20-25","Focus on performance testing with large datasets, implement DBT materializations, review execution plans, and use DBT macros for maintainability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Code_Review_Report,N/A,"Lines 95-115","Add materialization configuration, handle warehouse-specific aggregations with Jinja, implement indexing and partitioning, test in target warehouse, and review execution plans regularly."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"N/A","Both outputs should provide more specific implementation examples for their recommendations. Summary_Analysis could benefit from the detailed technical analysis approach of Code_Review_Report, while Code_Review_Report could be more concise in its executive summary section."
