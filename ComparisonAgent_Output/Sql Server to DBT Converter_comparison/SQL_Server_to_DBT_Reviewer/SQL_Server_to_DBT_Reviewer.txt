- Consistent recommendations for DBT-specific features

Minor divergence exists in depth and presentation style, with Comprehensive_Review providing more granular technical details.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Structural approaches differ significantly between the two outputs:

**Summary_Analysis** uses a bullet-point summary format with clear sections:
- Summary
- Conversion Accuracy  
- Discrepancies and Issues
- Optimization Suggestions
- Overall Assessment
- Recommendations

**Comprehensive_Review** employs a formal report structure with:
- Markdown formatting
