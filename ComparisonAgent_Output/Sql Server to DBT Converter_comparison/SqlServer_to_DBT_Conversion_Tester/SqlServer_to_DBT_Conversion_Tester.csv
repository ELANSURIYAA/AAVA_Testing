Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50, 1-40","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case specifications for DBT-related testing but serve different purposes. The first output focuses on general DBT query validation with comprehensive pytest fixtures, while the second output targets specific SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with individual test implementations. Structural organization differs significantly - first uses centralized fixtures with placeholder implementations, second uses distributed individual test functions with complete assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-50, 1-40","Both outputs address DBT testing domain but with different primary intents. First output (lines 1-50) focuses on general DBT query validation including total orders calculation, total spent validation, and performance testing. Second output (lines 1-40) specifically targets SQL Server to DBT conversion validation including table reference conversion, syntax compatibility, and materialization configuration. Overlap exists in DBT syntax validation concepts but core purposes diverge significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50, 1-40","Both outputs follow structured test case documentation with numbered IDs, descriptions, and expected outcomes. First output organizes all tests within single comprehensive pytest script with shared fixtures (lines 10-30). Second output presents individual test cases with separate pytest implementations (lines 5-40). Documentation patterns are consistent but code organization approaches differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,85,"Lines 15-50","Valid pytest syntax with proper fixture definitions and SparkSession setup. Test functions are syntactically correct but contain placeholder 'pass' statements instead of complete implementations (lines 35-50). Fixture structure is well-designed with proper teardown and data creation patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,90,"Lines 5-40","Complete pytest implementations with proper file reading operations and specific assertions. Syntax is valid throughout with appropriate use of assert statements and string operations. Minor deduction for hardcoded file names in file reading operations which could impact maintainability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5, rounded to 88. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with the second output providing more complete implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Lines 35-50","Complete the placeholder test implementations with actual query execution and assertion logic. Consider adding more specific test data scenarios and edge cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Lines 5-40","Replace hardcoded file names with parameterized file paths for better maintainability. Consider consolidating related test functions into test classes for better organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-50, 1-40","Both outputs would benefit from standardized error handling patterns and more comprehensive test data coverage. Consider implementing shared utility functions for common test operations."
