Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two test case outputs for DBT testing with different scopes and approaches. First output provides 9 comprehensive test cases with a complete pytest framework for general DBT validation. Second output provides 10 specific test cases focused on SQL Server to DBT conversion with targeted pytest scripts. Both outputs are syntactically correct but serve different testing purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-60","Both outputs focus on DBT testing but with different semantic intents. First output (lines 1-50) provides comprehensive DBT testing including performance, joins, and general best practices. Second output (lines 1-60) specifically targets SQL Server to DBT conversion with table reference validation, syntax conversion, and warehouse compatibility. Partial semantic overlap in DBT validation concepts but different primary objectives."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-60","Both outputs follow test case list format with pytest implementations. First output uses fixture-based approach with centralized test data setup (lines 15-35) and placeholder test functions (lines 40-50). Second output uses file-based validation approach with specific assertion patterns (lines 10-60). Similar overall structure but different implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,95,"Lines 20-25, 40-50","Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper fixture definitions, SparkSession setup, and test function signatures. Minor issue: test functions contain only 'pass' statements (lines 40-50) making them incomplete implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,98,"Lines 10-60","Syntactically correct pytest scripts with proper assertions, file reading operations, and string validation. Well-formed test cases with complete implementations and specific validation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of both outputs. Both are syntactically sound with proper Python/pytest syntax and structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Complete the test function implementations by replacing 'pass' statements with actual query logic and assertions. Add specific validation for DBT ref() function usage and materialization configurations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Consider adding performance testing and edge case validation similar to first output. Include tests for large dataset handling and null value scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Combine strengths of both approaches: use fixture-based setup from first output with specific assertion patterns from second output. Standardize file naming conventions and add comprehensive documentation for test case coverage."
