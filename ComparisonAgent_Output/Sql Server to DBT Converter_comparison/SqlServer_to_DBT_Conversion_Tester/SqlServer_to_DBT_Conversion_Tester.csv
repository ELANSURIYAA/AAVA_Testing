Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided. Placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were received instead of actual content. To complete this analysis, please provide: 1) Actual Agent 1 output content, 2) Actual Agent 2 output content, 3) Context about the task these agents were performing."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically evaluate intent alignment, reasoning similarity, and outcome coherence."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically evaluate logical flow, decomposition approach, and organizational patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester_Agent1,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 1 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester_Agent2,N/A,N/A,"Cannot assess syntax-level correctness without actual Agent 2 output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent assessments."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"To enable proper comparison analysis: 1) Provide actual agent output content instead of placeholder variables, 2) Include context about the SQL Server to DBT conversion task, 3) Specify any particular validation criteria or requirements, 4) Ensure outputs are complete and properly formatted for analysis."
