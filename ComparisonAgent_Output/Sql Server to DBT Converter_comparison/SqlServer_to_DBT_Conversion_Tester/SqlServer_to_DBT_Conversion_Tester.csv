Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison due to missing or improperly formatted agent outputs. The input contained placeholder variables that were not substituted with actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Input contained placeholder variables {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} that appear to be unresolved."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without access to actual agent outputs. Both inputs appear to be placeholder variables rather than actual content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Agent1,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without access to actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Agent2,0,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without access to actual agent output content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,0,N/A,"Overall correctness score cannot be calculated without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison instead of placeholder variables. 2. Ensure proper variable substitution in the input processing pipeline. 3. Verify that agent outputs contain valid SQL Server to DBT conversion content before comparison."
