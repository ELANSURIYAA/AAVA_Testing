Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two distinct test case approaches for DBT validation. Agent_1_Comprehensive provides a framework-oriented approach with pytest infrastructure and 9 test cases covering general DBT functionality. Agent_2_Specific delivers targeted validation with 10 test cases specifically for SQL Server to DBT conversion. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency but serve different validation purposes."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Both outputs target DBT testing but with different scopes. Agent_1_Comprehensive focuses on general DBT query validation (orders, users, aggregations) while Agent_2_Specific targets SQL Server to DBT conversion specifics (ref() syntax, warehouse compatibility, materialization). Semantic overlap exists in basic DBT validation concepts but diverges in implementation focus and conversion-specific requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,N/A,"Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent_1_Comprehensive uses pytest framework with fixtures, session management, and placeholder test functions (lines 15-85). Agent_2_Specific uses direct file-based validation with assertion checks (lines 1-10 per test case). Agent_1_Comprehensive follows enterprise testing patterns while Agent_2_Specific uses simpler validation scripts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Comprehensive,85,Lines 40-85,"Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper fixtures and session management. Test functions are properly defined but contain placeholder 'pass' statements instead of implementation. Deduction for incomplete test implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Specific,95,Lines 1-150,"Syntactically correct Python test functions with proper file I/O operations and assertions. All test cases include complete implementation with specific validation logic. Minor deduction for potential file path assumptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper Python structure and DBT testing concepts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 40-85,"Implement the placeholder test functions with actual validation logic. Add specific DBT conversion validation similar to Agent_2_Specific. Consider hybrid approach combining pytest framework with specific conversion checks."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Specific,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Enhance with pytest framework structure for better test organization and reporting. Add session management and fixtures for more robust testing. Consider parameterized tests for multiple file scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Consider combining approaches: use Agent_1_Comprehensive's pytest framework with Agent_2_Specific's detailed conversion validation. Both outputs would benefit from integration testing and end-to-end validation scenarios."
