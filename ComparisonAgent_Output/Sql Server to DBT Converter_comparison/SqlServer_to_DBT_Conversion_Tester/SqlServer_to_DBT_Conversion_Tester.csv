Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Two distinct test case approaches for DBT validation: Agent_1_Output provides comprehensive DBT query testing with full pytest infrastructure including fixtures and session management, while Agent_2_Output focuses specifically on SQL-to-DBT conversion validation with file-based testing. Both outputs are syntactically correct but serve different testing purposes with moderate semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,1-150,"Both outputs target DBT testing but with different scopes. Agent_1_Output focuses on general DBT query validation (total orders, spent calculations, performance, joins) while Agent_2_Output specifically targets SQL-to-DBT conversion validation (table references, syntax conversion, materialization). Overlap exists in DBT syntax compliance (TC009 vs TC001/TC010) and basic query structure validation, but core testing objectives diverge significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,1-150,"Significant structural differences. Agent_1_Output uses comprehensive pytest architecture with fixtures (spark_session, test_data), session management, and structured test data creation. Agent_2_Output uses simple file-based testing with individual functions reading from files. Agent_1_Output has 9 test cases with placeholder implementations, Agent_2_Output has 10 test cases with complete implementations. Both follow pytest conventions but with fundamentally different approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,85,15-45,"Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper fixtures and session management. Minor issues: test functions contain only 'pass' statements (lines 67-150), missing actual test implementations. SparkSession fixture properly configured with teardown. Test data fixture correctly structured with proper DataFrame creation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,1-150,"Excellent syntax correctness with complete test implementations. All pytest functions properly defined with file reading and assertions. Minor issue: hardcoded file names (lines 8,18,28,etc.) may cause path issues in different environments. All assert statements properly structured and logical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness. Agent_2_Output slightly superior due to complete implementations vs Agent_1_Output's placeholder functions. Both follow pytest best practices and Python syntax standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,67-150,"Complete test function implementations by replacing 'pass' statements with actual query logic and assertions. Add error handling for SparkSession failures. Consider adding more specific test data scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,8-150,"Replace hardcoded file paths with configurable parameters or fixtures. Add error handling for file reading operations. Consider adding setup/teardown for test file management."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Consider hybrid approach: combine Agent_1_Output's robust test infrastructure with Agent_2_Output's specific conversion validation focus. Both could benefit from integration testing scenarios and performance benchmarks."
