Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents produced test case outputs focused on DBT testing, but with different scopes and implementation approaches. DBT_Test_Cases provides a comprehensive testing framework with 9 test cases covering general DBT functionality, data validation, and performance testing. SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester offers 10 specific test cases targeting SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with individual pytest implementations. The outputs show moderate semantic alignment but significant structural differences in their testing approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,72,All Lines,"Both outputs address DBT testing but with different semantic focuses. DBT_Test_Cases emphasizes comprehensive data validation (total orders, spending calculations, category aggregation) while SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester focuses specifically on conversion validation (table references, syntax compatibility, aggregate functions). Both share the common goal of DBT validation but approach it from different angles - general testing vs conversion-specific testing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-100,"Significant structural differences exist. DBT_Test_Cases uses a single comprehensive pytest script with fixtures and multiple test functions in one cohesive structure. SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester uses individual test cases with separate pytest scripts for each validation point. The first follows a traditional pytest structure with fixtures and session management, while the second uses standalone test functions with file reading operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DBT_Test_Cases,85,Lines 15-20,"Mostly correct pytest structure with proper fixtures and SparkSession setup. Minor issue: test functions contain 'pass' statements instead of actual implementations (lines 45-80), making them incomplete but syntactically valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester,92,Lines 10-15,"High correctness with complete pytest implementations for each test case. All test functions contain actual assertions and file operations. Minor syntax consideration: assumes specific file names exist but provides complete validation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,All Lines,"Average correctness score reflecting both agents' syntactic validity with different completion levels."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DBT_Test_Cases,N/A,Lines 45-80,"Complete the test function implementations by replacing 'pass' statements with actual query logic and assertions. Add specific validation for DBT ref() function usage and materialization configurations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester,N/A,Lines 5-10,"Consider consolidating individual test scripts into a comprehensive test suite with shared fixtures. Add error handling for file operations and validate file existence before testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both approaches have merit - combine the comprehensive fixture approach from DBT_Test_Cases with the specific conversion validation logic from SqlServer_to_DBT_Conversion_Tester for optimal DBT testing coverage."
