Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two distinct approaches to DBT testing: Agent 1 provides comprehensive SparkSession-based testing framework with complex data fixtures, while Agent 2 offers targeted SQL-to-DBT conversion validation with file-based assertions. Semantic alignment is moderate (65/100) due to different testing scopes, structural similarity is low (45/100) due to different implementation approaches, and correctness varies significantly between incomplete (Agent 1: 70/100) and complete (Agent 2: 95/100) implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-80 (Agent 2)","Both outputs focus on DBT testing but serve different purposes. Agent 1 addresses general DBT query validation including performance and data correctness, while Agent 2 specifically targets SQL-to-DBT conversion validation. The semantic overlap exists in DBT context and testing methodology, but the specific goals diverge significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 10-25 (Agent 1), Lines 5-15 (Agent 2)","Fundamental structural differences: Agent 1 employs complex pytest fixtures with SparkSession setup and comprehensive test data creation, while Agent 2 uses simple file-based validation with direct string assertions. Both follow pytest conventions but represent entirely different testing architectures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,70,"Lines 30-90","Syntactically correct pytest structure with proper fixtures and function definitions. However, all test implementations contain only 'pass' statements (lines 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91), making them incomplete. SparkSession setup is properly structured but test logic is missing."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,95,"Lines 10-80","Complete and syntactically correct pytest implementations. All test functions contain proper assertions with file reading and string validation. Minor deduction for hardcoded file paths that may not be portable across environments, but overall implementation is robust and executable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,82.5,,"Average of Agent 1 (70) and Agent 2 (95). Significant disparity due to incomplete vs complete implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Complete test implementations by replacing 'pass' statements with actual validation logic. Leverage the well-structured SparkSession fixtures and test data setup to create comprehensive DBT query validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Consider making file paths configurable or use relative paths for better portability. Add error handling for file reading operations to make tests more robust."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Consider combining approaches: use Agent 1's comprehensive data setup methodology with Agent 2's specific DBT conversion validation techniques for a more complete testing solution."
