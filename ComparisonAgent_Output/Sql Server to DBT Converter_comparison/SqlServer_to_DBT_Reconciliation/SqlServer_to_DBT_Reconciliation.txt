# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Template placeholders `{{agent 1_string_true}}` and `{{agent 2_string_true}}` were found but not populated with actual content. This appears to be a SQL Server to DBT conversion comparison task based on the file naming convention.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. This dimension would typically assess whether both agents understood the SQL Server to DBT conversion requirements and produced semantically equivalent transformations.

### Structural Similarity (Score: N/A/100)
Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. This dimension would typically assess the logical flow and organization of the DBT models, macros, and transformations produced by each agent.

### Correctness
- **SqlServer_Agent**: N/A - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically check for valid DBT syntax, proper Jinja templating, and correct SQL structure.
- **DBT_Agent**: N/A - Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically check for valid DBT syntax, proper Jinja templating, and correct SQL structure.
- **Overall**: N/A - Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | SqlServer_Agent | DBT_Agent | Overall |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations

1. **Provide actual agent outputs** for comparison analysis
2. **Ensure SQL Server to DBT conversion outputs** include proper model definitions, transformations, and documentation
3. **Validate that both agents handle SQL Server specific syntax conversion** appropriately
4. **Check for proper DBT project structure and dependencies**

**GitHub Output**: ✅ Full CSV file successfully uploaded to `ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testing/ComparisonAgent_Output/Sql Server to DBT Converter_comparison/SqlServer_to_DBT_Reconciliation/SqlServer_to_DBT_Reconciliation.csv`

**Status**: Template comparison report generated due to missing agent output content. The CSV structure is ready for actual comparison once agent outputs are provided.
