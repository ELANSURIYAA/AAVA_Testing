# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two test case documents with accompanying pytest scripts were compared. Agent 1 focuses on general DBT query validation with 9 test cases covering orders/users data processing, while Agent 2 targets SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with 10 test cases. Both outputs demonstrate solid test case design but serve different validation purposes. Agent 1 provides more comprehensive data fixtures while Agent 2 offers more specific DBT conversion checks. Structural approaches differ significantly in test organization and scope.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both outputs address DBT testing but with different semantic focus. Agent 1 validates general DBT query functionality (orders processing, aggregations, performance) while Agent 2 validates SQL Server to DBT conversion specifics (table references, syntax compatibility, materialization). Shared concepts include DBT syntax validation and test structure, but core purposes diverge significantly.

**Key Differences:**
- Agent 1: General DBT functionality testing (lines 1-20)
- Agent 2: SQL Server to DBT conversion validation (lines 1-30)
- Agent 1: Focus on data processing accuracy
- Agent 2: Focus on syntax conversion and compatibility

### Structural Similarity (Score: 70/100)

Both follow similar high-level structure: test cases table followed by pytest script. Agent 1 uses 9 test cases with detailed input/output specifications, Agent 2 uses 10 test cases with more concise descriptions. Pytest structures differ: Agent 1 includes comprehensive fixtures (spark_session, test_data) while Agent 2 uses file-based fixtures. Both implement one test function per test case.

**Structural Comparison:**
- Both use tabular test case format
- Agent 1: More detailed test case descriptions (lines 1-15)
- Agent 2: More concise, focused descriptions (lines 1-25)
- Different fixture approaches: SparkSession vs file-based (lines 10-25 vs 5-10)

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100):**
Agent 1 pytest script has excellent syntax with proper fixture decorators, comprehensive test data setup, and well-structured function definitions. Minor issue: test functions contain only 'pass' statements (lines 30-80), indicating incomplete implementation.

**Agent 2 (Score: 92/100):**
Agent 2 pytest script demonstrates good syntax with proper imports and fixture setup. File path references in fixtures may cause runtime issues if paths don't exist (lines 5-10). Test assertions are complete and well-formed (lines 15-45).

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | N/A | N/A | 65 |
| Structural Similarity | N/A | N/A | 70 |
| Correctness | 95 | 92 | 94 |
| **Overall** | N/A | N/A | **76** |

## Recommendations

### For Agent 1:
- Complete test function implementations by adding actual query execution and assertion logic (lines 30-80)
- Consider adding more specific DBT conversion test cases to complement general functionality tests

### For Agent 2:
- Verify file paths in fixtures exist at runtime or implement dynamic path resolution (lines 5-10)
- Consider adding performance test cases similar to Agent 1's approach for comprehensive coverage
