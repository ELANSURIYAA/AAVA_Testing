# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two distinct test case documents with pytest implementations addressing different validation domains. **Test_Cases_Document** focuses on user order analytics query validation (9 test cases), while **Test_Cases_Document_2** focuses on SQL Server to DBT conversion validation (10 test cases). Both outputs demonstrate proper test case structure and pytest implementation patterns but serve completely different purposes with minimal semantic overlap.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 25/100)

Both outputs are test case documents with pytest scripts, but address fundamentally different domains. **Test_Cases_Document** validates user order analytics (total orders, spending, categories), while **Test_Cases_Document_2** validates SQL Server to DBT conversion (table references, syntax compliance, materialization). The semantic overlap is limited to the shared format of test case documentation and pytest structure. The actual testing objectives, validation criteria, and business contexts are entirely different.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: test case table with ID/Description/Input/Expected Output columns, followed by pytest script with fixtures and test functions. **Test_Cases_Document** has 9 test cases (TC001-TC009) while **Test_Cases_Document_2** has 10 test cases (TC001-TC010). Both use pytest fixtures for setup, but **Test_Cases_Document** uses SparkSession fixture while **Test_Cases_Document_2** uses file reading fixtures. The pytest function naming conventions are consistent (test_* pattern) in both outputs.

### Correctness

**Test_Cases_Document (Score: 95/100)**: Pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixture definitions, and function signatures. Minor issue at lines 45-54: all test functions contain only 'pass' statements and comments, making them incomplete implementations. The SparkSession fixture and test data fixture are properly structured. Test case table format is consistent and well-structured.

**Test_Cases_Document_2 (Score: 98/100)**: Pytest script is syntactically correct with proper imports, fixture usage, and assertions. Test functions contain actual implementation with assertions and logical checks. File reading fixtures are properly defined. Test case documentation is well-structured with clear descriptions. Minor formatting inconsistency in the markdown structure but overall excellent syntax compliance.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Test_Cases_Document | Test_Cases_Document_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 25 | 25 | 25 |
| Structural Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | **66** | **67** | **67** |

## Recommendations

**For Test_Cases_Document**: Complete the test function implementations by adding actual query execution logic and assertions (lines 45-54). The current functions only contain 'pass' statements and need actual validation code to be functional test cases.

**For Test_Cases_Document_2**: Consider adding more comprehensive edge case testing and error handling scenarios. The current test cases cover the main conversion scenarios well but could benefit from additional negative test cases and boundary condition validation.

**For Both**: Both outputs serve different purposes and should be evaluated independently rather than compared directly. **Test_Cases_Document** should focus on completing test implementations, while **Test_Cases_Document_2** could expand test coverage for edge cases in SQL conversion scenarios.
