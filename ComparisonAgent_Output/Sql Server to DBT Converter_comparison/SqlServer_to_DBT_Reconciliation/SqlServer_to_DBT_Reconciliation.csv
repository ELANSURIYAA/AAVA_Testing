Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. Template placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} were found but not populated with actual content. This appears to be a SQL Server to DBT conversion comparison task based on the file naming convention."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. This dimension would typically assess whether both agents understood the SQL Server to DBT conversion requirements and produced semantically equivalent transformations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. This dimension would typically assess the logical flow and organization of the DBT models, macros, and transformations produced by each agent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically check for valid DBT syntax, proper Jinja templating, and correct SQL structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DBT_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically check for valid DBT syntax, proper Jinja templating, and correct SQL structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness score without individual agent evaluations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure SQL Server to DBT conversion outputs include proper model definitions, transformations, and documentation. 3. Validate that both agents handle SQL Server specific syntax conversion appropriately. 4. Check for proper DBT project structure and dependencies."
