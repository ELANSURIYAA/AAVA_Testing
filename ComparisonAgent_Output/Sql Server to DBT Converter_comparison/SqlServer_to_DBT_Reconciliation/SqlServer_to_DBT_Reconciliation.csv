Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two test case documents with accompanying pytest scripts were compared. Agent 1 focuses on general DBT query validation with 9 test cases covering orders/users data processing, while Agent 2 targets SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with 10 test cases. Both outputs demonstrate solid test case design but serve different validation purposes. Agent 1 provides more comprehensive data fixtures while Agent 2 offers more specific DBT conversion checks. Structural approaches differ significantly in test organization and scope."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address DBT testing but with different semantic focus. Agent 1 validates general DBT query functionality (orders processing, aggregations, performance) while Agent 2 validates SQL Server to DBT conversion specifics (table references, syntax compatibility, materialization). Shared concepts include DBT syntax validation and test structure, but core purposes diverge significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,Lines 1-100,"Both follow similar high-level structure: test cases table followed by pytest script. Agent 1 uses 9 test cases with detailed input/output specifications, Agent 2 uses 10 test cases with more concise descriptions. Pytest structures differ: Agent 1 includes comprehensive fixtures (spark_session, test_data) while Agent 2 uses file-based fixtures. Both implement one test function per test case."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-45,"Agent 1 pytest script has excellent syntax with proper fixture decorators, comprehensive test data setup, and well-structured function definitions. Minor issue: test functions contain only 'pass' statements (lines 30-80), indicating incomplete implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,Lines 20-50,"Agent 2 pytest script demonstrates good syntax with proper imports and fixture setup. File path references in fixtures may cause runtime issues if paths don't exist (lines 5-10). Test assertions are complete and well-formed (lines 15-45)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python/pytest syntax, valid table structures, and consistent formatting. Agent 1 slightly higher due to more robust fixture design despite incomplete test implementations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 30-80,"Complete test function implementations by adding actual query execution and assertion logic. Consider adding more specific DBT conversion test cases to complement general functionality tests."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 5-10,"Verify file paths in fixtures exist at runtime or implement dynamic path resolution. Consider adding performance test cases similar to Agent 1's approach for comprehensive coverage."
