Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-80","Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementations for DBT SQL conversion testing. Test_Cases_Document demonstrates a tabular approach with 9 general SQL validation test cases, while Test_Cases_Document_2 uses individual case descriptions with 10 DBT-specific conversion test cases. The pytest implementations differ significantly in detail level - Test_Cases_Document provides fixture-based structure with placeholder functions, while Test_Cases_Document_2 includes complete assertions and file-based fixtures. Both address core testing requirements but with different focuses and implementation depths."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-25 vs 1-40","Both outputs address DBT SQL conversion testing but with different semantic focuses. Test_Cases_Document emphasizes general query validation (total orders calculation, spending analysis, category aggregation) while Test_Cases_Document_2 focuses specifically on DBT conversion aspects (ref() syntax validation, materialization configuration, SQL Server compatibility removal). Both include performance testing and null handling, showing semantic overlap in core testing principles but divergent in specific testing targets."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-80","Structural approaches differ significantly. Test_Cases_Document uses tabular format for test case documentation with standardized columns (ID, Description, Input Data, Expected Output) and pytest structure with fixtures and placeholder functions. Test_Cases_Document_2 employs individual test case descriptions with detailed explanations and pytest implementation with specific assertions and file-based fixtures. Both maintain logical test organization but with fundamentally different structural paradigms."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Cases_Document,90,"Lines 26-50","Pytest syntax is valid with proper fixture definitions, function signatures, and docstrings. Table structure in test cases is well-formed with consistent columns. Minor issue: placeholder implementations in test functions reduce practical correctness but maintain syntactic validity."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test_Cases_Document_2,95,"Lines 41-80","Pytest implementation is syntactically correct with proper assertions, file handling, and test logic. Markdown formatting for test cases is valid. All function calls and string operations are properly structured. High correctness due to complete implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (90+95)/2 = 92.5, rounded to 93","Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with valid pytest implementations and well-structured documentation formats."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Cases_Document,,"Lines 26-50","Implement actual test logic in placeholder functions to increase practical value. Consider adding DBT-specific test cases to complement general SQL validation. Enhance test data fixtures with more comprehensive scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test_Cases_Document_2,,"Lines 1-40","Consider organizing test cases in tabular format for better readability and comparison. Add more general SQL validation test cases to complement DBT-specific tests. Ensure file path references are parameterized for better portability."
