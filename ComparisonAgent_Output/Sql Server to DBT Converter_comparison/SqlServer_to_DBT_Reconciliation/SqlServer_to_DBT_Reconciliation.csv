Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-80 (Agent 2)","Two distinct DBT testing approaches: Agent 1 focuses on functional query validation with business logic testing, while Agent 2 focuses on SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with syntax and structure verification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-9 (Agent 1 test cases), Lines 1-10 (Agent 2 test cases)","Both outputs address DBT testing but serve fundamentally different purposes. Agent 1 validates business logic and query functionality (orders, spending, categories), while Agent 2 validates conversion accuracy from SQL Server to DBT syntax. Limited semantic overlap despite shared DBT domain."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-80 (Agent 2)","Both follow similar high-level structure: Test Cases Document + Pytest Script + Cost. However, Agent 1 uses tabular test case format while Agent 2 uses individual case blocks. Both pytest scripts use fixtures but for different purposes - SparkSession vs file reading."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test Cases Document with Pytest Script,85,"Lines 11-50","Valid Python syntax and pytest structure. Proper fixture definitions and test function signatures. Points deducted for placeholder implementations (all test functions contain only 'pass' statements) and incomplete test data setup."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Test Cases Document with Pytest Script for SQL Server to DBT,95,"Lines 30-80","Valid Python syntax and pytest structure. Complete fixture implementations with file reading and comprehensive assertion logic. Minor deduction for hardcoded file paths that may not be portable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (85 + 95) / 2 = 90"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Test Cases Document with Pytest Script,,"Lines 11-50","Implement actual test logic in placeholder functions, add comprehensive test data scenarios, and include edge case validation for robust DBT query testing."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Test Cases Document with Pytest Script for SQL Server to DBT,,"Lines 30-80","Replace hardcoded file paths with configurable parameters, add error handling for file operations, and consider parameterized tests for multiple conversion scenarios."
