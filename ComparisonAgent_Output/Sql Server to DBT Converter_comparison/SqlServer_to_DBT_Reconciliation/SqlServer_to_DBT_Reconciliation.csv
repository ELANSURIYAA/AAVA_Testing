Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementations for DBT-related testing. Output 1 focuses on general DBT query validation with 9 test cases covering orders, users, and product data analysis. Output 2 focuses specifically on SQL Server to DBT conversion validation with 10 test cases covering syntax conversion, reference updates, and DBT-specific features. Both include complete pytest scripts with fixtures and test functions, demonstrating professional test automation practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address DBT testing but with different semantic focuses. Output 1 emphasizes data validation and query correctness for business logic (total orders, spending, categories). Output 2 emphasizes conversion validation from SQL Server to DBT syntax (ref functions, materialization, compatibility). The core intent of comprehensive testing is shared, but the specific testing domains differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-100 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow identical structural patterns: 1) Test case documentation in tabular/structured format, 2) Complete pytest script with fixtures and test functions, 3) Cost information. The pytest implementations use similar patterns (fixtures, test functions, assertions) but differ in specific test logic and data setup approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 20-25, 45-50","Python syntax is correct throughout. Minor issues: test functions contain only 'pass' statements (lines 45-50) indicating incomplete implementation. Fixture structure and imports are syntactically valid. Test data creation follows proper PySpark DataFrame patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,"Lines 15-20","Python syntax is excellent with complete test implementations. All test functions contain actual assertions and logic. Minor consideration: file path references in fixtures (lines 15-20) assume specific file locations that may not exist in all environments."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python/pytest structure, valid imports, and well-formed test patterns. Output 2 shows slightly better completeness with implemented test logic."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Complete the test function implementations by replacing 'pass' statements with actual query logic and assertions. Add specific test data scenarios for edge cases like null handling and empty datasets."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Make file path references in fixtures more flexible by using relative paths or environment variables. Consider adding more comprehensive test data scenarios to match the breadth of Output 1's test cases."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Integration of the comprehensive data scenarios from Output 1 with the complete implementation approach of Output 2, 2) Addition of performance benchmarking utilities, 3) Enhanced error handling and logging in test fixtures."
