Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Unable to perform comparison analysis as agent outputs were not provided in the input. The placeholders {{agent 1_string_true}} and {{agent 2_string_true}} appear to be empty or not populated with actual content. This analysis framework is prepared for SQL Server to DBT conversion comparison but requires actual agent outputs to proceed with semantic, structural, and correctness evaluation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate semantic similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically assess how well both agents understand SQL Server to DBT migration requirements, transformation logic, and data modeling approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate structural similarity without actual agent outputs. Would typically compare DBT model organization, macro usage, configuration approaches, and overall project structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,SqlServer_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically validate DBT model syntax, Jinja templating, YAML configuration, and SQL transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DBT_Agent,N/A,N/A,"Cannot evaluate syntax correctness without actual agent output. Would typically validate DBT model syntax, Jinja templating, YAML configuration, and SQL transformation logic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,N/A,N/A,"Cannot calculate overall correctness without individual agent evaluations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"1. Provide actual agent outputs for comparison analysis. 2. Ensure outputs include complete DBT models, configurations, and documentation. 3. Include sample data transformations and test cases for comprehensive evaluation. 4. Consider providing context about source SQL Server schema and target data warehouse requirements."
