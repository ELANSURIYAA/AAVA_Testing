Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive test case documentation and pytest implementations for DBT SQL validation, with TestCases_Document focusing on general query validation (9 test cases) and TestCases_Document_2 focusing on specific DBT conversion validation (10 test cases). The outputs show high semantic alignment in purpose but differ significantly in structural approach and implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address DBT SQL testing and validation with similar overall goals. TestCases_Document focuses on general database query validation (total orders, spending, performance) while TestCases_Document_2 specifically targets DBT conversion aspects (ref() syntax, materialization, SQL Server compatibility). The semantic intent overlaps significantly but with different emphases - general validation vs conversion-specific validation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-30 (structure), Lines 31-80 (pytest)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: Test Cases Document followed by Pytest Script. However, TestCases_Document uses tabular format for test cases while TestCases_Document_2 uses individual case blocks. Pytest implementations differ significantly - TestCases_Document uses fixtures with SparkSession while TestCases_Document_2 uses file-based fixtures and direct assertions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,TestCases_Document,85,"Lines 15-25 (data structure), Lines 45-50 (fixture setup)","Python syntax is valid with proper pytest fixture decorators and SparkSession setup. Test data structures are well-formed. Minor issue: test functions contain only 'pass' statements without actual implementations, reducing practical correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,TestCases_Document_2,92,"Lines 20-30 (assertions), Lines 35-45 (file handling)","Python syntax is fully valid with complete test implementations including specific assertions. File fixture setup is proper. All test functions contain actual validation logic rather than placeholder implementations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with TestCases_Document_2 showing slightly better implementation completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,TestCases_Document,,"Implement actual test logic in placeholder functions (lines 35-80). Add specific assertions for each test case. Consider adding DBT-specific validation similar to TestCases_Document_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,TestCases_Document_2,,"Consider adding performance testing capabilities similar to TestCases_Document (TC007). Add SparkSession-based testing for larger dataset validation. Enhance test data fixtures with more comprehensive scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from combining their strengths - TestCases_Document's comprehensive data testing approach with TestCases_Document_2's specific DBT conversion validation. Consider standardizing the test case documentation format for consistency."
