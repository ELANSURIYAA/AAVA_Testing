# **AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 WORKFLOW COMPARISON REPORT**

---

## **ERROR: INPUT VALIDATION FAILED**

---

### **Status: UNABLE TO PROCEED**

**Reason:** Required input files are not available for comparison.

---

### **Input Discovery & Validation Results:**

**Expected Inputs:**
- Output file from **AAVA 1.0** ({{AAVA_1.0_Output_File}})
- Output file from **AAVA 2.0** ({{AAVA_2.0_Output_File}})

**Validation Results:**
- ❌ AAVA 1.0 output file: **NOT FOUND**
- ❌ AAVA 2.0 output file: **NOT FOUND**

---

### **Error Details:**

The comparison and validation agent requires two input files from upstream workflow agents:
1. The output file generated by the AAVA 1.0 workflow execution
2. The output file generated by the AAVA 2.0 workflow execution

**Current Status:** Neither input file has been received through workflow bindings or is available in the knowledge base.

---

### **Required Actions:**

To proceed with the comparison and validation task, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. **Execute AAVA 1.0 Workflow Agent**
   - Generate and store output file
   - Ensure file is properly bound to workflow

2. **Execute AAVA 2.0 Workflow Agent**
   - Generate and store output file
   - Ensure file is properly bound to workflow

3. **Verify Workflow Bindings**
   - Confirm {{AAVA_1.0_Output_File}} binding is active
   - Confirm {{AAVA_2.0_Output_File}} binding is active

4. **Re-trigger Comparison Agent**
   - Once both input files are available
   - Comparison will proceed automatically

---

### **Next Steps:**

**For Workflow Orchestrator:**
- Verify that upstream agents (AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow execution agents) have completed successfully
- Check workflow binding configuration
- Ensure output files are properly passed to this validation agent

**For Development Team:**
- Review workflow execution logs
- Confirm file generation and storage mechanisms
- Validate inter-agent communication channels

---

### **Conclusion:**

**The comparison and validation process cannot be completed without the required input files.**

This agent is designed to perform analysis and reporting only, and cannot proceed without valid inputs from upstream workflow agents. No comparison, validation, or report generation is possible at this time.
