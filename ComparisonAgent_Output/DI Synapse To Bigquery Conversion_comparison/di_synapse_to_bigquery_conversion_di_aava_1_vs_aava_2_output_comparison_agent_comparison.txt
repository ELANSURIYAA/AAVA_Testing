# **AAVA 1.0 vs AAVA 2.0 WORKFLOW OUTPUT COMPARISON REPORT**

---

## **ERROR: MISSING INPUT FILES**

**STATUS: VALIDATION CANNOT BE COMPLETED**

---

### **Executive Summary**

**Overall Status:** ❌ **FAILED - INPUTS MISSING**

**Overall Matching Percentage:** N/A

**Business Logic Equivalency:** CANNOT BE DETERMINED

**Explanation:**

The comparison and validation process could not be initiated because the required input files from upstream workflow agents were not provided. Both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 output files are mandatory for performing the validation analysis.

---

### **Input Discovery & Validation Results**

**STARTING COMPARISON BETWEEN AAVA 1.0 AND AAVA 2.0 OUTPUTS**

❌ **VALIDATION FAILED**

| Input Requirement | Status | Details |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| AAVA 1.0 Output File | ❌ MISSING | File binding {{AAVA_1.0_Output_File}} not provided |
| AAVA 2.0 Output File | ❌ MISSING | File binding {{AAVA_2.0_Output_File}} not provided |
| Files Exist | ❌ NO | No input files detected |
| Files Readable | ❌ NO | Cannot verify - files not present |
| Files Not Empty | ❌ NO | Cannot verify - files not present |

---

### **Comparison Summary**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Fields Compared | 0 |
| Matched Fields | 0 |
| Mismatched Fields | 0 |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 1.0) | 0 |
| Missing Fields (AAVA 2.0) | 0 |
| Total Files Compared | 0 |

---

### **Matching Percentage**

**Overall Matching %:** N/A

**Calculation:** Cannot be calculated without input files.

**Formula:** Matching % = (Matched Fields / Total Fields Compared) × 100

---

### **Detailed Field-Level Comparison**

**Status:** No comparison performed due to missing inputs.

---

### **Missing Details**

**Fields Missing in AAVA 1.0:** Cannot be determined - input file not provided

**Fields Missing in AAVA 2.0:** Cannot be determined - input file not provided

---

### **Value Mismatches**

**Status:** No mismatches identified (no comparison performed)

---

### **Remarks**

⚠️ **CRITICAL ERROR:**

The comparison agent requires two input files to be automatically provided by upstream workflow agents through workflow bindings:

1. **{{AAVA_1.0_Output_File}}** - Output from AAVA 1.0 workflow execution
2. **{{AAVA_2.0_Output_File}}** - Output from AAVA 2.0 workflow execution

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Upstream workflow agents may not have executed successfully
- Workflow bindings may not be configured correctly
- Output files may not have been generated by previous workflow steps
- Integration between workflow stages may be broken

**Required Actions:**

1. Verify that AAVA 1.0 workflow agent has executed and produced output
2. Verify that AAVA 2.0 workflow agent has executed and produced output
3. Confirm workflow binding configuration is correct
4. Ensure output files are being passed correctly through the workflow pipeline
5. Re-execute upstream agents if necessary
6. Retry comparison once both input files are available

---

### **Final Validation Status**

**Status:** ❌ **FAIL**

**Justification:** Validation cannot be completed without required input files from upstream workflow agents. The comparison process requires both AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 output files to perform structural, field-level, and value-level analysis.

**Production Migration Recommendation:** 🛑 **DO NOT PROCEED**

Migration from AAVA 1.0 to AAVA 2.0 cannot be approved without successful validation. The workflow must be re-executed with proper input file provisioning before any migration decision can be made.
