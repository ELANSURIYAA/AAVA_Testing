Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both agents produce Python scripts for Synapse-to-BigQuery reconciliation automation. AAVA provides a more direct approach with table exports and external tables, while Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester offers a more comprehensive solution with stored procedure execution and detailed validation. Key differences include code organization, error handling sophistication, and syntax correctness. Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester demonstrates superior code quality with proper variable naming and modular structure, while AAVA contains syntax errors that would prevent execution."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both scripts address the same core reconciliation goal with similar high-level approaches: data extraction from Synapse, transfer via GCS as Parquet files, BigQuery external table creation, and reconciliation reporting. However, Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester includes stored procedure execution (lines 140-145) and more sophisticated comparison logic (lines 200-220), while AAVA focuses on direct table exports (lines 65-75). Both handle data type mismatches and NULL values, but with different implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Structural approaches differ significantly. AAVA uses a linear flow with helper functions grouped at the top (lines 35-120), followed by main logic (lines 125-180). Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester employs clear section separation with numbered phases (lines 50-300), more modular function organization, and better separation of concerns. Both use similar import structures and Google Cloud service initialization, but Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester demonstrates superior architectural planning with dedicated sections for configuration, utilities, extraction, transfer, and reconciliation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,45,"Lines 15, 95, 140, 165, 175","AAVA contains critical syntax errors that prevent execution. Variable names like 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' (lines 15, 95, 140, 165, 175) are invalid Python identifiers due to forward slashes. The script also has inconsistent string formatting in logging statements (line 85) and potential issues with undefined variables in the main execution flow. Import statements are correct, but the overall code would fail to run due to naming violations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester,92,"Lines 25, 180","Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester demonstrates high syntax correctness with proper Python variable naming, consistent import usage, and well-structured function definitions. Minor issues include a potential undefined variable 'generate__Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester.csv' function name (line 25) which appears to be a naming artifact, and one instance of inconsistent variable reference (line 180). Overall code structure is sound and would execute successfully with proper environment setup."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,69,N/A,"Average correctness score reflects the significant syntax issues in AAVA (45/100) balanced against the high-quality code in Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester (92/100). The overall correctness is heavily impacted by AAVA's execution-blocking syntax errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,N/A,"Lines 15, 95, 140, 165, 175","Critical: Fix all variable names containing forward slashes (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt) to valid Python identifiers. Recommend using underscores: ELANSURIYAA_AAVA_Testing_rt. Review and test all variable references for consistency. Improve error handling and logging structure to match enterprise standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester,N/A,"Lines 25, 180","Minor: Verify function name 'generate__Azure_Synapse_To_Bigquery_Recon_Tester.csv' for consistency and clarity. Consider shortening for better readability. Add input validation for all environment variables. Consider adding retry logic for GCS operations and BigQuery queries to improve robustness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Comprehensive unit test coverage, 2) Configuration validation at startup, 3) More detailed progress reporting for long-running operations, 4) Standardized error codes and messages, 5) Performance optimization for large dataset handling, 6) Documentation of required environment variables and setup procedures."
