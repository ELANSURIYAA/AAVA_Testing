**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a comprehensive, strictly validated comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs for the Azure Synapse to BigQuery ETL migration. All five workflow artifacts—converter, recon tester, reviewer, conversion tester, and unit test—were detected in both versions, enabling genuine one-to-one matching through multi-gate validation (intent, normalized signature, structural, and semantic analysis). Each matched component was compared line-by-line and evaluated across 10 technical dimensions. No files were unmatched or invalid, ensuring full comparison completeness. All matched pairs achieved equivalence with negligible changes and no logic or outcome differences. Migration risk is assessed as "None" across the board, supporting a confident and fully safe migration.

- All components passed multi-gate validation and matched one-to-one.
- Highest strengths: business logic, error handling, and audit mechanisms are fully preserved.
- No concerns—no unmatched or invalid files, no migration risk.
- Confidence level: HIGH, due to complete matching and equivalence.
- Recommendation: Full migration is approved; no remediation required.
- Business continuity is fully assured with zero risk.

|------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| High (≥95%)      | 5          | All gates passed with high confidence   |
| Medium (85-94%)  | 0          | All gates passed with acceptable confidence |

- 100% matching success—no unmatched or invalid files.
- Scope is fully complete; all files compared one-to-one.
- No impact from unmatched files; reliability is maximal.
- All matched pairs passed with high deterministic confidence.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Comparison was performed using deterministic line-by-line diff. The match percentage for each pair is calculated as:  
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication        |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes         |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only    |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring        |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes      |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review    |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file     |

- Match % alone is not sufficient—dimension scores provide depth.
- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.
- 90% threshold is required for unconditional PASS.
- All matched pairs exceeded 95%—no review required.
