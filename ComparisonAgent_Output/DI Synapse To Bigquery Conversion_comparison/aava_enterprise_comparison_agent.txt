**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line comparison was performed for each matched pair, identifying unchanged, added, removed, and modified lines. The match percentage was calculated as (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100, rounded to one decimal place. Only genuinely matched pairs received a match percentage; unmatched or invalid files would be marked as “N/A”.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication         |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes          |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only     |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring         |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes       |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review     |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file        |

- Match percentage quantifies line-level similarity.
- Dimension scores provide deeper functional equivalence.
- Both metrics together determine migration readiness.
- PASS threshold is set at 90% for both metrics.
