Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive reviews of Azure Synapse to BigQuery conversion with high accuracy. Agent_1 offers a concise summary focusing on key conversion points and optimization suggestions. Agent_2 provides extensive detail with structured sections covering conversion accuracy, business logic preservation, and comprehensive optimization recommendations. Both maintain consistent focus on data integrity, performance optimization, and cost considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 1-20 vs Lines 1-30,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Synapse-to-BigQuery conversion accuracy, validating business logic preservation, and providing optimization recommendations. Agent_1 focuses on essential conversion points (lines 5-15) while Agent_2 elaborates with detailed subsections (lines 10-25). Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent_1 emphasizes performance optimization, Agent_2 adds comprehensive error handling and monitoring details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-80,"Both follow similar high-level structure: Summary → Conversion Accuracy → Optimization → Cost. Agent_1 uses numbered lists for optimization suggestions (lines 25-35). Agent_2 employs detailed subsections with bullet points and structured formatting (lines 30-60). Agent_2 includes additional sections like 'Document Purpose' and more granular categorization of recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-50,"Well-formed document with consistent internal structure. All technical references are accurate (BigQuery syntax, Synapse mappings). Minor formatting inconsistencies in numbered lists (lines 25-35). All table references and optimization suggestions are technically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-80,"Comprehensive and well-structured document with excellent formatting. All technical details are accurate and detailed. Proper use of markdown-style formatting with bullet points and sections. All BigQuery and Synapse technical references are correct and detailed (lines 20-50). Minor redundancy in some explanations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Average of individual agent scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper syntax references and valid optimization recommendations."
