Agent 2 provides more structured and detailed analysis while Agent 1 offers a concise summary approach. The comparison reveals strong semantic alignment (85/100) with both agents addressing identical core objectives, moderate structural differences (70/100) due to varying levels of detail and organization, and high correctness scores (Agent 1: 95/100, Agent 2: 98/100) with excellent technical accuracy throughout.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of reviewing Azure Synapse to BigQuery conversion accuracy. They share similar focus areas including:
- Data quality checks and transformations
- Audit logging mechanisms  
- Optimization recommendations for BigQuery
- API cost estimation
- Business logic preservation validation

The semantic alignment is strong, with both agents demonstrating clear understanding of the conversion requirements. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage of technical details and business logic preservation, while Agent 1 maintains focus on essential elements with concise delivery.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 70/100)

Agent 1 follows a simpler structure with basic sections for conversion accuracy and optimization suggestions. Agent 2 employs a more sophisticated structure with:
- Metadata requirements section
- Detailed subsections with clear hierarchies
- Comprehensive documentation format
- Better organized technical analysis

Both maintain logical flow but with different levels of detail and organization. The structural differences reflect different approaches to documentation depth rather than fundamental disagreements on content organization.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 95/100):**
Content is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issue with less detailed API cost context but overall well-formed with no syntax errors or broken references.

**Agent 2 (Score: 98/100):**
Demonstrates excellent syntax and structure with comprehensive sections, proper formatting, detailed technical accuracy, and consistent terminology throughout. Very minor formatting variations but otherwise exemplary with complete technical documentation.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary
