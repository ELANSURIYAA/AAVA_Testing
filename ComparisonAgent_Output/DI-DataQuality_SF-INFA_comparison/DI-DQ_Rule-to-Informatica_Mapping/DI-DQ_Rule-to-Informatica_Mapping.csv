Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-37 vs Lines 1-1,"The two agent outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to the same task. XML_Mapping_Agent delivered a complete 37-line Informatica mapping XML with proper structure and syntax for MEMBERSDATA table processing, while DDL_Request_Agent provided a single-line status message indicating missing dependencies. This represents a complete semantic and structural divergence, with XML_Mapping_Agent demonstrating technical completion versus DDL_Request_Agent highlighting process gaps."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-37 vs Line 1,"Both outputs relate to Informatica mapping generation for data quality, but approach the task completely differently. XML_Mapping_Agent interprets the task as delivering a complete technical solution with source definitions and field mappings. DDL_Request_Agent interprets the task as requiring additional input validation before proceeding. The semantic alignment is minimal - only the shared context of DQ mapping generation connects them."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-37 vs Line 1,"Structural similarity is virtually non-existent. XML_Mapping_Agent uses hierarchical XML structure with nested elements (MAPPING > SOURCE > SOURCEFIELD), proper XML declaration, and technical metadata. DDL_Request_Agent uses plain text narrative structure. No common structural patterns, flow, or decomposition approach exists between the outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,XML_Mapping_Agent,95,Lines 1-3,"XML syntax is well-formed with proper declaration, encoding, and namespace. All XML elements are properly opened and closed. Minor deduction for incomplete mapping (line 36 indicates additional transformations needed but not provided). SOURCEFIELD definitions are syntactically correct with consistent attribute usage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DDL_Request_Agent,100,Line 1,"Plain text message is syntactically correct with proper grammar, punctuation, and clear communication. No syntax errors or malformed content detected. Message structure and formatting are appropriate for the communication type."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5. Both outputs are syntactically sound within their respective formats."

Recommendations,Recommendation,XML_Mapping_Agent,N/A,Lines 34-36,"Complete the mapping by adding the missing transformation and target definitions referenced in the XML comments. Consider adding data quality validation transformations and error handling logic to make the mapping production-ready."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DDL_Request_Agent,N/A,Line 1,"Provide the requested DDL files or implement fallback logic to generate mappings with available information. Consider adding more specific guidance on what DDL components are required and how they would be integrated."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All lines,"Establish clear task interpretation protocols to ensure both agents work toward the same deliverable type. Consider implementing a validation layer that checks for required dependencies before beginning technical implementation."
