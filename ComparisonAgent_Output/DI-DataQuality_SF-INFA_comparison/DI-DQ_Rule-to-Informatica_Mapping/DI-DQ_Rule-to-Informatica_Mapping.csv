Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-33 vs Lines 1-1,"Agent XML Output delivers a complete Informatica mapping XML with comprehensive source definitions for MEMBERSDATA table, while Agent Status Message provides an incomplete response citing missing DDL dependencies. The outputs represent fundamentally different completion states - one technical artifact versus one status message."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-33 vs Line 1,"Both outputs relate to Informatica mapping generation but serve completely different purposes. XML Output provides actual mapping implementation while Status Message explains inability to complete the task due to missing dependencies. Minimal semantic overlap as they address different aspects of the same workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,Lines 1-33 vs Line 1,"Completely different structural approaches - XML Output uses hierarchical XML structure with nested elements and attributes, while Status Message uses plain text narrative format. No structural similarity in organization, flow, or decomposition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,XML Output,95,Lines 1-33,"Well-formed XML with proper declaration, valid element nesting, consistent attribute usage, and complete source field definitions. Minor deduction for incomplete mapping (missing transformations and targets as noted in comments)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Status Message,100,Line 1,"Syntactically correct plain text message with proper grammar, clear communication, and accurate reference to missing dependencies. No syntax errors or formatting issues."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 100) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98."
Recommendations,Recommendation,XML Output,N/A,Lines 30-32,"Complete the mapping by adding transformation logic and target definitions as indicated in the XML comments. Implement the actual DQ rules referenced in the mapping description."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Status Message,N/A,Line 1,"Provide the missing DDL files (source table DDL and DQ_ISSUE_LOG DDL) to enable complete mapping generation. Consider implementing fallback logic for missing dependencies."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Establish clear workflow dependencies and validation checks to ensure all required inputs are available before initiating mapping generation processes."
