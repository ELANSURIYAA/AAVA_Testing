# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Agent XML Output delivers a complete Informatica mapping XML with comprehensive source definitions for MEMBERSDATA table, while Agent Status Message provides an incomplete response citing missing DDL dependencies. The outputs represent fundamentally different completion states - one technical artifact versus one status message.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 15/100)

Both outputs relate to Informatica mapping generation but serve completely different purposes. XML Output provides actual mapping implementation while Status Message explains inability to complete the task due to missing dependencies. Minimal semantic overlap as they address different aspects of the same workflow.

**Line References:** Lines 1-33 vs Line 1

### Structural Similarity (Score: 5/100)

Completely different structural approaches - XML Output uses hierarchical XML structure with nested elements and attributes, while Status Message uses plain text narrative format. No structural similarity in organization, flow, or decomposition.

**Line References:** Lines 1-33 vs Line 1

### Correctness

**XML Output (Score: 95/100)**
Well-formed XML with proper declaration, valid element nesting, consistent attribute usage, and complete source field definitions. Minor deduction for incomplete mapping (missing transformations and targets as noted in comments).

**Status Message (Score: 100/100)**
Syntactically correct plain text message with proper grammar, clear communication, and accurate reference to missing dependencies. No syntax errors or formatting issues.

**Overall Correctness: 98/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | XML Output | Status Message | Overall |
|--------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 5 |
| Correctness | 95 | 100 | 98 |
| **Overall** | **50** | **58** | **39** |

## Recommendations

**For XML Output:**
- Complete the mapping by adding transformation logic and target definitions as indicated in the XML comments (Lines 30-32)
- Implement the actual DQ rules referenced in the mapping description

**For Status Message:**
- Provide the missing DDL files (source table DDL and DQ_ISSUE_LOG DDL) to enable complete mapping generation
- Consider implementing fallback logic for missing dependencies

**For Both Agents:**
- Establish clear workflow dependencies and validation checks to ensure all required inputs are available before initiating mapping generation processes
