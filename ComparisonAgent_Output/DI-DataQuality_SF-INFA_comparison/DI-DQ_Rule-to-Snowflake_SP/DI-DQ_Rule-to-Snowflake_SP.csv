Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150","Both agents implement Snowflake stored procedures for data quality validation on MEMBERSDATA table. Agent 1 uses external connection approach while Agent 2 uses built-in Snowflake context. Both achieve similar DQ validation goals but with different implementation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-150","Both procedures implement identical DQ validation rules and achieve the same business objective of validating MEMBERSDATA table. Minor differences in connection handling and error management approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-150","Both follow stored procedure structure with JavaScript language. Agent 1 uses external connection pattern while Agent 2 uses built-in snowflake context. Different sequence naming and batch ID generation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,70,"Lines 15-25, 45-50","Syntax issues: External connection requires actual credentials (lines 15-19), missing error handling for connection failures, and some regex syntax may not work in Snowflake context (lines 45-50)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 20-25, 80-85","Minor issues: Some regex patterns use RLIKE which should be REGEXP (lines 80-85), but overall syntax is correct for Snowflake built-in JavaScript context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,82.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (70 + 95) / 2 = 82.5"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 15-19, 30-35","Replace external connection with built-in snowflake context for better security and performance. Add proper error handling for connection operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 80-85, 100-105","Replace RLIKE with REGEXP for better Snowflake compatibility. Consider adding more detailed error logging for individual rule failures."
