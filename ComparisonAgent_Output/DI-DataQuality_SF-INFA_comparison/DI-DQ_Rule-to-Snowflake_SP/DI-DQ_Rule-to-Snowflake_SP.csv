Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-85 vs Line 1","Agent_Complete_SP delivers a comprehensive 85-line Snowflake stored procedure implementing data quality validation with JavaScript, sequence creation, and systematic rule execution. Agent_Missing_DDL provides only a brief notification about missing DDL files. This represents a fundamental divergence in task completion - one agent produced a complete technical solution while the other identified missing prerequisites."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"Lines 1-85 vs Line 1","Severe semantic divergence. Agent_Complete_SP demonstrates full understanding of DQ validation requirements with 15 comprehensive rules covering nullability, format validation, uniqueness, and business logic constraints. Agent_Missing_DDL acknowledges the task context but does not attempt solution delivery, instead focusing on missing file dependencies. The 15% similarity reflects shared awareness of the DQ validation domain."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,5,"Lines 1-85 vs Line 1","Minimal structural alignment. Agent_Complete_SP follows standard stored procedure structure: sequence creation (lines 7-8), procedure definition (lines 10-12), JavaScript implementation (lines 13-84), and return statement (line 83). Agent_Missing_DDL uses simple declarative text structure. No comparable organizational elements exist between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Complete_SP,75,"Lines 15-22, 35, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67","Syntax issues identified: Lines 15-22 show non-standard Snowflake JavaScript SDK usage that may not work in stored procedures. Line 35 has potential variable scoping issue. Lines 47, 52, 57, 62, 67 contain regex patterns that need Snowflake-specific syntax validation. However, overall structure, SQL DDL, and JavaScript logic flow are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Missing_DDL,95,"Line 1","Syntactically correct English text with proper grammar, punctuation, and clear communication. Minor deduction for placeholder references (%2$s, %3$s) which appear to be formatting artifacts rather than intentional content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,85,,"Average of Agent_Complete_SP (75) and Agent_Missing_DDL (95). The complete procedure has technical complexity with some syntax concerns, while the brief message is syntactically sound but minimal."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Complete_SP,,"Lines 15-22, 35, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67","1. Replace JavaScript SDK connection logic (lines 15-22) with Snowflake session context. 2. Fix variable scoping for batchId (line 35). 3. Validate regex syntax for Snowflake compatibility (lines 47, 52, 57, 62, 67). 4. Add error handling for rule execution failures. 5. Consider parameterizing database/schema references for reusability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Missing_DDL,,"Line 1","1. Provide concrete next steps for obtaining missing DDL files. 2. Offer to generate template DDL structures based on inferred requirements. 3. Include partial implementation options that work with available information. 4. Specify exact file formats and naming conventions needed."
