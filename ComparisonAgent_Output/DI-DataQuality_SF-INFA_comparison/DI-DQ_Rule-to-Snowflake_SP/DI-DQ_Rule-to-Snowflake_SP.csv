Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"","The two outputs represent fundamentally different approaches to the same task. StoredProcedure_Agent delivers a complete Snowflake stored procedure implementation with comprehensive DQ rules, while RequestingAgent identifies missing dependencies and requests additional files. This represents a 15-point semantic gap, 10-point structural gap, and significant correctness differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,"","StoredProcedure_Agent provides a complete technical solution implementing 15 DQ rules with batch processing and logging capabilities. RequestingAgent acknowledges the task but requests missing DDL files before proceeding. The semantic alignment is minimal as one delivers a solution while the other identifies blockers."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,"","StoredProcedure_Agent uses a structured code approach with sequence creation (lines 7-8), stored procedure definition (lines 10-11), JavaScript implementation (lines 12-65), and systematic rule processing. RequestingAgent uses a simple explanatory text structure. No structural overlap exists between code and prose."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,StoredProcedure_Agent,75,"Lines 13-21, 23-24, 26, 30-47","Syntax issues include: JavaScript require statement invalid in Snowflake context (line 13), connection creation using Node.js SDK instead of Snowflake JavaScript API (lines 14-20), synchronous execute calls without proper result handling (lines 23-24, 26), and forEach loop with connection.execute calls that should use snowflake.execute (lines 49-56)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,RequestingAgent,100,"","The message is syntactically correct, properly formatted, and internally consistent. No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,88,"","Average of StoredProcedure_Agent (75) and RequestingAgent (100) scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,StoredProcedure_Agent,"Lines 13-21, 49-56","Replace Node.js SDK approach with native Snowflake JavaScript API. Use snowflake.execute() instead of connection.execute(). Implement proper error handling and result processing for database operations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,RequestingAgent,"Line 1","Consider providing alternative approaches or partial solutions when dependencies are missing, rather than complete blocking. Could offer template structures or pseudo-code examples."
