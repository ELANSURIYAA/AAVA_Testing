Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Comparison between DI-DQ_Complete_SP (complete Snowflake stored procedure) and DI-DQ_Incomplete_Response (request for missing files). Significant divergence in approach and completeness, with one agent providing a full solution and the other requesting additional information."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,,"DI-DQ_Complete_SP provides comprehensive DQ validation logic with 15 specific rules covering nullability, format validation, uniqueness, and referential integrity. DI-DQ_Incomplete_Response acknowledges the task but requests missing DDL files instead of attempting implementation. Fundamental difference in problem-solving approach."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,0,,"DI-DQ_Complete_SP follows standard stored procedure structure with sequence creation (lines 7-8), procedure definition (lines 10-11), JavaScript implementation (lines 13-65), and systematic rule processing (lines 35-60). DI-DQ_Incomplete_Response has no comparable structure - single paragraph text format with no code organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI-DQ_Complete_SP,85,"Lines 31, 33, 37","Minor syntax issues: Line 31 regex pattern missing proper escaping for backslashes, Line 33 REGEXP_MATCHES should be REGEXP, Line 37 similar regex escaping issue. JavaScript connection handling lacks proper error handling in lines 18-22."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI-DQ_Incomplete_Response,100,,"Grammatically correct and properly formatted message. No syntax errors in the text content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score across both agents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI-DQ_Complete_SP,,,"Fix regex patterns by properly escaping backslashes, replace REGEXP_MATCHES with REGEXP function, add comprehensive error handling for database connections, and validate connection parameters before execution."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI-DQ_Incomplete_Response,,,"Provide alternative implementation approach when files are missing, suggest default DDL structures, or attempt partial implementation with assumptions clearly documented."
