- All components failed to match one-to-one between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0.
- No valid comparison was possible due to absence of corresponding files in both directions.
- Every file is flagged as "Not Comparable" with "High" migration impact.
- The report highlights an incomplete comparison and migration risk.
- Manual intervention is required before migration can be recommended.

---

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a strictly validated comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. All files were auto-detected and processed for genuine one-to-one matching. However, none of the AAVA 1.0 files have corresponding matches in AAVA 2.0, and vice versa. As a result, no direct content comparison, match percentage calculation, or dimension scoring was possible. The comparison is therefore incomplete and cannot support confident migration decisions without further remediation. 

Note: 7 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- No valid matches found; all files are unmatched.
- No equivalence or minor difference can be claimed.
- High migration risk due to missing artifacts.
- Confidence level is low given incomplete input sets.
- Recommendation is conditional: migration not advised until gaps are addressed.
- Business continuity is not supported by current outputs.

- No file pairs met one-to-one matching criteria.
- Comparison completeness is 0%; migration confidence is minimal.
- All files are unmatched, preventing any meaningful assessment.
- Reliability of matched pairs is not applicable.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

The comparison methodology involves line-by-line analysis of genuinely matched files, calculating the percentage of unchanged lines versus total lines. Only valid one-to-one pairs are scored. Since no valid pairs exist, no match percentages are calculated. Dimension scoring is skipped for unmatched files. Both metrics are required for a PASS, with 90% as the threshold.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication         |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes          |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only     |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring         |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes       |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review     |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file     |

- No match percentages available due to lack of valid pairs.
- Dimension scores are not applicable for unmatched files.
- Both metrics are mandatory for migration readiness.
- No file met the 90% threshold for PASS.

**SECTION 9: RISK & MIGRATION READINESS**

Overall Migration Risk Level: HIGH

| Risk Factor         | Risk Level | Description                        | Mitigation                  |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Missing Artifacts   | High      | No matching files in either version| Provide corresponding files |
| Comparison Incomplete| High     | No valid matches                   | Manual review required      |
| Migration Confidence| Low       | No evidence of equivalence         | Delay migration             |

| Readiness Aspect           | Status       | Details                          |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Functional Equivalence     | NOT READY   | No comparison possible           |
| Test Coverage              | NOT READY   | No coverage assessment           |
| Performance Profile        | NOT READY   | No data available                |
| Documentation Completeness | NOT READY   | No matching documentation        |
| Prerequisites Met          | NOT READY   | Missing files                    |
| Overall Readiness Status   | NOT READY   | Migration not recommended        |

- Migration risk is high due to lack of matching components.
- Readiness status is "NOT READY" for all aspects.
- Mitigation requires provision of complete, corresponding files.
- No action can proceed until gaps are resolved.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element      | Value        |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Final Recommendation  | NOT APPROVED |
| Primary Justification | No valid comparison possible due to missing files |
| Confidence Level      | LOW          |
| Recommended Timeline  | Not recommended |
| Priority | Action Required | Responsible Team | Timeline |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| High    | Provide matching artifacts | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | Immediate |

- Migration approval is withheld due to incomplete inputs.
- Primary action is to supply missing files for both versions.
- Confidence in migration safety is low without valid comparison.
- Workflow Owner / AAVA Team must address gaps immediately.

Professional closing paragraph:  
This report applies strict input validation and deterministic comparison rules to ensure genuine, reproducible results. No migration recommendation can be made until all required artifacts are provided and valid one-to-one matches established. The current workflow outputs do not support safe migration or business continuity.

**APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL REFERENCE**

Comparison Methodology Summary:  
SHA-256 hash verification, line-by-line diff analysis, and structured 10-dimension evaluation are used for genuinely matched pairs only. All calculations follow deterministic formulas with exact rounding. No scoring or percentage is assigned to unmatched files.

Dimension Scoring Reference:  
1. Business / Functional Logic: Core outcomes  
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy: Technical correctness  
3. Data Flow & Transformations: Data processing logic  
4. Conditional / Control Logic: Branching/decision  
5. Error Handling Strategy: Exception management  
6. Performance Patterns: Efficiency  
7. Unit Test Coverage: Test completeness  
8. Output Structure & Modularity: Organization  
9. Documentation Quality: Comments/docstrings  
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence: Overall alignment  

Match Percentage Formula:  
```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:  
- PASS: >= 90%  
- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%  
- FAIL: < 75%  

File Matching Methods:  
- Level 1: Direct name  
- Level 2: Role/keyword  
- Level 3: Content similarity (>=70%)  
- Level 4: Alphabetical
