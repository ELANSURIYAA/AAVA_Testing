Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both agents produced comprehensive analysis documents for converting Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure to Fabric code. The outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment (92/100) with identical workflow understanding and similar technical recommendations. Structural similarity is high (88/100) with both following the same 6-section format, differing mainly in formatting approach. Correctness scores are excellent for both agents (95/100 each, 95/100 overall) with proper syntax and internal consistency. Key differences include Agent 1's complexity score of 35 vs Agent 2's score of 25, and Agent 1's API cost of 0.0025 USD vs Agent 2's 0.0080 USD."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in analyzing the populate_dimensions stored procedure conversion. They identify identical core components: 3 MERGE operations, same source/target tables (STG_DIMENSION_DATA to DIM_INSTITUTION/DIM_CORPORATION/DIM_PRODUCT), and similar data quality filtering approaches. Both recognize the idempotent nature of the workflow and its role in enterprise data warehousing. Minor differences include Agent 1's complexity score of 35 vs Agent 2's 25, and different API cost estimates (0.0025 vs 0.0080 USD), but these don't affect the core semantic understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with 6 main sections: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Consumption. The primary structural difference is formatting approach - Agent 1 uses bold text headers (**) while Agent 2 uses markdown headers (#). Both include complexity metrics tables with similar row structures. Agent 2 includes additional subsection headers and more detailed table formatting. The logical flow and information decomposition are highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 1-150,"Agent 1 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with consistent bold text formatting, proper table structure using pipe delimiters, and well-formed sections. All internal references are consistent, bullet points are properly formatted, and the document maintains coherent structure throughout. Minor deduction for some inconsistent spacing in table formatting and mixed use of bullet styles."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,Lines 1-150,"Agent 2 output shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, correctly structured headers (#), well-formatted tables with proper alignment, and consistent code block usage. All markdown syntax is valid and the document structure is internally consistent. Minor deduction for some table alignment inconsistencies and mixed formatting in the complexity metrics section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with their respective formatting approaches. Agent 1 uses consistent bold text formatting while Agent 2 uses proper markdown syntax. Both maintain internal consistency and proper document structure. Average correctness score reflects excellent technical writing quality with minor formatting inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Maintain the comprehensive analytical approach and detailed complexity metrics. Consider standardizing table formatting for better readability. The technical depth and accuracy are excellent."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Excellent use of markdown formatting enhances readability. Consider reconciling the complexity score methodology with other analyses to ensure consistency. The structured approach with clear headers is very effective."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide high-quality technical analysis suitable for enterprise decision-making. Consider establishing consistent complexity scoring methodology and API cost estimation approaches for future analyses. Both demonstrate strong understanding of Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion requirements."
