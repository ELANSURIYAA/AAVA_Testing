Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50","Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure conversion to Fabric code. Ascendion_AAVA provides more detailed complexity scoring (35/100) while Ascendion_AAVA_v2 provides lower complexity assessment (25/100). Both identify key conversion challenges including MERGE statement syntax, orchestration needs, and optimization opportunities. Ascendion_AAVA emphasizes enterprise data warehousing context more strongly, while Ascendion_AAVA_v2 focuses more on practical implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15, 25-35, 45-60","Both outputs address identical core objective of analyzing populate_dimensions procedure for Fabric conversion. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both identify three dimension tables as targets, (2) Both recognize MERGE operations as primary conversion challenge, (3) Both recommend refactor over rebuild approach. Minor divergences: Ascendion_AAVA emphasizes regulatory reporting context (lines 8-10), while Ascendion_AAVA_v2 focuses on data integration objectives (lines 12-15). Complexity scoring differs significantly (35 vs 25) indicating different assessment methodologies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-200","Both follow 6-section structure: Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization, API Cost. Structural differences: (1) Ascendion_AAVA uses markdown headers (**), Ascendion_AAVA_v2 uses numbered sections (#), (2) Complexity metrics table formatting differs - Ascendion_AAVA uses simple table, Ascendion_AAVA_v2 uses detailed description column, (3) Ascendion_AAVA groups high-complexity areas separately (lines 35-40), Ascendion_AAVA_v2 integrates within metrics table. Section ordering and logical flow remain consistent between outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA,95,"Lines 20-25, 180-185","Well-formed markdown structure with consistent formatting. Minor issues: (1) Line 23 - complexity score presentation could be more prominent in table format, (2) Line 182 - API cost formatting inconsistent with rest of document structure. All technical references accurate, table structures valid, no broken internal references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_v2,92,"Lines 30-35, 150-155, 190-195","Generally well-structured with proper markdown formatting. Issues identified: (1) Lines 32-35 - inconsistent table formatting in complexity metrics section, (2) Line 153 - missing period in sentence structure, (3) Lines 192-195 - API cost section formatting differs from established pattern. All technical content accurate, no syntax errors in code examples."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic quality with minor formatting inconsistencies. No critical errors affecting readability or technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA,,"Lines 35-40, 160-170","Strengthen complexity assessment methodology - current score of 35 appears high for relatively straightforward MERGE operations. Consider standardizing table formatting throughout document for better readability. Enhance API cost section integration with main content flow."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_v2,,"Lines 30-40, 150-160","Improve table formatting consistency in complexity metrics section. Standardize section header formatting to match established markdown patterns. Consider adding more detailed complexity scoring rationale to match comprehensiveness of technical analysis."
