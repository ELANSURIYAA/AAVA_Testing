Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive analyses of converting Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure to Fabric code. Agent_1 presents a more structured approach with detailed complexity scoring (35/100) and extensive optimization recommendations. Agent_2 offers similar content but with different formatting, lower complexity scoring (25/100), and more concise explanations. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of the conversion requirements and provide actionable guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1), Lines 1-45 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion. They cover identical key topics: workflow overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. Minor differences in emphasis and detail level, but fundamental understanding and intent are aligned. Agent_1 provides more detailed business context while Agent_2 focuses more on technical implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-200 (Agent_1), Lines 1-180 (Agent_2)","Both follow similar 6-section structure but with notable formatting differences. Agent_1 uses numbered sections with detailed subsections and extensive tables. Agent_2 uses markdown headers with more streamlined organization. Both maintain logical flow from overview to implementation details, but Agent_1 has more granular breakdown while Agent_2 presents more consolidated sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-60","Well-structured documentation with proper markdown formatting, accurate technical details, and consistent internal references. Minor issue: complexity score of 35 may be slightly high given the actual procedure complexity described. All syntax examples and technical recommendations are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 20-30, 50-65","Solid technical documentation with proper formatting and accurate content. Complexity score of 25 appears more realistic. Minor inconsistency in table formatting and some redundant explanations in optimization section. Overall structure and technical accuracy are strong."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy and proper documentation structure. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies and subjective scoring differences, but both provide reliable technical guidance."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 150-200","Excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed optimization techniques and clear refactor recommendation. Consider consolidating some redundant sections and validating complexity scoring methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 120-160","Strong technical analysis with practical implementation guidance. Enhance table formatting consistency and expand on error handling recommendations for production deployment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable conversion guidance. Agent_1 offers more comprehensive detail while Agent_2 provides more focused implementation advice. Consider combining Agent_1's detailed analysis with Agent_2's streamlined presentation for optimal results."
