Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-60 (Agent 2)","Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure conversion to Fabric code. Agent 1 delivers a formal structured report while Agent 2 provides more detailed markdown formatting with enhanced tables. Core technical content is highly aligned with 85% semantic overlap, covering workflow overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. Key differences include Agent 2's more detailed complexity scoring (25 vs 35) and enhanced markdown presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 5-15 (Agent 1), Lines 8-20 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address identical core objective: analyzing populate_dimensions stored procedure for Fabric conversion. Agent 1 emphasizes enterprise data warehousing operations and regulatory reporting context. Agent 2 focuses on data integration and enrichment for analytics. Both identify same input table (STG_DIMENSION_DATA) and output tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT). Minor divergence in business context framing but same technical understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 16-45 (Agent 1), Lines 25-85 (Agent 2)","Both follow 6-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Agent 1 uses formal report format with basic tables. Agent 2 employs enhanced markdown with detailed metric tables and better visual organization. Section ordering identical but presentation depth varies significantly. Agent 2 provides more granular complexity breakdown with 13 detailed metrics vs Agent 1's summary approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 20-25, 35-40","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: complexity score of 35 seems high given the stated simplicity. All technical references are accurate. Table formatting is basic but correct. No syntax errors in documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 30-80, 90-120","Excellent markdown formatting with proper table structure and consistent organization. Complexity score of 25 is more aligned with stated procedure simplicity. All technical details are accurate and well-presented. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost section but overall very well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"N/A","Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper documentation structure and accurate technical content. Agent 2 shows slightly better internal consistency and formatting quality."
