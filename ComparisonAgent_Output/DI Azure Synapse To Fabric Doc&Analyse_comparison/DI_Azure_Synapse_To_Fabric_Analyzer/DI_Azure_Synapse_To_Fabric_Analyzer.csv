Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure conversion to Fabric code. Output 1 presents a more structured approach with clear metrics table and detailed complexity scoring (35/100), while Output 2 offers similar content with enhanced business context and lower complexity score (25/100). Both reach the same conclusion recommending refactor approach over rebuild."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 1-60","Both outputs address identical core objective of analyzing populate_dimensions procedure for Fabric conversion. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both identify 3 MERGE operations on same dimension tables, (2) Both recognize data quality filtering requirements, (3) Both recommend refactor over rebuild approach, (4) Both identify same syntax conversion needs. Minor semantic differences: Output 1 emphasizes enterprise data warehousing context more heavily (lines 8-12), while Output 2 focuses more on business objectives and regulatory reporting (lines 15-18). Complexity scoring differs (35 vs 25) but reasoning aligns."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-100, 1-120","Both outputs follow similar 6-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Structural differences: (1) Output 1 uses consistent markdown headers (**1. **2. etc.) while Output 2 uses mixed formatting (# 1. # 2.), (2) Output 1 presents complexity metrics in simple table format (lines 15-30) while Output 2 uses more detailed table with descriptions (lines 25-45), (3) Output 2 includes additional subsections like 'Key Business Objective' and 'High-Complexity Areas' not present in Output 1. Overall flow and logical progression remain highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,95,"Lines 15-30, 85-90","Output 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structure, and valid metric calculations. Minor issues: (1) Inconsistent bullet point formatting in optimization section (lines 85-90), (2) Missing closing quote in API cost section (line 95). All technical content is accurate and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,92,"Lines 25-45, 100-110","Output 2 shows good syntactic correctness with proper markdown tables and formatting. Issues identified: (1) Mixed header formatting between # and ** styles (lines 1-10), (2) Inconsistent table alignment in complexity metrics section (lines 25-45), (3) Minor formatting inconsistencies in code block sections (lines 100-110). Content accuracy is high with proper technical terminology."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 94. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with minor formatting inconsistencies that do not impact content comprehension or technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Standardize bullet point formatting in optimization sections (lines 85-90) and ensure consistent markdown syntax throughout. Consider adding business context sections similar to Output 2 for enhanced stakeholder communication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Standardize header formatting to use consistent markdown syntax (either # or ** but not mixed). Improve table formatting alignment in complexity metrics section (lines 25-45) for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis suitable for enterprise migration planning. Output 1 offers more structured presentation while Output 2 provides better business context. Consider combining strengths: Output 1's structured metrics with Output 2's business objective framing for optimal stakeholder communication."
