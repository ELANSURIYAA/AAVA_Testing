Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 both outputs","Both agents successfully analyzed the Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion task with comprehensive coverage of workflow overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, optimization techniques, and cost analysis. Agent 1 provides more detailed complexity scoring (35/100) while Agent 2 offers lower complexity assessment (25/100). Both maintain professional technical documentation standards."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15, 45-60","Both outputs address identical core objective of analyzing populate_dimensions stored procedure conversion. Agent 1 emphasizes enterprise data warehousing operations and regulatory reporting (lines 8-12), while Agent 2 focuses on data integration and enrichment (lines 45-48). Both identify same three dimension tables and staging source. Minor divergence in business context emphasis but same technical understanding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 16-25, 65-85","Both follow 6-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Agent 1 uses numbered sections with markdown headers, Agent 2 uses markdown with horizontal rules. Agent 1 provides tabular complexity metrics (lines 16-25), Agent 2 uses detailed table format (lines 65-85). Same logical flow but different presentation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent_1,95,"Lines 20-35","Proper markdown formatting, valid table structure, accurate technical terminology. Minor issue: complexity score of 35 may be slightly high given the actual procedure simplicity. All syntax references and technical details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent_2,92,"Lines 70-90","Proper markdown formatting with good table structure. Complexity score of 25 is more accurate. Minor formatting inconsistency in some table cells and slight verbosity in descriptions. Technical content is accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minor presentation differences."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent_1,,"Lines 40-50","Agent 1 provides solid technical recommendations including sequential CTE approach, predicate pushdown, and modular design. Recommends refactor approach which is appropriate. Could benefit from more specific Fabric implementation details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Ascendion_AAVA_Agent_2,,"Lines 95-105","Agent 2 offers more detailed optimization techniques including specific Fabric code practices like anti-join patterns and partitioning strategies. Provides clearer refactor vs rebuild guidance with better justification."
