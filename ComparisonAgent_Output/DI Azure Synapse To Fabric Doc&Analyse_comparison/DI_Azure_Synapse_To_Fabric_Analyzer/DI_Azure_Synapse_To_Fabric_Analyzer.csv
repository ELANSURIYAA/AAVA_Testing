Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive analyses of converting Azure Synapse populate_dimensions stored procedure to Fabric code. Agent_1_Output presents a more structured approach with detailed complexity scoring (35/100) and extensive optimization recommendations. Agent_2_Output offers a more streamlined analysis with lower complexity assessment (25/100) and focused practical guidance. Both outputs correctly identify the core workflow involving three MERGE operations for dimension table maintenance, data quality filters, and the need for syntax conversion. Key differences include scoring methodology, level of detail in recommendations, and API cost reporting ($0.0025 vs $0.0080)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing and converting the populate_dimensions stored procedure from Azure Synapse to Fabric code. They share identical understanding of the workflow purpose (dimension table maintenance), business objectives (data quality and deduplication), and technical requirements (MERGE operations conversion). Minor differences exist in emphasis: Agent_1_Output focuses more on enterprise data warehousing context while Agent_2_Output emphasizes practical implementation aspects. Both correctly identify the three target dimension tables and staging source."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs follow similar 6-section structure: Workflow Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost. However, Agent_1_Output uses more detailed subsections and bullet points, while Agent_2_Output employs numbered sections with markdown formatting. Agent_1_Output includes a complexity scoring table format, whereas Agent_2_Output presents metrics in a more detailed tabular structure. The logical flow and information architecture are comparable but presentation styles differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 15-25,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues include some formatting inconsistencies in the complexity metrics table. All technical references are accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,90,Lines 20-30,"Agent_2_Output shows good syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and clear section delineation. Some minor formatting inconsistencies in code blocks and table alignment. Technical content is accurate but presentation could be more polished."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Both outputs maintain high standards of technical accuracy and proper formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor presentation issues in both outputs but strong overall quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,Lines 45-60,"Leverage the detailed complexity scoring methodology and comprehensive optimization techniques. The structured approach to manual adjustments provides clear implementation guidance. Consider adopting the enterprise context framing for stakeholder communication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,Lines 35-50,"Utilize the streamlined presentation format and focused practical guidance. The clear separation of high-complexity areas identification is valuable. The modular approach to recommendations enhances readability and implementation planning."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs provide valuable complementary perspectives. Agent_1_Output offers depth and enterprise context, while Agent_2_Output provides clarity and practical focus. Combining both approaches would yield optimal results for Azure Synapse to Fabric conversion projects."
