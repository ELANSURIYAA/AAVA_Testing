Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both agents provide comprehensive Fabric cost and testing effort estimates for Synapse to Fabric conversion, but with dramatically different cost projections and effort estimates. Agent 1 estimates $45-75 monthly runtime costs and 28-36 total hours, while Agent 2 estimates $1.60 per run and 11 total hours. The outputs share similar structural organization but differ significantly in cost calculation methodology and effort granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All Lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Fabric conversion costs and testing efforts. They cover identical sections (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing, Output Validation, API Costs) and analyze the same populate_dimensions stored procedure. However, they diverge significantly in cost calculation approaches - Agent 1 uses monthly recurring estimates while Agent 2 focuses on per-execution costs. The semantic intent is aligned but implementation perspectives differ substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with matching section headers, subsection numbering (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3), and logical flow. Both use similar formatting conventions, bullet points, and cost breakdown presentations. The primary structural difference is Agent 2's inclusion of a summary table (lines 45-50) which Agent 1 lacks. Overall document architecture and information hierarchy are highly consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Fabric_Plan_Agent1,95,Lines 15-20,"Agent 1 output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid cost calculations. Minor issue: complexity score reference (35/100) appears without prior definition or context (line 15). All other technical details, cost breakdowns, and effort estimates are internally consistent and properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Fabric_Plan_Agent2,98,All Lines,"Agent 2 output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent structure, and well-formatted summary table. All cost calculations are mathematically sound, technical specifications are accurate, and document formatting is pristine. No significant syntax or formatting issues identified."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with only minor contextual reference issues in Agent 1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Fabric_Plan_Agent1,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Provide context or definition for the complexity score (35/100) referenced in cost justification. Consider clarifying the relationship between monthly costs and per-execution costs for better stakeholder understanding."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_Fabric_Plan_Agent2,N/A,Lines 25-30,"Consider providing monthly cost projections in addition to per-execution costs to align with typical enterprise budgeting cycles. The single-run focus may not address ongoing operational cost planning needs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Significant cost estimate variance (45x difference) requires reconciliation. Recommend establishing common assumptions for data volume, execution frequency, and Fabric capacity sizing. Both approaches have merit but need alignment on calculation methodology and time horizons for enterprise decision-making."
