Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 provide comprehensive Fabric cost and testing effort estimates for Synapse to Fabric conversion, but with significantly different cost models and effort calculations. Agent_1 focuses on monthly runtime costs ($45-75 USD) while Agent_2 provides per-execution costs ($1.60 USD). Both outputs are well-structured documentation with similar sections but divergent quantitative assessments."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Fabric conversion costs and testing effort. However, they interpret the costing model differently - Agent_1 uses monthly recurring costs while Agent_2 uses per-execution costs. The semantic intent is aligned but the financial modeling approach creates conceptual differences in cost interpretation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with sections for Cost Estimation (1.1 Fabric Runtime Cost), Code Fixing and Testing Effort (2.1-2.3), and API Cost Consumption. The logical flow and decomposition approach are very similar, with minor differences in subsection organization and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-25,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and well-formed cost calculations. Minor issue: complexity score reference (35/100) appears without clear context definition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,90,Lines 20-30,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting and consistent structure. Issues include: inconsistent data volume references (150 GB vs 650 GB vs 700 GB) and some formatting inconsistencies in the summary table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,N/A,"Average correctness score of 92.5, rounded to 93. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with minor formatting and consistency issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-25,"Clarify the complexity score methodology and provide context for the 35/100 rating. Consider adding per-execution cost breakdown alongside monthly estimates for better comparison with alternative costing models."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 20-30,"Resolve data volume inconsistencies throughout the document (150 GB vs 650 GB references). Standardize formatting in summary tables and ensure consistent decimal precision in cost calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized costing methodology (monthly vs per-execution), 2) Clear assumptions documentation, 3) Sensitivity analysis for different data volumes, 4) Integration of both costing approaches for comprehensive planning."
