Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Two comprehensive Fabric migration cost and effort estimation reports with significantly different conclusions. Agent_1_Report estimates $45-75 monthly runtime costs and 28-36 hours total effort, while Agent_2_Report estimates $1.60 per run and 11.0 hours total effort. Both analyze the same populate_dimensions stored procedure but use different cost models and complexity assessments. Semantic similarity is high (85/100) as both address migration planning, but structural approaches differ substantially (70/100). Both reports are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All Lines,"Both outputs address Synapse to Fabric migration cost estimation and effort planning for the same stored procedure. Core semantic alignment includes: cost estimation methodology, manual fix effort breakdown, output validation requirements, and API cost tracking. Key semantic differences: Agent_1_Report uses monthly recurring cost model ($45-75/month) while Agent_2_Report uses per-execution cost model ($1.60/run). Agent_1_Report assumes complexity score 35/100 and nightly execution frequency, while Agent_2_Report focuses on single execution scenarios. Both correctly identify MERGE operations as primary conversion challenge and include similar business rule validation requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,70,Lines 1-50,"Both reports follow similar high-level structure with Cost Estimation, Code Fixing sections, and API costs. However, significant structural differences exist: Agent_1_Report uses 4-tier cost breakdown (Fabric Compute, Storage, Network, Performance Optimizations) while Agent_2_Report uses simpler 3-component model (Complexity, Data Volume, Execution Time). Agent_1_Report provides detailed effort breakdown with 4 sub-categories (6-8h, 4-5h, 3-4h, 3h) while Agent_2_Report uses 4 categories with different time allocations (4.5h, 0.5h, 1.0h, 1.0h). Validation sections differ: Agent_1_Report has 3 validation activities (6-8h, 4-5h, 2-3h) vs Agent_2_Report's 2 activities (3.0h, 1.0h)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Report,100,All Lines,"Syntactically correct throughout. All numerical calculations are consistent, section headers are properly formatted, cost breakdowns sum correctly ($40-65 + $3-7 + $2-3 = $45-75), effort calculations are accurate (16-20 + 12-16 = 28-36 hours). Markdown formatting is proper, bullet points are consistent, and all references to stored procedure elements are accurate. No syntax errors, undefined terms, or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Report,100,All Lines,"Syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section structure, and accurate numerical calculations. Cost calculation is mathematically sound (2 hours × $0.80/hour = $1.60). Effort totals are correct (7.0 + 4.0 = 11.0 hours). Table formatting is proper, bullet points are consistent, and all technical references are accurate. API cost calculation properly documented. No syntax errors or formatting inconsistencies found."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,All Lines,"Both reports demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, calculation mistakes, or structural inconsistencies. Average correctness score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Report,N/A,Lines 15-25,"Strengths: Comprehensive monthly cost modeling with detailed breakdown including storage and network costs. Thorough effort estimation with granular task breakdown. Good consideration of execution frequency and performance optimizations. Areas for improvement: Cost assumptions need validation against actual Fabric pricing tiers. Complexity scoring methodology (35/100) should be documented with clear criteria."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Report,N/A,Lines 10-20,"Strengths: Clear per-execution cost model with specific capacity assumptions. Detailed technical analysis of MERGE to upsert conversion requirements. Concise effort breakdown with specific task allocations. Areas for improvement: Single-run cost model may not reflect production usage patterns. Should consider ongoing operational costs beyond single execution. Data volume assumptions (650 GB) need validation against actual environment."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both reports would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost modeling approach (monthly vs per-execution), 2) Validation of data volume and complexity assumptions, 3) Integration of performance optimization impact on costs, 4) Consideration of both development and operational phases, 5) Risk assessment for cost and effort overruns. Recommend combining Agent_1_Report's comprehensive operational view with Agent_2_Report's detailed technical conversion analysis."
