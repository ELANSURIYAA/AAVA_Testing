Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents provide comprehensive Fabric cost and testing effort estimates for Synapse to Fabric conversion. Agent_1 estimates higher monthly runtime costs ($45-75 USD) and significantly higher manual effort (28-36 hours) compared to Agent_2 ($1.60 per run, 11 hours total). Key differences include cost calculation methodology (monthly vs per-run), data volume assumptions, and effort estimation approaches. Both outputs are syntactically correct and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,All,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Fabric conversion costs and testing effort. However, they differ significantly in cost calculation approach - Agent_1 uses monthly recurring costs while Agent_2 uses per-execution costs. Agent_1 assumes nightly execution (30 runs/month) while Agent_2 focuses on single execution. Both include similar effort categories (manual fixes, validation) but with different hour estimates. The semantic intent is aligned but execution details vary substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Cost Estimation section with Fabric Runtime Cost subsection, Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation with Manual Fixes and Output Validation subsections, Total Estimated Effort, and API Cost Consumption. Agent_1 includes additional performance optimization details and more granular cost breakdowns. Agent_2 includes a summary table format for effort estimation. Overall structure and logical flow are highly similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Agent_1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid cost calculations. Minor issue: complexity score reference (35/100) appears without prior definition context."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,All,"Agent_2 output is syntactically correct with excellent markdown formatting, consistent structure, proper table formatting, and all calculations are internally consistent and well-documented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and internal consistency. Agent_2 slightly edges out with better table formatting and more explicit calculation documentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 15-20,"Provide context for complexity score reference (35/100) to improve clarity. Consider adding summary table format similar to Agent_2 for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Consider providing more detailed performance optimization insights and cost breakdown granularity similar to Agent_1 to enhance comprehensiveness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents should align on cost calculation methodology (monthly vs per-run) and clarify execution frequency assumptions. Consider hybrid approach showing both per-execution and monthly costs for better stakeholder understanding."
