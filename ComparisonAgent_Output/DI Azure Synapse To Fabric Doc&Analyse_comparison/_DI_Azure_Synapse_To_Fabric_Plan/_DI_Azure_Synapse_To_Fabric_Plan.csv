Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Fabric cost and testing effort estimates for Synapse to Fabric conversion but with significantly different cost models and effort calculations. Agent_1_Output focuses on monthly recurring costs ($45-75 USD) while Agent_2_Output provides per-execution costs ($1.60 USD). Effort estimates vary substantially: Agent_1_Output estimates 28-36 hours total vs Agent_2_Output's 11 hours total."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating Fabric conversion costs and testing effort. However, they interpret the costing model differently - Agent_1_Output uses monthly recurring cost model while Agent_2_Output uses per-execution model. Both include similar sections (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing, Testing Effort, API Cost) but with different underlying assumptions about data volume and execution frequency."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with same main sections: Cost Estimation (1.1 Fabric Runtime Cost), Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation (2.1 Manual Fixes, 2.2 Output Validation, 2.3 Total Effort), and API Cost Consumption. Both use similar formatting with headers, bullet points, and cost breakdowns. Minor differences in subsection organization and table presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 15-45,"Syntactically well-formed with consistent formatting, proper markdown structure, and complete sections. Minor issue: complexity score reference (35/100) mentioned but not clearly defined in context. All cost calculations are internally consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,92,Lines 20-50,"Well-structured with proper formatting and complete sections. Contains formatting inconsistency in effort summary table and some unclear data volume references (650 GB vs 150 GB source data). API cost calculation explanation is clearer than Agent_1_Output."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs are syntactically correct with minor formatting and consistency issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 15-45,"Clarify the complexity scoring methodology (35/100) and provide more detailed breakdown of the monthly cost model assumptions. Consider adding per-execution cost alternative for comparison."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 20-50,"Resolve data volume inconsistencies (650 GB vs 150 GB) and improve table formatting in the effort summary section. The per-execution cost model is clearer but should include monthly projection scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-150,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized costing methodology (monthly vs per-execution), 2) Consistent data volume assumptions, 3) Cross-validation of effort estimates, 4) Inclusion of both costing models for comprehensive analysis."
