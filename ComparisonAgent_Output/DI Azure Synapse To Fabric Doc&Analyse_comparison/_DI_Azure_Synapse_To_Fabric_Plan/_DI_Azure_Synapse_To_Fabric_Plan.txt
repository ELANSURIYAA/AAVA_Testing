# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive Fabric cost and testing effort estimates for Synapse to Fabric conversion, but with significantly different cost models and effort calculations. Agent_1 focuses on monthly runtime costs ($45-$75) while Agent_2 provides per-execution costs ($1.60). Major discrepancies exist in effort estimates: Agent_1 estimates 28-36 hours total vs Agent_2's 11 hours. Both outputs are structurally sound and syntactically correct.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 65/100)

Both agents address the same core objective of estimating Fabric conversion costs and testing effort, but apply fundamentally different cost calculation approaches. Agent_1 uses monthly recurring cost model with capacity-based pricing, while Agent_2 uses per-execution cost model with CU-based pricing. Both include similar business logic validation requirements but differ significantly in effort time estimates and cost justifications.

**Key Differences:**
- **Cost Model**: Agent_1 projects $45-$75 monthly recurring costs vs Agent_2's $1.60 per-execution model
- **Effort Estimates**: Agent_1 estimates 28-36 total hours vs Agent_2's 11 hours
- **Data Volume Assumptions**: Agent_1 assumes 10K-50K records per dimension table vs Agent_2's 650GB total processing volume
- **Execution Frequency**: Agent_1 assumes nightly execution (30 runs/month) vs Agent_2's single-run focus

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: Cost Estimation section with Fabric Runtime Cost subsection, Code Fixing and Testing Effort section with Manual Fixes and Output Validation subsections, Total Effort calculation, and API Cost section. The logical flow and decomposition approach are highly aligned, with both using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 2.1, etc.) and similar subsection breakdowns.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Identical section hierarchy and numbering scheme
- Similar subsection organization within each major section
- Consistent use of bullet points and cost breakdown presentations
- Both include justification paragraphs following cost estimates

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 95/100)**
Minor formatting inconsistency in cost range presentation ($45 - $75 vs $45-$75) at lines 15-17, but otherwise syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid cost calculations.

**Agent_2 (Score: 98/100)**
Excellent syntactic correctness with consistent formatting, proper markdown structure, well-formatted tables, and accurate mathematical calculations throughout all sections.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**
Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section structure, and accurate calculations. Minor formatting variations in Agent_1 do not impact overall quality.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 65 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | 80 | 81 | 81 |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:**
- Standardize cost range formatting for consistency (lines 20-25)
- Consider providing both monthly and per-execution cost models to align with Agent_2's approach for better cost transparency

**For Agent_2:**
- Consider adding monthly cost projections alongside per-execution costs to provide comprehensive cost planning perspective similar to Agent_1's approach (lines 35-40)

**For Both Agents:**
- Align on cost calculation methodology and effort estimation approaches
- Consider hybrid model combining monthly capacity costs with per-execution granularity
- Validate effort estimates against industry benchmarks for Synapse to Fabric migrations
