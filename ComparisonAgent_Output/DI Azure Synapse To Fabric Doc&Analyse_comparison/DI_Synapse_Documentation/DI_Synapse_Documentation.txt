# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the populate_dimensions stored procedure in Azure Synapse Analytics. The documentation covers dimension table loading from staging data with business rules and data quality filters. Both outputs demonstrate strong semantic alignment (95/100) with identical core purpose and technical approach. Structural similarity is high (88/100) with Agent_2 using numbered sections while Agent_1 uses descriptive headers. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each) with proper formatting and internal consistency. The overall assessment shows excellent alignment with minor presentation differences.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs address the identical stored procedure with same business purpose: loading dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) from STG_DIMENSION_DATA. Core concepts are perfectly aligned including MERGE operations, data quality filters, idempotency, and business rules. Minor semantic differences include Agent_1 emphasizing 'regulatory reporting' while Agent_2 mentions 'regulatory and compliance reporting' (line 8 vs line 9). Both describe identical transformation logic and data lineage. The 5-point deduction reflects slight variations in emphasis and terminology choices.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow similar logical flow: Overview, Structure, Data Flow, Mapping, Transformation, Complexity, Outputs. Key structural difference: Agent_2 uses numbered sections (1-7) while Agent_1 uses descriptive headers without numbers (lines 1-10). Data mapping tables are structurally identical with same columns and row organization (lines 50-80). Complexity analysis tables maintain same structure and metrics (lines 120-130). The 12-point deduction reflects the section numbering difference and slight variations in subsection organization within main sections.

### Correctness

**Agent_1 (Score: 100/100):** Perfect syntactic correctness. All markdown formatting is valid, table structures are properly formatted with consistent column alignment, bullet points are correctly structured, and internal references are consistent. No broken links, malformed tables, or syntax errors detected.

**Agent_2 (Score: 100/100):** Perfect syntactic correctness. Markdown formatting is valid throughout, numbered sections are properly structured (1-7), table formatting is consistent and well-aligned, and all internal references are accurate. No syntax errors detected.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1 | Agent_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **94** | **94** | **94** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1:** Consider adopting numbered section headers (1. Overview, 2. Structure, etc.) to improve document navigation and professional presentation, similar to Agent_2's approach.

**For Agent_2:** Consider including more specific complexity scoring rationale as shown in Agent_1 (complexity score 35 vs 25) to provide better analytical depth.

**For Both:** Both outputs could benefit from including version control information and last updated timestamps to improve document maintenance and tracking.
