Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the populate_dimensions stored procedure. Agent_1 provides a more structured approach with numbered sections, while Agent_2 uses descriptive headers. Both cover the same core functionality with slight variations in presentation and complexity scoring."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50, 75-100","Both outputs describe identical stored procedure functionality, business rules, and data transformations. Minor differences in emphasis on enterprise vs regulatory reporting (Agent_1 mentions regulatory reporting more prominently). Core intent and meaning are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-20, 60-80","Both follow similar documentation structure with overview, data flow, mapping tables, and complexity analysis. Agent_1 uses numbered sections (1-7) while Agent_2 uses descriptive headers. Agent_1 includes API cost section that Agent_2 lacks. Overall flow and logical decomposition are very similar."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 150-180","Excellent formatting, consistent table structures, proper markdown syntax. Minor issue: API cost section format could be more consistent with rest of document structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,"Lines 140-170","Very good formatting and structure. Consistent use of numbered sections. Minor inconsistency in complexity score (25 vs 35) without clear justification for the difference."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97.5,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both documents are well-formatted with minor presentation inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 180-200","Maintain the comprehensive API cost tracking. Consider standardizing the format of the cost section to match other sections. The regulatory reporting emphasis is valuable for compliance contexts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 160-180","The numbered section structure enhances readability. Consider adding API cost information for completeness. Justify the complexity score difference (25 vs 35) with specific criteria."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both documents would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology, 2) Consistent section formatting, 3) Cross-validation of technical details like complexity scores to ensure accuracy."
