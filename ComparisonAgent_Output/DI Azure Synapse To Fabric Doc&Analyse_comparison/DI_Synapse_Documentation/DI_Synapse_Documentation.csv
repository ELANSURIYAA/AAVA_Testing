Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the populate_dimensions Synapse stored procedure. Agent 1 presents a more technical approach with detailed complexity scoring (35), while Agent 2 uses numbered sections and lower complexity scoring (25). Both cover identical functional requirements with 95% semantic alignment, 88% structural similarity, and high syntactic correctness. Key differences include organizational style, complexity assessment methodology, and API cost reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-150,"Both outputs address the same core objective: documenting the populate_dimensions stored procedure for Azure Synapse Analytics. They share identical understanding of the procedure's purpose (loading dimension tables from staging data), business rules (filtering test/legacy data), and technical implementation (MERGE statements). Minor semantic differences include Agent 1's emphasis on 'regulatory reporting' vs Agent 2's 'regulatory and compliance reporting' (lines 8-10), and slight variations in describing the procedure's integration context. Both correctly identify the three target dimension tables and data quality filters."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-150,"Agent 1 uses unnumbered sections with descriptive headers, while Agent 2 employs numbered sections (1-7). Both follow similar logical flow: Overview → Structure → Data Flow → Mapping → Transformation → Complexity → Outputs. Agent 1 includes a dedicated 'Code Structure and Design' section, while Agent 2 combines this into 'Component Structure and Design'. The data mapping tables are structurally identical with same column headers and row organization. Agent 2 adds more detailed subsection organization within sections 3 and 5. Both use consistent table formatting and bullet point structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,98,1-150,"Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues include inconsistent spacing in the data mapping table (lines 45-70) and one instance of incomplete sentence structure in the complexity analysis section (line 120). All technical references to SQL constructs, table names, and Azure Synapse features are syntactically correct. API cost format is properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,96,1-150,"Agent 2 shows strong syntactic correctness with numbered section headers, proper markdown formatting, and consistent table structures. Minor issues include inconsistent capitalization in section headers (lines 15, 35) and slight formatting inconsistencies in the complexity analysis table (lines 110-125). One instance of redundant phrasing in the transformation logic section (line 95). All technical references are syntactically accurate. API cost reporting format is correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, accurate technical terminology, and consistent formatting. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies and stylistic variations rather than fundamental syntax errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,45-70,"Standardize spacing and alignment in data mapping table for improved readability. Consider adding numbered sections for better navigation consistency with enterprise documentation standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,15-35,"Ensure consistent capitalization in section headers. Review complexity scoring methodology to align with Agent 1's more detailed technical assessment approach for better accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-150,"Both outputs provide high-quality documentation suitable for enterprise use. Consider establishing unified formatting standards for future documentation projects. The semantic alignment suggests both agents correctly understand the technical requirements, making either suitable for production use with minor formatting adjustments."
