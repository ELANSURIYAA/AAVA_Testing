Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions'. They cover identical functional scope including three dimension table loads (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) with data quality filters and MERGE operations. Key differences include structural organization (numbered vs unnumbered sections), complexity scoring (35 vs 25), and API costs (0.0025 vs 0.008 USD). Both outputs maintain high technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical business requirements for dimension table population with same data sources, targets, and business rules. Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Output 1 focuses more on enterprise integration aspects while Output 2 emphasizes automation and consistency. Both correctly identify the same filtering criteria and MERGE operations."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Section headers: Output 1 lines 7,15,29,45,67,89,103 vs Output 2 lines 7,17,33,49,71,93,109","Both follow similar logical flow but with different organizational approaches. Output 1 uses descriptive section headers while Output 2 uses numbered sections (1-7). Data mapping tables are structurally identical. Main difference is in complexity analysis presentation and section ordering."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,"Line 95: Overall Complexity Score = 35","Excellent syntax and internal consistency. All table references, column names, and SQL constructs are correctly formatted. Minor inconsistency in complexity scoring methodology not clearly defined."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,96,"Line 111: Overall Complexity Score = 25, Line 127: API Cost format","High syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and consistent internal references. Slight inconsistency in complexity score (25 vs 35 from Output 1) and different API cost format presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent technical accuracy with proper SQL syntax references, consistent table/column naming, and well-structured documentation format. Average correctness score reflects minor inconsistencies in scoring methodologies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach. Consider adding explicit complexity scoring methodology definition. Standardize API cost presentation format for consistency across documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Excellent numbered section organization enhances readability. Reconcile complexity scoring differences with Output 1. Consider adding more enterprise integration context as shown in Output 1."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs are production-ready documentation. Recommend establishing standard templates for complexity analysis and API cost reporting to ensure consistency across similar procedures. Consider combining the numbered structure from Output 2 with the enterprise focus from Output 1."
