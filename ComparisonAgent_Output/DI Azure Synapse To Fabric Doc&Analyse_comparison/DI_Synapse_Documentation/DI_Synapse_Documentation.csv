Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions'. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical core purpose and business logic. Structural similarity is good (78/100) despite different section numbering and organization approaches. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and consistent internal references. Key differences include section numbering schemes, complexity scoring (35 vs 25), API costs (0.0025 vs 0.008 USD), and minor variations in descriptive language."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address the identical stored procedure with the same core understanding: loading dimension tables from staging data using MERGE statements with data quality filters. Business rules, data flow logic, and transformation requirements are consistently described across both outputs. Minor semantic differences include emphasis on specific aspects (e.g., 'regulatory reporting' vs 'regulatory analytics') and slight variations in describing the same technical concepts."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-15 vs 1-12,"Both outputs follow comprehensive documentation structure but with different organizational approaches. Agent 1 uses descriptive headers while Agent 2 uses numbered sections (1-7). Both include identical core sections: Overview, Structure/Design, Data Flow, Data Mapping tables, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. The data mapping tables are structurally identical with same columns and row organization. Main structural difference is section numbering and header formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,100,N/A,"Syntactically perfect documentation with consistent internal references, properly formatted tables, valid markdown structure, and no broken references or formatting errors. All technical details are accurately presented."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,100,N/A,"Syntactically perfect documentation with consistent internal references, properly formatted tables, valid markdown structure, and no broken references or formatting errors. All technical details are accurately presented with numbered section organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,N/A,"Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adopting numbered sections for better navigation and readability as seen in Agent 2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,N/A,"Excellent structured documentation with clear numbered sections. The complexity score of 25 may be slightly underestimated compared to Agent 1's more detailed analysis (35)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs represent high-quality documentation standards. Consider standardizing on section numbering approach and complexity scoring methodology for consistency across documentation artifacts. Both could benefit from including actual SQL code snippets for better technical reference."
