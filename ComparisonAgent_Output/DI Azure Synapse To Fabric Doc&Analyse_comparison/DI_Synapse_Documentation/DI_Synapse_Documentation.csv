Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation for the Azure Synapse stored procedure 'populate_dimensions'. The documents are semantically equivalent with 95% similarity, describing identical business logic, data flow, and transformation rules. Structurally, they share 88% similarity with consistent section organization but different numbering schemes. Both documents demonstrate high correctness (98% and 96% respectively) with proper formatting and accurate technical details. The primary differences lie in presentation style, complexity scoring methodology, and minor structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,,"Both documents describe the identical stored procedure with the same purpose: loading and maintaining dimension tables (DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT) from STG_DIMENSION_DATA. Business rules are consistently documented across both outputs: institution_id validation (NOT NULL, LEN > 3), corporation test exclusion (UPPER(corporation_name) NOT LIKE 'TEST%'), and product legacy filtering (processing_group NOT IN ('DEPRECATED', 'LEGACY')). Data flow logic, MERGE operations, and idempotency concepts are semantically identical. Minor differences in phrasing and emphasis do not affect core meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both documents follow similar documentation patterns with overview, design, data flow, mapping, transformation, complexity, and outputs sections. Agent_1_Output uses unnumbered sections while Agent_2_Output uses numbered sections (1-7). Data mapping tables are structurally identical with same columns and formatting. Agent_2_Output includes additional subsection organization in some areas. Both maintain consistent logical flow from high-level overview to detailed technical specifications. Section ordering and content organization are highly aligned despite formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,1-150,"Document demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and accurate technical references. All internal cross-references are valid. Table formatting is consistent throughout. Minor issue: API cost placement at end could be better integrated into document structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,96,1-160,"Document shows strong syntactic correctness with proper section numbering, consistent formatting, and valid markdown structure. All technical details are accurately presented. Minor issues: Some inconsistency in bullet point formatting (lines 25-30), and complexity score differs from Agent_1_Output (25 vs 35) without clear justification for the variation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both documents demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal structure, and accurate technical content. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies and structural placement issues that do not impact overall document quality or usability."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,"Consider adding numbered sections for better navigation and reference. Integrate API cost information into a dedicated metadata or appendix section rather than placing at document end. Maintain current high-quality technical accuracy and comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,"Standardize bullet point formatting throughout document (lines 25-30). Provide clear justification for complexity score methodology to ensure consistency with similar analyses. Consider adding more detailed cross-references between sections for improved navigation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both documents provide excellent technical documentation quality. Consider establishing a standardized template for future stored procedure documentation to ensure consistent formatting and section organization. Both outputs successfully meet enterprise documentation standards for data engineering components."
