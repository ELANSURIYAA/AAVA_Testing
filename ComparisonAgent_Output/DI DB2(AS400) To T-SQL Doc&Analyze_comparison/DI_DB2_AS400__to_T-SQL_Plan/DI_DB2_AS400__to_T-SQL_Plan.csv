Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_Detailed), Lines 1-60 (Agent_Concise)","Both outputs provide effort estimation for DB2 to T-SQL migration focusing on manual code fixes and data reconciliation testing. Agent_Detailed estimates 12 hours total while Agent_Concise estimates 9.75 hours (rounded to 10). Key differences include level of detail in breakdown and specific technical considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-35 (Agent_Detailed), Lines 8-40 (Agent_Concise)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: estimating effort for DB2 to T-SQL migration including manual code fixes and data reconciliation. However, they diverge significantly in final estimates (12 vs 9.75 hours) and technical depth. Agent_Detailed provides more comprehensive analysis of cursor handling and exception management, while Agent_Concise offers more granular time breakdowns per specific task."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_Detailed), Lines 1-60 (Agent_Concise)","Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: header with metadata, main sections for manual code fixes and data reconciliation testing, and summary totals. Agent_Detailed uses bullet-point format throughout, while Agent_Concise incorporates a formatted table (lines 45-50) and more structured subsections. Both conclude with effort summaries but Agent_Concise adds planning notes."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Detailed,95,"Lines 1-50","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper bullet points, and clear section headers. Minor issue: some redundancy in final summary section (lines 45-50) where total is restated multiple times."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_Concise,98,"Lines 1-60","Excellent formatting with proper markdown table structure, consistent section headers, and clear organization. All internal references are valid and formatting is professional throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation formatting and internal consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Detailed,,"Lines 8-35","Consider adopting more granular time breakdown approach similar to Agent_Concise for better project planning accuracy. The 12-hour estimate may be conservative but provides good buffer for unforeseen issues."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_Concise,,"Lines 8-40, 55-60","The 9.75-hour estimate appears more precise but may benefit from additional buffer time as noted in Agent_Detailed's approach. The tabular format and planning notes add professional value."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized estimation methodology, 2) Risk factor considerations, 3) Dependency mapping, 4) Resource skill level assumptions. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_Detailed's comprehensive analysis with Agent_Concise's structured presentation."
