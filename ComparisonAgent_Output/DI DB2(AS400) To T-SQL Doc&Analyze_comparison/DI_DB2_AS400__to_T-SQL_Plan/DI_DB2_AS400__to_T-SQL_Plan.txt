# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide effort estimation for DB2 to T-SQL migration focusing on manual code fixes and data reconciliation testing. Agent_Detailed estimates 12 hours total while Agent_Concise estimates 9.75 hours (rounded to 10). Key differences include level of detail in breakdown and specific technical considerations.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Both outputs address identical core objectives: estimating effort for DB2 to T-SQL migration including manual code fixes and data reconciliation. However, they diverge significantly in final estimates (12 vs 9.75 hours) and technical depth. Agent_Detailed provides more comprehensive analysis of cursor handling and exception management (lines 8-20), while Agent_Concise offers more granular time breakdowns per specific task (lines 8-25). The 25-point deduction reflects the substantial difference in final estimates and approach granularity.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: header with metadata, main sections for manual code fixes and data reconciliation testing, and summary totals. Agent_Detailed uses bullet-point format throughout, while Agent_Concise incorporates a formatted table (lines 45-50) and more structured subsections. Both conclude with effort summaries but Agent_Concise adds planning notes (lines 55-60). The 15-point deduction is due to different formatting approaches and organizational styles.

### Correctness

**Agent_Detailed: 95/100**
Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper bullet points, and clear section headers. Minor issue: some redundancy in final summary section (lines 45-50) where total is restated multiple times.

**Agent_Concise: 98/100**
Excellent formatting with proper markdown table structure, consistent section headers, and clear organization. All internal references are valid and formatting is professional throughout.

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_Detailed | Agent_Concise | Overall |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_Detailed:**
Consider adopting more granular time breakdown approach similar to Agent_Concise for better project planning accuracy. The 12-hour estimate may be conservative but provides good buffer for unforeseen issues.

**For Agent_Concise:**
The 9.75-hour estimate appears more precise but may benefit from additional buffer time as noted in Agent_Detailed's approach. The tabular format and planning notes add professional value.

**For Both:**
Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized estimation methodology, 2) Risk factor considerations, 3) Dependency mapping, 4) Resource skill level assumptions. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_Detailed's comprehensive analysis with Agent_Concise's structured presentation.
