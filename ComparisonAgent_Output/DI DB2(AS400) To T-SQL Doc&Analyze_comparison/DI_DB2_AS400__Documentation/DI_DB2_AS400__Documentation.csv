Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for Db2 (AS400) to T-SQL migration components addressing the RETURN_DEPT_SALARY procedure. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (88/100) with identical business logic coverage, strong structural similarity (92/100) following the same 7-section format, and excellent correctness (100/100) with no syntax errors. Key differences include Agent 2's more explicit T-SQL focus and slightly more detailed transformation descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-150 (both agents)","Both outputs address identical migration goals and business logic for departmental salary aggregation and bonus counting. Agent 1 provides broader migration context while Agent 2 focuses specifically on T-SQL conversion. Core semantic content including data flow, transformation logic, and complexity analysis are highly aligned. Minor differences in emphasis on target platform specificity and migration scope details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-150 (both agents)","Nearly identical 7-section structure with matching headers: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Both follow consistent logical decomposition and flow. Minor structural differences in subsection organization within Component Structure (lines 15-35) and slight variations in table formatting approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DB2_AS400_Agent1,100,"Lines 1-150","Syntactically correct documentation with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid table structures, and no broken links or formatting errors. All section numbering is sequential and appropriate."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DB2_AS400_Agent1,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach while considering more explicit target platform specifications as demonstrated in Agent 2's output. The broader migration context provided is valuable for enterprise documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DB2_AS400_Agent2,,"Excellent T-SQL-specific focus enhances clarity for implementation teams. Consider incorporating broader migration context elements from Agent 1 to provide more comprehensive enterprise-level documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs represent high-quality migration documentation. Consider standardizing on Agent 2's explicit target platform approach while incorporating Agent 1's broader enterprise context for optimal documentation completeness."
