# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents produced comprehensive DB2 to T-SQL conversion analysis reports with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (88/100). Employee_Salary_DB2 achieved 95/100 correctness while 1772125004483599500_Employee_Salary_DB2 achieved 98/100 correctness, resulting in 96.5/100 overall correctness. Key differences include enhanced formatting and more precise metrics in Agent 2's output.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing DB2 stored procedure RETURN_DEPT_SALARY for T-SQL conversion. Core technical analysis is semantically equivalent - both identify 7-8 syntax differences, complexity score of 35/100, and refactor recommendation. Minor semantic differences include Agent 2's more detailed business objective description (lines 8-11) and slightly different API cost calculations (0.002 vs 0.0040 USD).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical 7-section structure: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Agent 2 provides enhanced formatting with markdown tables (lines 25-32), better section separation with horizontal rules, and more detailed subsection organization. Agent 1 uses simpler formatting but maintains same logical flow.

### Correctness

**Employee_Salary_DB2 (Score: 95/100)**
Minor inconsistency in line count reporting (38 lines including header vs actual content). All technical analysis is accurate including complexity metrics, syntax differences identification, and conversion recommendations. Internal references are consistent throughout.

**1772125004483599500_Employee_Salary_DB2 (Score: 98/100)**
More precise line count reporting (33 total, 23 code-only). Enhanced accuracy in metrics reporting with clear distinctions. All technical analysis is accurate with improved formatting and organization. Minimal issues detected.

**Overall Correctness: 96.5/100**
