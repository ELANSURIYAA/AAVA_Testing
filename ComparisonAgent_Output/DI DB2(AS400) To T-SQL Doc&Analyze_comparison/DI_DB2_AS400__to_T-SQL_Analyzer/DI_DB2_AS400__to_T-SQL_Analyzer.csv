Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents produced comprehensive DB2 to T-SQL conversion analysis reports with high semantic alignment (92/100) and structural similarity (88/100). Employee_Salary_DB2 achieved 95/100 correctness while 1772125004483599500_Employee_Salary_DB2 achieved 98/100 correctness, resulting in 96.5/100 overall correctness. Key differences include enhanced formatting and more precise metrics in Agent 2's output."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing DB2 stored procedure RETURN_DEPT_SALARY for T-SQL conversion. Core technical analysis is semantically equivalent - both identify 7-8 syntax differences, complexity score of 35/100, and refactor recommendation. Minor semantic differences include Agent 2's more detailed business objective description (lines 8-11) and slightly different API cost calculations (0.002 vs 0.0040 USD)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 7-section structure: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost. Agent 2 provides enhanced formatting with markdown tables (lines 25-32), better section separation with horizontal rules, and more detailed subsection organization. Agent 1 uses simpler formatting but maintains same logical flow."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Employee_Salary_DB2,95,Lines 15-16,"Minor inconsistency in line count reporting (38 lines including header vs actual content). All technical analysis is accurate including complexity metrics, syntax differences identification, and conversion recommendations. Internal references are consistent throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1772125004483599500_Employee_Salary_DB2,98,Lines 12-13,"More precise line count reporting (33 total, 23 code-only). Enhanced accuracy in metrics reporting with clear distinctions. All technical analysis is accurate with improved formatting and organization. Minimal issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96.5,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with Agent 2 showing slightly superior precision in metrics and formatting."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Employee_Salary_DB2,N/A,All,"Improve metrics precision and consider adopting enhanced formatting similar to Agent 2. Verify line count accuracy in complexity metrics section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,1772125004483599500_Employee_Salary_DB2,N/A,All,"Maintain current high standard of formatting and precision. Consider standardizing API cost calculation methodology for consistency across analyses."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both agents demonstrate strong technical analysis capabilities. Recommend standardizing formatting approach and metrics calculation methodology to ensure consistency across similar analysis tasks."
