Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Hive to BigQuery migration. Output_1 presents a concise analysis with clear calculations, while Output_2 provides more detailed explanations and formatting. Key similarities include identical BigQuery runtime costs ($5.85 USD) and API costs, though effort estimates differ (45 vs 25 hours). Both outputs are well-structured and address the same core requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs address identical migration analysis goals with highly similar cost calculations and methodologies. Minor differences in effort estimation approach (Output_1: 45 hours total, Output_2: 25 hours total) and level of detail in explanations. Core semantic intent and conclusions are nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,All,"Both follow similar three-section structure (Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing, API Cost). Output_2 includes additional formatting elements like markdown tables, bullet points, and summary sections. Output_1 uses simpler numbered structure while Output_2 has more hierarchical organization with subsections and detailed breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,Lines 1-35,"Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issue: Uses 'GB' and 'TB' units inconsistently in calculations (line 8: '500 GB * 10% = 50 GB' should align with TB conversions). All calculations are mathematically correct and references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,Lines 1-89,"Excellent formatting and structure with proper markdown syntax, consistent unit usage, and comprehensive documentation. All calculations are accurate, references are properly formatted, and the summary table provides clear consolidation of results."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with only minor formatting inconsistencies in Output_1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,Lines 8-12,"Standardize unit usage throughout calculations (consistently use TB or convert GB to TB). Consider adding summary table for better readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,Lines 1-89,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider condensing some explanatory text for more concise presentation while maintaining the detailed breakdown structure."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide valuable migration analysis. Output_2's detailed formatting and comprehensive explanations make it more suitable for stakeholder presentations, while Output_1's concise approach is better for quick reference. Consider combining Output_1's brevity with Output_2's formatting standards for optimal results."
