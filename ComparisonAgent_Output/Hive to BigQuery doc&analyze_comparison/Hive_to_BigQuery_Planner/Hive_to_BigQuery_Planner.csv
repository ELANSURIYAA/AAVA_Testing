Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-50,"Both agents provide comprehensive cost estimation reports for Hive to BigQuery migration. Agent 1 delivers a concise analysis with total testing effort of 45 hours, while Agent 2 provides more detailed breakdown with 25 hours total effort. Both reach identical BigQuery runtime costs ($5.85) but differ in API costs and effort estimation methodology. Agent 2 demonstrates superior documentation structure and detailed cost justification."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs address identical migration cost estimation goals with same BigQuery runtime calculations ($5.85). Key semantic differences: Agent 1 estimates 45 hours total effort vs Agent 2's 25 hours. Agent 1 reports API cost $0.005 vs Agent 2's $0.0123. Both use same data volume assumptions (10% processing) and storage calculations. Semantic alignment strong on core objectives but divergent on effort estimation methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-50,"Both follow three-section structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost. Agent 1 uses simple bullet points and basic formatting. Agent 2 employs markdown formatting, detailed subsections, summary tables, and comprehensive breakdowns. Agent 2 includes performance tuning considerations absent in Agent 1. Structural flow identical but presentation sophistication differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,Lines 15-20,"Minor calculation presentation issues: ORDER_ITEMS and PRODUCTS listed as 500GB each but should be 0.5TB for consistency. All mathematical calculations correct. Formatting adequate but basic."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 10-25,"Excellent mathematical accuracy and consistent unit usage (TB/GB). Minor formatting inconsistency in summary table alignment. All calculations verified correct including detailed breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and accurate calculations. Agent 2 shows superior attention to detail and consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 25-35,"Strengthen effort estimation methodology with detailed breakdowns. Improve documentation formatting and add performance tuning considerations. Verify API cost calculation accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 40-50,"Excellent comprehensive approach. Consider aligning effort estimates with industry standards. Minor formatting consistency improvements in summary tables recommended."
