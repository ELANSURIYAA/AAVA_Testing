Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-45 (Agent 1), Lines 1-89 (Agent 2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Hive to BigQuery migration. Agent 2 provides significantly more detailed breakdown and structured presentation with 89% more content. Key differences: Agent 1 estimates 45 hours total effort vs Agent 2's 25 hours, and API costs differ ($0.005 vs $0.0123). Both reach identical BigQuery runtime costs of $5.85 USD."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-10 (both agents), Lines 25-35 (effort estimation)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: BigQuery cost estimation, code fixing effort, testing effort, and API costs. Semantic alignment is strong with same data volume calculations (0.37 TB scanned, $1.85 query cost, $4.00 storage). Main semantic divergence occurs in effort estimation methodology - Agent 1 uses broad categories (10+15+20 hours) while Agent 2 uses granular task breakdown (11+5+3+6 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-3 (section headers), Lines 15-25 (cost breakdowns)","Both follow similar high-level structure: 1. Cost Estimation, 2. Code Fixing/Testing Effort, 3. API Cost, Summary. Agent 2 provides more sophisticated organization with markdown formatting, tables, and detailed subsections. Agent 1 uses simple bullet points while Agent 2 employs hierarchical numbering, bold headers, and summary tables. Flow logic is identical but presentation depth differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 5-12 (calculation accuracy)","Mathematically accurate calculations throughout. BigQuery cost computation correct: 0.37 TB * $5 = $1.85, storage 200GB * $0.02 = $4. Minor presentation issues: inconsistent units (GB vs TB mixing in line 8-10) and less detailed breakdown of effort categories."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,98,"Lines 15-35 (detailed calculations), Lines 60-75 (effort breakdown)","Highly accurate with comprehensive mathematical validation. Excellent unit consistency, detailed cost reasoning, and thorough effort breakdown. Minor deduction for slight complexity in presentation that could introduce readability challenges. All calculations verified and cross-referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high mathematical accuracy and internal consistency. Agent 2 shows superior attention to detail and presentation standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,75,"Lines 25-35 (effort estimation)","Expand effort estimation with granular task breakdown similar to Agent 2. Add structured formatting and detailed reasoning for each cost component. Include performance tuning considerations and edge case handling in testing estimates."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,90,"Lines 80-89 (summary table)","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider adding risk factors and assumptions documentation. Minor suggestion to simplify some complex nested formatting for better readability across different viewing platforms."
