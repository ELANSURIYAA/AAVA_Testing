Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Both agents successfully provide comprehensive cost estimation for Hive to BigQuery migration. Agent 1 estimates 45 hours total effort while Agent 2 estimates 25 hours with more detailed breakdown. Both arrive at identical BigQuery runtime costs of $5.85 USD but differ in API costs ($0.005 vs $0.0123). Agent 2 provides superior formatting and documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-45,"Both outputs address identical core requirements: BigQuery runtime cost calculation, testing effort estimation, and API cost reporting. Same calculation methodology for data scanning (10% of table sizes) and identical final BigQuery cost ($5.85). Difference in effort estimates (45 vs 25 hours) and API costs reduces semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-45,"Both follow similar overall structure with Cost Estimation, BigQuery Runtime Cost, Code Fixing sections, and Summary. Agent 2 provides more detailed subsection breakdown with markdown formatting, summary table, and clearer organization. Agent 1 uses simpler bullet-point structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,Lines 8-12,"Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points and inconsistent spacing. Mathematical calculations are correct. Some sections lack clear delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,Lines 1-45,"Excellent markdown formatting throughout. Proper table structure in summary. All mathematical calculations verified. Minor issue with inconsistent decimal precision in API cost."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,Lines 1-45,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor formatting differences."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Improve formatting consistency and add clearer section delineation. Consider adding summary table for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Excellent structure and formatting. Consider reconciling effort estimates with industry standards and validating API cost precision."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,Lines 1-45,"Both agents should align on effort estimation methodology. Agent 2's detailed breakdown approach is preferred. Consider standardizing API cost reporting precision."
