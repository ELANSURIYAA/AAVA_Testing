Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Hive to BigQuery migration. Output_1 presents a structured numerical analysis while Output_2 provides enhanced formatting with detailed breakdowns and summary tables. Core calculations and conclusions are identical across both outputs with $5.85 USD total cost and similar effort estimates. Key difference lies in presentation style and level of detail."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All Lines,"Both outputs address identical migration scenario with same cost calculation methodology ($5/TB BigQuery scanning, 10% data processing assumption). Core semantic elements perfectly aligned: data volumes (CUSTOMERS: 2TB, ORDERS/ORDER_ITEMS/PRODUCTS: 0.5TB each), final cost calculation ($1.85 query + $4.00 storage = $5.85), and effort estimation approach. Minor semantic difference in API cost values ($0.005 vs $0.0123) and effort hour totals (45 vs 25 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50,"Both outputs follow identical high-level structure: Cost Estimation → Code Fixing/Testing Effort → API Cost → Summary. Output_1 uses numbered hierarchical sections (1, 2.1, 2.2, 3) while Output_2 employs markdown formatting with headers and tables. Output_2 includes additional structural elements like detailed breakdown tables (lines 35-45) and summary table (lines 47-55). Core logical flow and information organization remain consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,Lines 8-12,"Syntactically correct documentation with proper numerical calculations and consistent internal references. Minor issue: GB to TB conversion presentation could be clearer (shows '50 GB' in calculation but should clarify as '0.05 TB' for consistency with final total)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,100,All Lines,"Fully correct documentation with proper markdown syntax, consistent data type representations, well-formatted tables, and clear numerical calculations. All internal references are consistent and formatting is professional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average correctness score of 98 and 100 equals 99. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and consistent internal logic."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,N/A,Lines 8-12,"Improve unit consistency in calculations by showing GB values converted to TB format throughout. Consider adding summary table for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,N/A,Lines 25-30,"Excellent formatting and presentation. Consider standardizing API cost methodology to align with other similar analyses."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both outputs provide solid foundation for migration planning. Recommend reconciling effort hour estimates (45 vs 25 hours) and API cost calculations ($0.005 vs $0.0123) to establish consistent baseline for future analyses."
