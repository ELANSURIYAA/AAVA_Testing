Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both agent outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Hive to BigQuery migration. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical core calculations and conclusions. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with consistent three-section organization despite formatting differences. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper formatting and consistent calculations. Key convergence: BigQuery runtime cost $5.85, similar effort estimation approaches, and comparable API cost reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-45 (Output 1), Lines 1-78 (Output 2)","Both outputs address identical migration objectives with highly aligned reasoning. Core calculations match exactly: BigQuery cost $5.85, data scanning 0.37TB, storage cost $4.00. Effort estimation approaches are semantically equivalent though with different hour allocations (45 vs 25 hours total). Minor semantic divergence in API cost values ($0.005 vs $0.0123) and detailed breakdown granularity. Both demonstrate same understanding of BigQuery pricing model and migration complexity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-45 (Output 1), Lines 1-78 (Output 2)","Both follow identical three-section structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost. Section 1 uses same subsection 2.1 for BigQuery costs. Section 2 maintains consistent 2.1 and 2.2 subdivision pattern. Output 2 provides more granular subsection breakdowns and includes summary table (lines 65-78). Both use bullet points and hierarchical organization. Main structural difference is Output 2's enhanced formatting with markdown elements and detailed summary table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_1,100,"Lines 1-45","Syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent mathematical calculations, and no broken references. All numerical values are properly formatted and calculations are internally consistent (0.37TB * $5 = $1.85, total $5.85). Effort hours sum correctly (10+15+20=45). No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_2,100,"Lines 1-78","Syntactically correct with enhanced markdown formatting, proper table structure, and consistent calculations. All mathematical operations are accurate and well-formatted. Effort breakdown sums correctly (11+5+3+6=25). Markdown table syntax is proper (lines 65-72). No syntax errors, broken references, or formatting inconsistencies detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"All lines","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no errors in formatting, calculations, or internal references. Average correctness score: (100+100)/2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_1,N/A,"Lines 35-45","Consider adopting more detailed effort breakdown structure similar to Output 2. Add summary table for better readability. Enhance formatting with markdown elements for improved presentation. Provide more granular subsection organization for complex calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_2,N/A,"Lines 60-65","Maintain excellent detailed breakdown approach. Consider standardizing API cost reporting format to match organizational standards. Ensure effort estimation methodology aligns with project management frameworks. Continue using comprehensive summary tables for stakeholder communication."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All lines","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy and comprehensive analysis. Recommend establishing standardized template combining Output 1's conciseness with Output 2's detailed formatting. Align API cost reporting methodology across agents. Consider implementing automated validation for calculation consistency. Both approaches are production-ready with minor presentation optimizations needed."
