Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs provide comprehensive cost estimation and effort analysis for Hive to BigQuery migration. Agent_2 delivers significantly more detailed breakdown with enhanced formatting, clearer explanations, and more granular effort estimates. While both reach similar cost conclusions ($5.85 USD BigQuery runtime cost), Agent_2 provides superior documentation quality and professional presentation with markdown formatting, detailed reasoning, and structured tables."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical migration cost estimation goals with highly aligned semantic intent. Agent_1 calculates BigQuery runtime cost as $5.85 USD (lines 8-12), while Agent_2 reaches the same $5.85 USD conclusion (lines 25-27) using identical data scanning methodology. Both estimate similar effort ranges: Agent_1 estimates 45 total hours (line 22) vs Agent_2's 25 hours (line 67), with the difference primarily in reconciliation effort estimates (20 vs 6 hours). API costs differ slightly: $0.005 vs $0.0123 USD. Core semantic alignment is strong with minor variations in effort breakdown granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: Cost Estimation → Code Fixing/Testing Effort → API Cost → Summary. However, Agent_2 demonstrates superior structural organization with markdown formatting, numbered sections, bullet points, and summary tables (lines 69-76). Agent_1 uses plain text with basic indentation (lines 1-25), while Agent_2 employs professional documentation structure with clear subsections, detailed breakdowns, and formatted tables. Agent_2 includes additional structural elements like 'Reasons' explanations and 'Notes' sections that enhance readability and comprehension."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 6-7, 10","Agent_1 shows minor formatting inconsistencies in data volume representations (mixing TB and GB units without consistent conversion) and has a calculation discrepancy in line 10 where '50 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 10 GB' should equal 170 GB, not the implied 0.17 TB shown in total calculation. Text formatting is plain but syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 12-18","Agent_2 demonstrates superior formatting and presentation with proper markdown syntax, consistent unit representations, and clear mathematical breakdowns. Minor issue with data volume consistency in lines 12-18 where some values are presented in different formats (0.5 TB vs 500 GB) but calculations remain mathematically sound. Professional documentation structure with proper headers, tables, and formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong technical accuracy with Agent_2 showing superior presentation quality and formatting consistency."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Improve formatting consistency, use proper markdown structure, provide more detailed effort breakdowns, and ensure mathematical calculations are clearly presented with consistent unit representations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain current high-quality documentation standards. Consider standardizing data volume representations (consistent TB vs GB usage) and ensure all numerical breakdowns are explicitly shown in calculations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from including confidence intervals for effort estimates, risk factors that could affect costs, and assumptions documentation. Consider adding validation checkpoints and success criteria for the migration effort estimation process."
