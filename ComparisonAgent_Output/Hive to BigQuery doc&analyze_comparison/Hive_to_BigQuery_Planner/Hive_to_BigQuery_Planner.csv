Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimation for Hive to BigQuery migration. Output 2 provides more detailed breakdown and structured presentation with 25 total hours vs Output 1's 45 hours. Key differences in effort estimation methodology and presentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs address identical migration planning goals with same cost calculations ($5.85 BigQuery runtime cost). Minor differences in effort estimation approach (Output 1: 45 hours total, Output 2: 25 hours with detailed breakdown). API costs differ slightly ($0.005 vs $0.0123)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Both follow similar three-section structure: Cost Estimation, Code Fixing/Testing Effort, API Cost. Output 2 provides more detailed subsection breakdown with tables and formatting. Output 1 uses simpler bullet-point structure while Output 2 uses structured headings and summary table."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_1,95,Lines 5-7,"Minor calculation inconsistency: states 500 GB for multiple tables but calculates as 50 GB (should be 0.05 TB for consistency). Otherwise syntactically correct documentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_2,98,All,"Highly structured and consistent documentation. Proper unit conversions (0.5 TB = 50 GB calculations corrected to 0.05 TB). Well-formatted tables and clear section headers. Minor formatting inconsistency with API cost presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,All,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper documentation structure and accurate calculations. Output 2 shows superior formatting and consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_1,80,Lines 10-15,"Consider adopting more detailed breakdown structure similar to Output 2. Verify unit conversion consistency in data volume calculations. Add structured summary table for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_to_BigQuery_Output_2,90,All,"Excellent structure and detail. Consider standardizing API cost format with other cost presentations. Minor recommendation to align effort estimation methodology with industry standards."
