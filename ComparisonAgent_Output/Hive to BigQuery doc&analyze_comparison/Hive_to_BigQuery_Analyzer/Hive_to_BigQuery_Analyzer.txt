# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both **Hive_SQL_Analysis** and **customer_purchase_query** outputs provide comprehensive analyses of Hive to BigQuery conversion processes. While both follow similar analytical frameworks covering script overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization techniques, they differ significantly in scope, detail level, and specific metrics. Hive_SQL_Analysis provides a more generalized assessment (70/100 complexity score) while customer_purchase_query offers deeper technical analysis with actual SQL code and higher complexity rating (85/100).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Hive to BigQuery conversion complexity and requirements. They share identical structural frameworks and similar analytical approaches covering:
- Script overview and business objectives
- Complexity metrics and technical specifications  
- Syntax differences between Hive and BigQuery
- Required manual adjustments and function mappings
- Conversion complexity assessment
- Optimization recommendations

However, **customer_purchase_query** provides significantly more technical depth with actual SQL code analysis (84 lines of code included), specific complexity breakdowns, and detailed function mappings. **Hive_SQL_Analysis** offers a more generalized assessment suitable for high-level planning. The semantic intent is highly aligned but execution depth varies substantially, with customer_purchase_query demonstrating superior technical rigor.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with matching section headers and logical flow:
1. Script Overview
2. Complexity Metrics  
3. Syntax Differences
4. Manual Adjustments
5. Conversion Complexity
6. Optimization Techniques
7. API Cost Estimation

The structural alignment is excellent with consistent use of bullet points, numbered sections, and hierarchical organization. Minor differences include **customer_purchase_query** having additional subsections for more granular analysis and **Hive_SQL_Analysis** using slightly different formatting conventions. Both maintain professional documentation standards with clear section delineation.

### Correctness

**Hive_SQL_Analysis (Score: 92/100)**: Syntax and formatting are generally correct with proper markdown structure and consistent terminology. Minor issues include inconsistent capitalization in some technical terms (lines 20-25) and one formatting inconsistency in the joins section where spacing varies. All technical references to Hive and BigQuery functions are accurate.

**customer_purchase_query (Score: 95/100)**: Excellent syntax correctness with proper SQL formatting, accurate function references, and consistent technical terminology. The included SQL code (lines 30-84) is syntactically valid Hive SQL with proper CTE structure, window functions, and join syntax. Minor deduction for one inconsistent bullet point formatting in the complexity metrics section.

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Hive_SQL_Analysis | customer_purchase_query | Overall |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Correctness | 92 | 95 | 94 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **86** | **86** |

## Recommendations

**For Hive_SQL_Analysis**: Enhance technical depth by including actual code examples and more specific complexity metrics. Consider providing more granular breakdowns of syntax differences and manual adjustments required. The generalized approach is good for overview but lacks implementation specifics that would be valuable for actual conversion projects.

**For customer_purchase_query**: Excellent technical depth and code inclusion provide superior practical value. Consider improving consistency in formatting and bullet point structure (lines 15-20). The detailed SQL analysis demonstrates best practices for conversion documentation. Minor improvements needed in section organization for better readability.

**Overall**: Both outputs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities with **customer_purchase_query** slightly ahead due to superior technical depth and code inclusion. The structural similarity indicates good standardization of analytical approaches across both agents.
