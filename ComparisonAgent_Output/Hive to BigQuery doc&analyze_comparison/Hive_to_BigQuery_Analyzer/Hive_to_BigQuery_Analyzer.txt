# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents produced comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analyses with identical structural organization but different technical findings. Agent 1 provided a more abstract analysis (120 lines, complexity 70/100, cost $0.005) while Agent 2 included actual SQL code and more detailed metrics (84 lines, complexity 85/100, cost $0.0123). Both recommend refactoring over rebuilding and identify similar optimization opportunities.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address identical conversion objectives with similar analytical frameworks. Key semantic differences include:
- Complexity scores: Agent 1 rates 70/100 vs Agent 2's 85/100
- Line counts: Agent 1 reports 120 lines vs Agent 2's 84 lines  
- API costs: Agent 1 estimates $0.005 vs Agent 2's $0.0123
- Level of technical detail: Agent 2 provides concrete SQL examples while Agent 1 remains more conceptual

Both reach similar conclusions about refactoring feasibility and identify comparable optimization strategies.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Nearly identical 7-section structure across both outputs:
1. Script Overview
2. Complexity Metrics
3. Syntax Differences  
4. Manual Adjustments
5. Conversion Complexity
6. Optimization Techniques
7. API Cost Estimation

Minor differences exist in subsection organization and bullet point formatting, but both follow the same logical analytical flow from overview to specific recommendations.

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 92/100)**: Well-formed documentation with consistent internal structure. Minor issues include some metrics lacking specific justification - the complexity score of 70/100 reasoning could be more detailed. All sections are properly formatted and cross-referenced.

**Agent 2 (Score: 96/100)**: Comprehensive documentation with actual SQL code validation. Includes concrete examples and detailed metric calculations. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points but demonstrates excellent technical accuracy and completeness.

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Correctness | 92 | 96 | 94 |
| **Overall** | **88** | **90** | **89** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1**: Enhance technical depth by providing concrete SQL examples and more detailed complexity score justifications. Consider including actual code snippets to support analysis claims.

**For Agent 2**: Standardize formatting consistency in bullet points and subsections. Consider providing more comparative analysis with alternative approaches to strengthen recommendations.
