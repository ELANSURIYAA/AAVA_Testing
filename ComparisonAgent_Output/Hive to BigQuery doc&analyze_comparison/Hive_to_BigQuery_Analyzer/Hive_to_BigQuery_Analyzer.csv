Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-120","Both agents provide comprehensive Hive-to-BigQuery conversion analyses with similar scope but different approaches. General_Analysis offers structured overview with moderate complexity assessment (70/100), while customer_purchase_query provides detailed implementation with higher complexity score (85/100) and includes actual SQL code. Both identify key conversion challenges including date functions, window functions, and syntax adjustments."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 vs Lines 1-84","Both outputs address identical core objective: analyzing Hive SQL to BigQuery conversion complexity. Both identify same key areas: syntax differences, manual adjustments, optimization techniques. Minor divergence in emphasis - General_Analysis focuses on theoretical framework while customer_purchase_query provides practical implementation details. Both conclude refactoring is preferred over rebuilding."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Section headers vs numbered sections","Both follow similar logical flow: overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, optimization. General_Analysis uses markdown headers and bullet points, customer_purchase_query uses numbered sections. customer_purchase_query includes additional SQL code section (lines 85-200+) not present in General_Analysis. Overall structure alignment is good despite formatting differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,General_Analysis,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Well-formed analysis with proper section structure. Minor issue: API cost format inconsistency ($0.005 vs typical decimal format). All technical details are syntactically correct and internally consistent. Table counts and join descriptions are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,customer_purchase_query,98,"Lines 85-200+","Excellent technical accuracy with complete SQL implementation. All Hive syntax elements properly identified. SQL code is syntactically valid Hive SQL with proper CTEs, joins, and window functions. Only minor formatting inconsistencies in numbered sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper analysis structure and valid technical content. customer_purchase_query slightly higher due to inclusion of working SQL code validation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,General_Analysis,,"Lines 1-10","Enhance with specific SQL code examples to demonstrate conversion challenges. Consider adding actual complexity scoring methodology details. Standardize API cost format for consistency."
Recommendations,Recommendation,customer_purchase_query,,"Lines 1-84","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider improving section formatting consistency. The inclusion of complete SQL code significantly enhances practical value. Minor improvement: add more detailed explanation of complexity scoring rationale."
