Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis reports with similar structural approach but differing in specific metrics and implementation details. Both outputs demonstrate strong analytical frameworks with semantic alignment score of 82/100, structural similarity of 95/100, and high correctness scores of 98/100 and 96/100 respectively."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-84","Both outputs address identical conversion analysis goals with similar analytical frameworks. Key semantic differences: Agent Output 1 reports 120 lines vs Agent Output 2's 84 lines (line 2 vs line 10), complexity scores differ (70/100 vs 85/100 at lines 25 vs 45), and API costs vary ($0.005 vs $0.0123 at final lines). Both cover same core topics but with different granularity and specific measurements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-84","Nearly identical 7-section structure: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Estimation. Minor structural differences in subsection organization and Agent Output 2 includes actual SQL code (lines 50-84) while Agent Output 1 focuses purely on analysis metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 1,98,"Lines 1-50","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting, proper section headers, accurate technical terminology, and coherent internal references. Minor issue: some metric values could benefit from more detailed justification (complexity score methodology at line 25)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent Output 2,96,"Lines 1-84","Comprehensive analysis with proper formatting and technical accuracy. Includes actual SQL code validation. Minor issues: slight inconsistency in join count reporting (line 11 mentions '7 total' but breakdown doesn't clearly sum to 7) and some redundant phrasing in syntax differences section (lines 20-25)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure, accurate technical terminology, and consistent formatting. Average of individual scores reflects strong overall quality with minor areas for improvement."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 1,,Lines 25-30,"Enhance complexity scoring methodology transparency by providing detailed breakdown of how the 70/100 score was calculated. Consider adding more specific examples of syntax transformations needed."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent Output 2,,Lines 10-15,"Clarify join count discrepancies in complexity metrics section. The reported '7 total joins' should have a clear breakdown that sums correctly. Consider condensing redundant syntax difference explanations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized metrics reporting format and consistent granularity levels. Consider establishing common templates for conversion analysis to improve comparability across different SQL migration projects."
