Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-120 vs 1-84","Both outputs provide comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analyses with similar structural approaches but notable differences in depth and implementation details. Agent_1 offers a more concise overview focusing on high-level metrics and conversion strategies, while Agent_2 provides detailed SQL code analysis with specific line-by-line complexity assessment. Both achieve the core objective of analyzing conversion complexity and providing actionable migration guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-40","Both outputs address the same core objective of Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis. They share similar analytical frameworks covering complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. However, Agent_2 provides more granular detail with actual SQL code analysis (lines 45-84) while Agent_1 focuses on higher-level strategic guidance. The semantic intent aligns well but with different levels of technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-120 vs 1-84","Both outputs follow nearly identical 7-section structures: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Estimation. Agent_2 includes additional SQL code content (lines 45-84) that Agent_1 lacks. The logical flow and decomposition approach are highly similar, but Agent_2 provides more detailed subsection breakdowns within each major section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Agent_1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with well-structured analysis sections. Minor issues include: inconsistent complexity scoring methodology (line 45: '70/100' without clear criteria), and some generalized statements about function mappings that could be more specific. All technical references to Hive and BigQuery features are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 20-30, 50-60, 70-84","Agent_2 shows good overall correctness but has some inconsistencies: complexity score of '85/100' (line 50) uses different criteria than Agent_1, some redundant information in CTE descriptions (lines 20-30), and the included SQL code has proper Hive syntax but contains some potential optimization issues in the GROUP BY clauses (lines 70-84)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores","Both outputs maintain high correctness standards with proper technical terminology and accurate feature mappings between Hive and BigQuery."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 60-80","Strengthen the analysis by providing more specific examples of syntax conversions and include actual code snippets to support theoretical guidance. Consider adding more detailed cost estimation methodology."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 45-84","Improve consistency in complexity scoring methodology and reduce redundancy in technical descriptions. The included SQL code is valuable but could benefit from inline comments explaining BigQuery-specific optimizations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs would benefit from standardized complexity scoring criteria and more detailed cost-benefit analysis for different migration approaches. Consider adding timeline estimates for conversion activities."
