Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Two comprehensive Hive-to-BigQuery conversion analyses with different approaches: Agent_1_Output provides a structured 7-section analysis with moderate complexity scoring (70/100), while customer_purchase_query provides more detailed metrics with higher complexity scoring (85/100) and includes the actual SQL script. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding but differ significantly in depth and methodology."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,All lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Hive-to-BigQuery conversion complexity. They share similar intent in evaluating syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. However, customer_purchase_query provides more granular analysis with specific function mappings and includes actual SQL script examination, while Agent_1_Output focuses on higher-level categorization. The semantic alignment is strong but with notable differences in analytical depth and specificity."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,Lines 1-50 vs 1-100,"Both outputs follow similar structural patterns with numbered sections covering overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization techniques. However, customer_purchase_query includes additional elements like complete SQL script analysis (lines 51-100) and more detailed subsection breakdowns. Agent_1_Output uses a more concise 7-section approach while customer_purchase_query employs expanded analysis with embedded code examination. The core flow is similar but implementation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,92,Lines 15-20 and 35-40,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with well-structured sections and consistent formatting. Minor issues include: incomplete complexity scoring justification (line 18) and some generalized statements without specific examples (lines 35-40). All technical references are accurate and internal consistency is maintained throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,customer_purchase_query,88,Lines 25-30 and 85-90,"customer_purchase_query shows good overall correctness with comprehensive SQL script inclusion. Issues identified: some inconsistent formatting in complexity metrics section (lines 25-30) and minor syntax variations in the embedded SQL comments (lines 85-90). The technical content is accurate but presentation could be more standardized."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with accurate technical content and consistent internal structure. Average correctness score reflects strong technical accuracy with minor presentation and formatting variations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,Lines 1-50,"Enhance analysis depth by including specific code examples and more granular complexity breakdowns. Consider adding actual SQL script examination to support theoretical analysis. Expand on optimization techniques with concrete implementation examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,customer_purchase_query,,Lines 1-100,"Improve structural consistency and formatting standardization across all sections. Consider consolidating the extensive SQL analysis into more digestible summary points. Enhance the complexity scoring methodology with clearer justification criteria."
