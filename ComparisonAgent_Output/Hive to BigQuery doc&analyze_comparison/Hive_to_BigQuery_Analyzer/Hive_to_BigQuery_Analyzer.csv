Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-120 (Agent 1) vs Lines 1-84+ (Agent 2),"Both outputs provide comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis. Agent 1 delivers a structured analytical framework covering script overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, optimization techniques, and cost estimation. Agent 2 provides similar analysis but includes the complete source Hive SQL script for practical reference. Both address the same core objective of analyzing conversion feasibility and requirements, with Agent 2 providing more concrete examples through the actual SQL code. The outputs complement each other well - Agent 1 focuses on systematic analysis methodology while Agent 2 demonstrates practical application."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-30 (both agents)","Both outputs address Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis with strong semantic alignment. Agent 1 provides systematic framework analysis covering business objectives (customer behavior analysis, targeted marketing, revenue optimization) while Agent 2 focuses on the same customer purchase pattern analysis with concrete SQL implementation. Both identify identical core challenges: date function conversions, window function syntax, partitioning differences, and data type mappings. Agent 2's inclusion of the actual SQL script (lines 85+) provides practical validation of Agent 1's theoretical analysis. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on methodology while Agent 2 emphasizes implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1) vs Lines 1-84 (Agent 2)","Both outputs follow similar analytical structure with sections for overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-7) with clear hierarchical organization. Agent 2 uses similar structure but with different formatting and includes session identifier. Key structural differences: Agent 1 provides more detailed subsections within each category, Agent 2 integrates the complete SQL script as supporting evidence. Both use consistent logical flow from high-level overview to detailed technical analysis to cost estimation. Agent 2's inclusion of the full SQL script (lines 85-168) adds practical dimension absent in Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-structured analytical framework. Minor issues: some function name inconsistencies in syntax difference descriptions (line 22 mentions DATEDIFF() vs DATE_DIFF() but formatting could be clearer). All section references are internally consistent, complexity scoring methodology is sound, and technical recommendations are accurate. Cost estimation format is properly structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,92,"Lines 30-40, 85-168","Agent 2 shows strong correctness with accurate technical analysis and valid Hive SQL syntax in the included script. Minor issues: some inconsistency in join count reporting (line 15 reports '7 total joins' but breakdown doesn't clearly sum to 7). The SQL script itself (lines 85-168) is syntactically correct Hive SQL with proper CTE structure, valid window functions, and correct GROUP BY clauses. All function references and technical details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with minor formatting and counting inconsistencies that don't affect core analysis quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,N/A,"Lines 1-120","Agent 1 provides excellent systematic framework for Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis. Recommend enhancing with concrete SQL examples to validate theoretical analysis. The structured approach with numbered sections and detailed complexity scoring is highly valuable for standardized conversion assessments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,N/A,"Lines 1-168","Agent 2 effectively combines analysis with practical SQL implementation. Recommend improving consistency in metrics reporting (join counts, aggregate function counts) and standardizing section formatting. The inclusion of complete SQL script significantly enhances practical value and should be maintained in future analyses."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"All lines","Both outputs would benefit from cross-validation - Agent 1's systematic methodology could validate Agent 2's SQL implementation, while Agent 2's concrete examples could enhance Agent 1's theoretical framework. Consider combining approaches: structured analytical framework with embedded SQL examples and consistent metrics reporting."
