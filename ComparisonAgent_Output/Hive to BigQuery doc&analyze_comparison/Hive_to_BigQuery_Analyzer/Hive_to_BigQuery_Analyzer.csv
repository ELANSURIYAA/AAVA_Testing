Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-84","Both agents produced comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analyses with identical structural organization but different technical findings. Agent 1 provided a more abstract analysis (120 lines, complexity 70/100, cost $0.005) while Agent 2 included actual SQL code and more detailed metrics (84 lines, complexity 85/100, cost $0.0123). Both recommend refactoring over rebuilding and identify similar optimization opportunities."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 1-84","Both outputs address identical conversion objectives with similar analytical frameworks. Key semantic differences: complexity scores (70 vs 85), line counts (120 vs 84), API costs ($0.005 vs $0.0123), and level of technical detail. Agent 2 provides concrete SQL examples while Agent 1 remains more conceptual. Both reach similar conclusions about refactoring feasibility."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-84","Nearly identical 7-section structure: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Estimation. Minor differences in subsection organization and bullet point formatting. Both follow logical analytical flow from overview to specific recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 1-84","Well-formed documentation with consistent internal structure. Minor issues: some metrics lack specific justification (complexity score 70/100 reasoning could be more detailed). All sections properly formatted and cross-referenced."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,"Lines 1-84","Comprehensive documentation with actual SQL code validation. Includes concrete examples and detailed metric calculations. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet points but overall excellent technical accuracy and completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores (92 + 96)/2 = 94. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper documentation structure."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 1-84","Enhance technical depth by providing concrete SQL examples and more detailed complexity score justifications. Consider including actual code snippets to support analysis claims."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 1-84","Standardize formatting consistency in bullet points and subsections. Consider providing more comparative analysis with alternative approaches to strengthen recommendations."
