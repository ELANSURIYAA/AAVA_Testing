Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-120 vs 1-84","Both agents provide comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis with similar 7-section structure. Agent 1 offers more detailed complexity metrics (120 lines vs 84 lines) while Agent 2 provides more specific join counts and table analysis. Both identify key conversion challenges including date function replacements, window function syntax adjustments, and partitioning strategy changes. Semantic alignment is strong (85/100) with both addressing identical conversion requirements. Structural similarity is excellent (92/100) following nearly identical organizational patterns. Overall correctness is high (92/100) with Agent 1 showing superior consistency in metrics reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-10, Lines 45-60 vs 40-55","Both outputs address Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis with strong semantic alignment. Core conversion challenges are consistently identified: date function replacements (DATEDIFF to DATE_DIFF), window function syntax adjustments, and partitioning strategy changes. Agent 1 provides more comprehensive business context mentioning customer retention and revenue optimization, while Agent 2 focuses more on technical migration aspects. Both correctly identify complexity scores in 70-85 range and similar optimization strategies. Minor divergence in emphasis on specific technical details vs business applications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-120 vs 1-84","Excellent structural alignment with both following identical 7-section organization: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, API Cost Estimation. Section ordering and logical flow are nearly identical. Minor differences in subsection organization within Complexity Metrics (Agent 1 uses bullet points, Agent 2 uses dashes) and slight variation in optimization technique categorization. Both maintain consistent hierarchical structure with clear section delineation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,"Lines 16-25, Lines 70-85","High syntactic correctness with consistent metric reporting. All numerical values are properly formatted and internally consistent. Table counts, join counts, and function usage statistics align logically. Complexity score of 70/100 is well-justified with supporting rationale. Date function mappings are accurate (DATEDIFF to DATE_DIFF, QUARTER to EXTRACT). API cost format is consistent at $0.005. Minor formatting inconsistencies in bullet point usage but no syntactic errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,"Lines 20-30, Lines 55-65","Generally correct with some internal inconsistencies. Join count reporting shows discrepancy (states 7 total joins but breakdown doesn't sum correctly). Complexity score of 85/100 is higher than Agent 1 but less well-justified in supporting text. Date function mappings are accurate. Some redundancy in conditional logic counting (7+ vs specific counts). API cost precision differs significantly (0.0123 vs 0.005). Table analysis is more detailed but contains minor inconsistencies in aggregation function counts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual agent scores (95+88)/2=91.5, rounded to 92. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting and valid technical content. Agent 1 shows superior internal consistency while Agent 2 provides more detailed technical analysis despite minor inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,"Lines 70-85","Maintain current level of metric consistency and business context integration. Consider adding more detailed join analysis similar to Agent 2. Expand on specific BigQuery optimization techniques beyond basic partitioning suggestions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,"Lines 20-30, Lines 55-65","Improve internal consistency in numerical reporting, particularly join counts and aggregation function tallies. Align complexity scoring rationale with stated score. Standardize conditional logic counting methodology. Consider adding business context similar to Agent 1's approach."
