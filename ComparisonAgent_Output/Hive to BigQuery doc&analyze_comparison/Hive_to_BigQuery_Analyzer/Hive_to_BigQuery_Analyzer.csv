Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive Hive to BigQuery conversion analysis with similar structural approaches. Agent_1_Output delivers a concise 7-section framework covering essential conversion aspects with moderate complexity assessment (70/100). Agent_2_Output provides more granular analysis with higher complexity scoring (85/100) and includes complete SQL code for validation. Key differences include complexity scoring methodology, metric precision, and code inclusion. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with complementary strengths."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,Lines 1-50 vs 1-120,"Both outputs address identical conversion goals with aligned business objectives and technical scope. Agent_1_Output focuses on systematic conversion methodology while Agent_2_Output emphasizes detailed metrics and code analysis. Core semantic alignment includes: conversion complexity assessment, syntax difference identification, optimization recommendations, and cost estimation. Minor divergence in complexity scoring approach (70 vs 85) reflects different evaluation criteria rather than fundamental disagreement."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50 vs 1-120,"Exceptional structural alignment with identical 7-section framework: Script Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Conversion Complexity, Optimization Techniques, and API Cost Estimation. Both follow logical progression from analysis to implementation recommendations. Agent_2_Output includes additional SQL code section (lines 60-120) providing concrete validation material. Section ordering, subsection organization, and analytical flow demonstrate near-identical structural thinking."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 15-25,"High syntactic correctness with minor issues: Missing specific line count validation against actual code, generalized complexity metrics without granular breakdown. All technical recommendations are syntactically sound and implementation-ready. Hive-to-BigQuery function mappings are accurate (DATEDIFF→DATE_DIFF, QUARTER→EXTRACT). Cost estimation format is valid."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,98,Lines 60-120,"Excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive SQL code validation. All Hive syntax elements properly identified and mapped to BigQuery equivalents. Window functions, CTEs, and join structures are accurately analyzed. Minor deduction for potential GROUP BY clause analysis depth. Complete code inclusion enables full validation of conversion recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5 rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with Agent_2_Output providing superior validation through complete code inclusion."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 35-45,"Enhance complexity assessment with granular metrics breakdown. Include actual code samples for validation. Expand cost estimation methodology with detailed calculation rationale."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 45-55,"Strengthen GROUP BY clause analysis depth. Consider adding performance impact assessment for complex window functions. Expand optimization recommendations with specific BigQuery best practices."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology, 2) Cross-validation of technical recommendations, 3) Enhanced cost estimation with multiple scenario analysis, 4) Integration of BigQuery-specific optimization patterns beyond basic syntax conversion."
