Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All lines,"Both Hive_SQL_Analysis and customer_purchase_query outputs provide comprehensive analyses of Hive to BigQuery conversion processes. While both follow similar analytical frameworks covering script overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, conversion complexity, and optimization techniques, they differ significantly in scope, detail level, and specific metrics. Hive_SQL_Analysis provides a more generalized assessment (70/100 complexity score) while customer_purchase_query offers deeper technical analysis with actual SQL code and higher complexity rating (85/100)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-50 vs 1-84,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing Hive to BigQuery conversion complexity and requirements. They share identical structural frameworks (overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, optimization techniques) and similar analytical approaches. However, customer_purchase_query provides significantly more technical depth with actual SQL code analysis, specific line counts (84 vs 120), and more detailed complexity breakdowns. The semantic intent is highly aligned but execution depth varies substantially."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,Lines 1-50 vs 1-84,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization with matching section headers and logical flow: 1) Script Overview, 2) Complexity Metrics, 3) Syntax Differences, 4) Manual Adjustments, 5) Conversion Complexity, 6) Optimization Techniques, 7) API Cost Estimation. The structural alignment is excellent with consistent use of bullet points, numbered sections, and hierarchical organization. Minor differences include customer_purchase_query having additional subsections and more granular breakdowns within each section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_SQL_Analysis,92,Lines 15-25,"Syntax and formatting are generally correct with proper markdown structure and consistent terminology. Minor issues include inconsistent capitalization in some technical terms and one formatting inconsistency in the joins section where spacing varies. All technical references to Hive and BigQuery functions are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,customer_purchase_query,95,Lines 30-84,"Excellent syntax correctness with proper SQL formatting, accurate function references, and consistent technical terminology. The included SQL code is syntactically valid Hive SQL with proper CTE structure, window functions, and join syntax. Minor deduction for one inconsistent bullet point formatting in the complexity metrics section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores (92 + 95)/2 = 93.5, rounded to 94. Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with minimal syntax or formatting issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_SQL_Analysis,N/A,Lines 35-45,"Enhance technical depth by including actual code examples and more specific complexity metrics. Consider providing more granular breakdowns of syntax differences and manual adjustments required. The generalized approach is good for overview but lacks implementation specifics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,customer_purchase_query,N/A,Lines 50-84,"Excellent technical depth and code inclusion. Consider improving consistency in formatting and bullet point structure. The detailed SQL analysis provides superior practical value for actual conversion projects. Minor improvements needed in section organization for better readability."
