# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation of Hive SQL customer behavior analysis scripts. Agent_2_Output demonstrates superior depth with 84 lines vs 120 lines claimed by Agent_1_Output, more detailed data mapping (25+ mappings vs 4), and higher technical complexity (85/100 vs 75/100). Both outputs follow similar 10-section structures covering program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Agent_2_Output provides more granular technical details including specific function usage, comprehensive data mapping tables, and more precise complexity metrics.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing customer purchasing behaviors using Hive SQL for enterprise data warehousing. Core semantic elements align strongly - customer segmentation, RFM scoring, seasonal analysis, and product category preferences. Minor semantic divergence in technical depth and implementation details. Agent_2_Output provides more comprehensive business context and detailed analytical framework.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both outputs follow nearly identical 10-section documentation structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Agent_2_Output includes additional subsections and more detailed breakdowns within each section, but maintains the same overall architectural approach.

### Correctness

**Agent_1_Output (Score: 85/100)**
Generally well-formed documentation with consistent internal references. Minor issues at lines 45-48 where the data mapping table has only 4 entries vs comprehensive analysis claimed. Complexity metrics appear simplified. Technical details are accurate but lack depth in some areas.

**Agent_2_Output (Score: 95/100)**
Highly detailed and internally consistent documentation. Comprehensive 25+ row data mapping table (lines 82-125) with precise source-target relationships. Technical complexity analysis is thorough and well-justified. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some table structures.

**Overall Correctness: 90/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1_Output | Agent_2_Output | Overall |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Correctness | 85 | 95 | 90 |
| **Overall** | **88** | **92** | **90** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1_Output:**
- Expand data mapping section (lines 45-48) to include comprehensive source-target relationships
- Enhance complexity analysis with more granular metrics
- Add specific technical implementation details for CTEs and window functions

**For Agent_2_Output:**
- Maintain current level of technical depth and comprehensive coverage
- Consider standardizing table formatting for consistency (lines 1-10)
- Excellent model for technical documentation standards

**Overall:**
Both outputs provide valuable Hive SQL analysis documentation. Agent_2_Output serves as the superior reference due to comprehensive data mapping, detailed complexity analysis, and thorough technical coverage. Consider using Agent_2_Output structure as template for future documentation projects.
