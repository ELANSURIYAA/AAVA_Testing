Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both Agent_1 and Agent_2 outputs provide comprehensive 10-section analyses of Hive SQL customer behavior analytics scripts. They demonstrate strong semantic alignment (85/100) with identical business objectives and technical scope, excellent structural similarity (95/100) following the same organizational framework, and high correctness (Agent_1: 92/100, Agent_2: 88/100, Overall: 90/100). Key differences include Agent_2's more detailed technical specifications, explicit complexity scoring, and enhanced data mapping tables, while Agent_1 provides more concise business-focused summaries."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All Sections,"Both outputs address identical business objectives - analyzing customer purchasing behavior through Hive SQL for enterprise data warehousing. They share the same core analytical components (CTEs, customer segmentation, RFM scoring, seasonal analysis) and business benefits (targeted marketing, customer retention, revenue optimization). However, Agent_2 provides more granular technical details including specific function usage (ROW_NUMBER, NTILE, DATEDIFF), explicit complexity scoring (85/100), and detailed performance optimization strategies. Agent_1 focuses more on high-level business alignment and strategic value propositions. The semantic intent and analytical approach are fundamentally aligned with differences primarily in technical depth and presentation style."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,Section Headers 1-10,"Both outputs follow identical 10-section organizational structures with matching headers: 1. Overview of Program, 2. Code Structure and Design, 3. Data Flow and Processing Logic, 4. Data Mapping, 5. Performance Optimization Strategies, 6. Technical Elements and Best Practices, 7. Complexity Analysis, 8. Assumptions and Dependencies, 9. Key Outputs, 10. Error Handling and Logging. Within each section, both use consistent formatting approaches including bullet points, sub-bullets, tables, and hierarchical organization. The logical flow and information architecture are nearly identical, with only minor variations in sub-section emphasis and content depth."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,Lines 15-20 45-50,"Agent_1 output demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and well-structured tables. Minor issues include: (1) Lines 15-20 - some bullet point formatting inconsistencies in the overview section, (2) Lines 45-50 - data mapping table could benefit from more complete source-to-target mappings. Internal references are consistent, no broken links or formatting errors detected. The complexity analysis table (lines 85-95) is well-formatted and complete."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,Lines 25-30 65-70 120-125,"Agent_2 output shows good overall correctness with comprehensive technical details and proper formatting. Issues identified: (1) Lines 25-30 - minor inconsistency in bullet point indentation within code structure section, (2) Lines 65-70 - data mapping table has some formatting irregularities in the remarks column, (3) Lines 120-125 - complexity analysis section includes subjective scoring that could be more objectively justified. The technical content is accurate and well-referenced, with extensive use of proper HiveQL terminology and concepts."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy, proper formatting, and comprehensive coverage of required analysis dimensions. The outputs are internally consistent with appropriate use of technical terminology and structured presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,Sections 4-5,"Enhance data mapping section with more comprehensive source-to-target field mappings and transformation logic details. Consider adding explicit performance benchmarks and optimization metrics to strengthen the technical analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,Sections 6-7,"Improve formatting consistency in data mapping tables and provide more objective justification for complexity scoring metrics. Consider adding business impact quantification to complement the detailed technical analysis."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Sections,"Both outputs would benefit from: (1) Including actual code snippets or pseudocode examples, (2) Adding quantitative performance metrics and benchmarks, (3) Providing more specific recommendations for optimization implementation, (4) Including risk assessment and mitigation strategies for identified dependencies and assumptions."
