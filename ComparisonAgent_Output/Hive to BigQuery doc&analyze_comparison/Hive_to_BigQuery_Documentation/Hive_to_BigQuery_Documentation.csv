Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-120,"Both agents provide comprehensive documentation analysis of Hive SQL code for customer purchasing behavior analysis. Agent_1 delivers a structured 10-section analysis covering program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity metrics. Agent_2 provides more detailed technical analysis with extensive data mapping tables, enhanced complexity scoring, and deeper technical insights. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of enterprise data warehousing principles and Hive SQL analytics."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-120,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing Hive SQL code for customer purchasing behavior analytics. They share the same fundamental understanding of the business problem (customer segmentation, targeted marketing, revenue optimization) and technical approach (CTEs, window functions, aggregations). Minor semantic differences include Agent_2's more detailed RFM scoring explanation and enhanced seasonal analysis depth. Both correctly identify the enterprise data warehousing alignment and business benefits."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,85,1-120,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with program overview, code analysis, data flow, and complexity assessment sections. Agent_1 uses a clean 10-section format while Agent_2 employs the same 10 sections but with more granular subsections and detailed tables. Key structural differences: Agent_2 includes more comprehensive data mapping tables (lines 45-65), enhanced complexity metrics table (lines 75-85), and deeper technical element analysis. Both use logical progression from overview to technical details to complexity analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-120,"Agent_1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with well-structured sections, consistent formatting, and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues: complexity score of 75 may be conservative given the advanced analytics described (line 95), and some performance optimization details could be more specific (lines 85-90). All section references are consistent and technical descriptions are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,1-120,"Agent_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive data mapping tables, detailed complexity analysis, and accurate technical specifications. Very minor formatting inconsistencies in table alignment (lines 50-60) and one instance of redundant phrasing in performance section (line 88). The complexity score of 85 is well-justified and supported by detailed metrics. All technical references and calculations are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores (95+98)/2 = 96.5, rounded to 97. Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic accuracy with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and well-structured content."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,85-95,"Consider expanding the complexity analysis section with more detailed metrics similar to Agent_2's approach. Add more specific performance optimization examples and enhance the data mapping section with comprehensive field-level mappings. The overall analysis is solid but could benefit from deeper technical granularity."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,75-85,"Excellent comprehensive analysis. Minor suggestions include streamlining some redundant explanations in the performance section and ensuring consistent table formatting throughout. The detailed approach provides superior technical depth and should be maintained as the standard for future documentation analysis tasks."
