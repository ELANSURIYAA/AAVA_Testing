Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-120 vs 1-200+,"Two comprehensive documentation reports analyzing Hive SQL customer behavior analysis code. First output provides structured 10-section analysis with complexity scoring table. Second output offers more detailed technical analysis with extensive data mapping and performance optimization strategies. Both address same business problem but differ significantly in depth and presentation approach."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Sections 1-3 vs 1-3","Both outputs address identical business problem of customer purchasing behavior analysis using Hive SQL. Both identify same core purpose (customer segmentation, analytics, targeted marketing) and business benefits. Key semantic alignment includes: enterprise data warehousing context, customer lifetime value analysis, RFM scoring, seasonal patterns. Divergence in emphasis: first output focuses on high-level overview while second provides granular technical details. Both correctly identify HiveQL components, CTEs, and analytical functions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Overall structure comparison","Both follow systematic documentation approach but with different organizational frameworks. First output uses consistent 10-section structure (Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance, Technical Elements, Complexity, Assumptions, Outputs, Error Handling). Second output uses similar sections but with more granular subsections and extensive tabular data. Structural differences: first uses complexity scoring table, second provides detailed data mapping table. Both use numbered sections but second has more nested subsections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Output,92,"Lines 15-25, 45-50","Well-structured documentation with consistent formatting. Minor issues: some generic statements without specific line references to actual code (lines 15-25). Complexity analysis table properly formatted but some metrics appear estimated rather than calculated (lines 45-50). Technical terminology used correctly throughout. No syntax errors in documentation structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Output,88,"Lines 80-90, 150-160","Comprehensive and technically accurate documentation. Minor inconsistencies in data mapping table formatting (lines 80-90). Some assumptions about data types and schema without explicit validation (lines 150-160). Excellent use of technical terminology and detailed explanations. Well-structured tables and consistent formatting throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with proper technical terminology, consistent formatting, and accurate business context. Average of individual scores reflects minor formatting and assumption issues in both documents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,First_Output,,"Lines 30-40","Enhance data mapping section with more detailed field-level transformations. Add specific code line references when discussing technical components. Include more granular performance optimization recommendations beyond general suggestions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Second_Output,,"Lines 100-120","Standardize table formatting across all sections for consistency. Validate data type assumptions with actual schema definitions. Consider condensing some overly detailed sections while maintaining technical accuracy."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Overall comparison","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized section numbering and formatting, 2) Consistent level of technical detail across all sections, 3) More specific references to actual code elements, 4) Integration of complexity analysis with performance recommendations, 5) Clearer distinction between assumptions and validated facts."
