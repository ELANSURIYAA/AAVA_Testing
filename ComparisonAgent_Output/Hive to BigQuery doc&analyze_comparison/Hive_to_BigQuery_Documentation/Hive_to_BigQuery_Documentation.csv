Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-120 (Agent_1) and Lines 1-200+ (Agent_2),"Both agents produced comprehensive Hive SQL analysis documentation covering customer purchasing behavior analytics. Agent_1 provided a structured 10-section analysis with 120 lines covering program overview, code structure, data flow, and performance considerations. Agent_2 delivered a more detailed 200+ line analysis with enhanced technical depth, more comprehensive data mapping tables, and detailed complexity metrics. Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of enterprise data warehousing principles and Hive SQL analytics. Semantic alignment is excellent (95/100) with both addressing identical business problems and technical requirements. Structural similarity is high (88/100) with consistent section organization but varying levels of detail. Correctness scores show Agent_2 (96/100) slightly outperforming Agent_1 (92/100) due to more precise technical specifications and comprehensive coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-15 (both agents), Lines 45-60 (both agents)","Both outputs demonstrate excellent semantic alignment in addressing customer purchasing behavior analysis using Hive SQL. Core business problems, analytical objectives, and enterprise data warehousing principles are consistently addressed. Agent_1 focuses on 'customer behaviors for targeted marketing, customer retention, and revenue optimization' while Agent_2 emphasizes 'customer value, preferences, and trends, enabling data-driven decisions.' Both identify identical technical components (CTEs, window functions, aggregations) and business benefits. Minor semantic differences exist in emphasis: Agent_1 highlights 'strategic decision-making' while Agent_2 focuses on 'actionable business intelligence.' Overall intent and meaning are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Section headers (both agents), Lines 25-40 (Agent_1), Lines 30-50 (Agent_2)","Both outputs follow identical 10-section structural organization: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. Agent_1 uses bullet-point formatting with concise subsections, while Agent_2 employs more detailed subsections with enhanced technical depth. Structural differences include: Agent_2 provides more comprehensive data mapping tables (25+ rows vs 4 rows), detailed complexity analysis table with specific metrics, and enhanced technical specifications. Both maintain logical flow and consistent section progression, but Agent_2 offers more granular structural decomposition."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 85-95 (complexity table), Lines 110-120 (assumptions section)","Agent_1 demonstrates strong technical accuracy with well-structured content and consistent formatting. Minor issues include: simplified complexity analysis table lacking specific quantitative metrics, some generalized technical specifications without detailed implementation guidance, and abbreviated data mapping section. Technical terminology is accurate, section organization is logical, and content flows coherently. Performance optimization strategies are correctly identified but could benefit from more specific implementation details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,"Lines 150-180 (data mapping table), Lines 200-220 (complexity analysis)","Agent_2 exhibits excellent technical precision with comprehensive coverage and detailed specifications. Strengths include: extensive data mapping table with precise source-to-target relationships, quantitative complexity analysis with specific metrics (84 lines, 6 tables, 7 joins), detailed technical element specifications, and comprehensive performance optimization strategies. Minor areas for improvement include potential over-specification in some sections and slight redundancy in technical descriptions. Overall technical accuracy and completeness are exceptional."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Combined correctness assessment shows both outputs maintain high technical standards with Agent_2 providing slightly more comprehensive and precise technical documentation. Both demonstrate solid understanding of Hive SQL analytics, enterprise data warehousing principles, and business intelligence requirements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 25-30 (code structure), Lines 85-95 (complexity analysis),"Enhance technical depth by providing more detailed complexity metrics, expand data mapping section with comprehensive source-to-target relationships, and include specific quantitative measures for performance optimization strategies. Consider adding more granular subsections for improved structural organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 150-180 (data mapping), Lines 200-220 (technical elements),"Maintain current level of technical comprehensiveness while streamlining some over-specified sections to improve readability. Consider consolidating redundant technical descriptions and ensuring consistent formatting across all tabular data presentations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,Overall document structure and content quality,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent understanding of Hive SQL analytics and enterprise data warehousing. Future iterations should focus on balancing comprehensive technical detail with concise presentation, ensuring consistent formatting standards, and providing specific implementation guidance for optimization strategies."
