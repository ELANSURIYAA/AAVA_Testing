Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All sections,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Hive SQL code for customer purchasing behavior analysis. Agent_1 presents a structured 10-section format with complexity scoring and detailed technical analysis. Agent_2 follows similar structure but with more granular data mapping and enhanced technical depth. Both address enterprise data warehousing principles and business value proposition effectively."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-120 (Agent_1), Lines 1-84 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address identical business problem: customer purchasing behavior analysis using Hive SQL. Core semantic intent is aligned - analyzing customer segmentation, RFM scoring, seasonal patterns, and product preferences. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on complexity scoring (line 120), while Agent_2 provides more detailed data mapping (lines 45-75). Both correctly identify enterprise data warehousing alignment and business benefits."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Section headers 1-10 (both agents)","Both outputs follow nearly identical 10-section structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Agent_1 uses bullet points and tables consistently. Agent_2 uses similar formatting with enhanced subsection organization. Minor structural differences in data mapping presentation - Agent_1 uses simple table (line 45), Agent_2 uses comprehensive mapping table (lines 45-75)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 85-95, 105-115","Agent_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness. Minor issues: complexity score table formatting could be improved (line 95), some technical details lack specificity in performance optimization section (lines 105-115). All references to Hive components, SQL syntax, and technical architecture are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,"Lines 20-30, 45-75","Agent_2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive data mapping table properly formatted (lines 45-75). Technical details are more specific and accurate. Minor issue: some line count discrepancies in complexity analysis (line 20 states 84 lines vs actual content). All SQL syntax references and technical components are correctly described."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with proper SQL syntax references, correct Hive component identification, and valid architectural descriptions. Agent_2 slightly superior in technical precision and data mapping completeness."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 105-115","Enhance performance optimization section with more specific technical details and concrete examples. Consider adding more granular complexity metrics beyond the summary table."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 20, 84","Verify line count accuracy in complexity analysis section. Consider adding complexity scoring methodology similar to Agent_1 for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All sections","Both outputs are high-quality documentation. Consider standardizing data mapping table format and adding more specific performance tuning examples. Both could benefit from including actual SQL code snippets for better technical illustration."
