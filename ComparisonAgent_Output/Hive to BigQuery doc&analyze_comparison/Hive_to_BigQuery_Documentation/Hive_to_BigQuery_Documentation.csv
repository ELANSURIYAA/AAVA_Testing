Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide comprehensive documentation of Hive SQL customer behavior analysis scripts. Agent_2_Output demonstrates superior depth with 84 lines vs 120 lines claimed by Agent_1_Output, more detailed data mapping (25+ mappings vs 4), and higher technical complexity (85/100 vs 75/100). Both outputs follow similar 10-section structures covering program overview, code structure, data flow, performance optimization, and complexity analysis. Agent_2_Output provides more granular technical details including specific function usage, comprehensive data mapping tables, and more precise complexity metrics."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: analyzing customer purchasing behaviors using Hive SQL for enterprise data warehousing. Core semantic elements align strongly - customer segmentation, RFM scoring, seasonal analysis, and product category preferences. Minor semantic divergence in technical depth and implementation details. Agent_2_Output provides more comprehensive business context and detailed analytical framework."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 10-section documentation structure: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance Optimization, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Agent_2_Output includes additional subsections and more detailed breakdowns within each section, but maintains the same overall architectural approach."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,85,Lines 45-48,"Generally well-formed documentation with consistent internal references. Minor issues: Line 45-48 data mapping table has only 4 entries vs comprehensive analysis claimed. Complexity metrics appear simplified. Technical details are accurate but lack depth in some areas."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,95,Lines 82-125,"Highly detailed and internally consistent documentation. Comprehensive 25+ row data mapping table (lines 82-125) with precise source-target relationships. Technical complexity analysis is thorough and well-justified. Minor formatting inconsistencies in some table structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,N/A,"Average correctness score of 90/100. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical accuracy with Agent_2_Output showing superior internal consistency and comprehensive detail coverage."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 45-48,"Expand data mapping section to include comprehensive source-target relationships. Enhance complexity analysis with more granular metrics. Add specific technical implementation details for CTEs and window functions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Lines 1-10,"Maintain current level of technical depth and comprehensive coverage. Consider standardizing table formatting for consistency. Excellent model for technical documentation standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide valuable Hive SQL analysis documentation. Agent_2_Output serves as the superior reference due to comprehensive data mapping, detailed complexity analysis, and thorough technical coverage. Consider using Agent_2_Output structure as template for future documentation projects."
