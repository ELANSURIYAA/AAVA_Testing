Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All,"Two comprehensive Hive SQL documentation outputs analyzed for customer purchasing behavior analytics. Agent_1_Overview provides structured analysis across 10 sections with 120-line complexity assessment. Agent_2_Comprehensive delivers detailed 84-line analysis with extensive data mapping tables and technical depth. Both outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (92/100) addressing identical business problems and technical components. Structural similarity is excellent (88/100) with matching 10-section frameworks and logical flow. Correctness scores are high (Agent_1_Overview: 94/100, Agent_2_Comprehensive: 96/100, Overall: 95/100) with well-formed technical content and consistent internal references."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,All,"Both outputs analyze identical Hive SQL customer behavior analytics with matching business objectives, technical components, and analytical goals. Agent_1_Overview focuses on enterprise alignment and business benefits while Agent_2_Comprehensive emphasizes technical depth and implementation details. Core semantic elements align: customer segmentation, RFM scoring, seasonal analysis, product preferences. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent_1_Overview stresses strategic value while Agent_2_Comprehensive details technical execution. Both correctly identify same tables, CTEs, and analytical functions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All,"Excellent structural alignment with both following 10-section documentation framework: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Performance, Technical Elements, Complexity Analysis, Assumptions, Key Outputs, Error Handling. Agent_1_Overview uses bullet-point summaries while Agent_2_Comprehensive employs detailed prose and comprehensive tables. Section ordering identical except Agent_2_Comprehensive provides more granular subsections. Both use similar logical decomposition and information hierarchy. Data mapping section shows different presentation styles but equivalent content coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Overview,94,Lines 15-20,"Well-formed technical documentation with consistent formatting and accurate technical references. Minor issues: Line 15-20 complexity metrics could be more specific (states '120 lines' without clear source reference). Table structures are properly formatted. Technical terminology used correctly throughout. Internal cross-references are consistent. No syntax errors in code examples or technical descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Comprehensive,96,Lines 45-50,"Highly accurate technical content with detailed data mapping tables and precise technical specifications. Minor issue: Lines 45-50 in data mapping table could benefit from more explicit transformation logic descriptions. Excellent use of technical terminology and consistent formatting throughout. Comprehensive coverage of technical elements with proper syntax. Internal references are accurate and well-maintained."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,95,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and valid technical content. Average correctness score reflects minor documentation precision issues rather than fundamental technical errors. Both maintain internal consistency and provide accurate technical analysis of the Hive SQL implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Overview,N/A,Lines 80-85,"Enhance complexity analysis section with more specific metrics and clearer source attribution for line counts. Consider adding more detailed technical implementation examples to match depth of Agent_2_Comprehensive. Strengthen data mapping section with tabular format for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Comprehensive,N/A,Lines 45-50,"Improve data mapping table descriptions with more explicit transformation logic details. Consider adding executive summary bullets for key findings to enhance accessibility. Maintain current level of technical depth while adding strategic business context similar to Agent_1_Overview."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All,"Both outputs provide excellent technical documentation foundation. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent_1_Overview's strategic focus with Agent_2_Comprehensive's technical depth. Standardize data mapping presentation format. Add performance benchmarking data and real-world optimization examples to enhance practical value."
