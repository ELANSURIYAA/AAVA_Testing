Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comprehensive comparison of two Hive SQL documentation outputs reveals high semantic and structural alignment with excellent correctness. Both Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output provide detailed analysis of customer purchasing behavior analytics using HiveQL. Key differences include Agent_2_Output providing more granular complexity metrics (85/100 vs 75/100) and enhanced technical depth in sections 4-7. Agent_1_Output offers more concise presentation while Agent_2_Output provides expanded data mapping tables and performance optimization details. Both outputs demonstrate enterprise-grade documentation quality with consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage of all analytical dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing customer purchasing behaviors using Hive SQL for enterprise analytics. Agent_1_Output and Agent_2_Output demonstrate nearly identical understanding of business problems, technical approaches, and analytical goals. Minor semantic differences include Agent_2_Output's expanded discussion of RFM scoring (lines 15-20) and more detailed seasonal analysis descriptions (lines 45-50). Both correctly identify the same business benefits: customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and revenue optimization. The analytical frameworks and conclusions are semantically equivalent with 92% alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Exceptional structural alignment with both outputs following identical 10-section organization. Both use consistent numbering (1-10), identical section titles, and similar subsection breakdowns. Agent_1_Output presents 120 lines while Agent_2_Output contains 84 lines, but maintains identical logical flow. Both employ tables for data mapping (section 4) and complexity analysis (section 7). Minor structural differences include Agent_2_Output's more detailed data mapping table (35 rows vs 4 rows in Agent_1_Output lines 65-85) and enhanced performance optimization subsections. Overall structural similarity achieves 95% alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,98,Lines 45-50,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured tables. Minor issues include incomplete complexity analysis table (missing some aggregate function counts in lines 45-50) and abbreviated data mapping section. All section references are accurate and formatting is consistent throughout. No broken links or malformed content detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,99,Line 82,"Agent_2_Output shows near-perfect correctness with comprehensive data mapping, detailed complexity metrics, and consistent formatting. Single minor issue: potential inconsistency in line count reporting (84 lines claimed vs actual content length in line 82). All technical elements are properly documented, tables are well-formatted, and internal references are accurate. Demonstrates superior attention to detail in technical documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average correctness score of 98.5 rounded to 98. Both outputs maintain high standards of technical documentation with minimal syntax or formatting issues. The comprehensive coverage and consistent structure demonstrate enterprise-grade documentation quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,Lines 65-85,"Enhance data mapping section with more comprehensive source-to-target field mappings similar to Agent_2_Output's approach. Consider expanding complexity analysis table with more detailed metrics for aggregate functions and conditional logic counts."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,Line 82,"Verify line count accuracy in complexity analysis section to ensure consistency between reported metrics and actual content length. Consider minor formatting standardization for enhanced readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs represent high-quality enterprise documentation. Consider standardizing on Agent_2_Output's more detailed data mapping approach while maintaining Agent_1_Output's concise presentation style. Both could benefit from adding visual diagrams for complex data flow sections and including sample output formats for enhanced usability."
