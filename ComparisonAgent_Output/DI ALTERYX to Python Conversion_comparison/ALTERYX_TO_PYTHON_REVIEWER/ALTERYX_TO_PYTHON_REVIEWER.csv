Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,All lines,"Both agents produced comprehensive validation reports for Alteryx to Python conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100) but different structural approaches. Agent 1 used a concise emoji-based format while Agent 2 provided detailed sectioned analysis. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,All lines,"Both outputs address the same core objective of validating Alteryx workflow to Python code conversion. They cover identical validation aspects including data input/output, joins, aggregations, schema validation, and error handling. Key semantic alignment includes: conversion accuracy assessment (85% vs 98%), similar recommendations for schema validation and error handling, and consistent identification of missing components like SQL DDL statements. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses more on specific missing logic while Agent 2 provides broader coverage including test cases and API costs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,Lines 1-50 vs 1-100,"Significant structural differences detected. Agent 1 uses a compact format with emoji indicators (✅❌🔍) and bullet-point organization across 6 main sections. Agent 2 employs a comprehensive sectioned approach with 11 detailed sections including tables, test case coverage, and API cost analysis. Both follow logical validation flow but with different decomposition strategies. Agent 1 prioritizes conciseness while Agent 2 emphasizes thoroughness and documentation completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,100,All lines,"Agent 1 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent emoji usage, valid bullet point structure, and no broken references or formatting errors. All sections are properly organized and readable."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,All lines,"Agent 2 output is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, valid table structure, consistent section numbering, and no syntax errors. All references and formatting are internally consistent and well-formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or structural issues detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,Lines 40-50,"Consider expanding the analysis to include test case coverage and API cost considerations as shown in Agent 2. Add more detailed section organization for better navigation and reference."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,Lines 80-100,"Consider adopting more concise presentation format with visual indicators for quick scanning as demonstrated in Agent 1. Some sections could be consolidated for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,All lines,"Both outputs would benefit from standardized formatting conventions. Consider hybrid approach combining Agent 1's visual clarity with Agent 2's comprehensive coverage for optimal validation reporting."
