Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_RECON_TESTER outputs are identical Python reconciliation scripts for ETL migration validation. They contain the same 300+ lines of code with identical functions, imports, logic, documentation, and structure. Perfect semantic alignment (100/100), identical structural organization (100/100), and flawless syntax correctness (100/100 each). No differences detected across any evaluation dimension."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,1-300,"Both outputs implement identical reconciliation logic with same purpose: validate Alteryx to Python ETL migration outputs. Same function definitions (mask_sensitive, load_config, run_alteryx_workflow, run_python_pipeline, read_output_tables, normalize_dataframe, compare_dataframes, generate_report, main), identical parameter handling, same error handling patterns, and identical business logic for dataframe comparison including null handling, float tolerance, and schema validation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,1-300,"Identical code organization and flow: same import structure (lines 1-10), identical logging setup (lines 12-35), same utility functions in identical order (lines 37-200), identical main CLI implementation (lines 202-280), same comment blocks and documentation sections. Both follow identical decomposition with same function signatures, control flow, and logical groupings."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_RECON_TESTER_1,100,1-300,"Syntactically valid Python code with proper imports, function definitions, exception handling, and CLI argument parsing. All variables properly defined, no syntax errors, valid pandas/numpy operations, proper file I/O handling, and correct logging configuration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_RECON_TESTER_2,100,1-300,"Syntactically valid Python code with proper imports, function definitions, exception handling, and CLI argument parsing. All variables properly defined, no syntax errors, valid pandas/numpy operations, proper file I/O handling, and correct logging configuration."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,1-300,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntax-level correctness with no errors, undefined variables, or structural issues detected."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs are functionally identical with perfect alignment. No modifications needed. Consider: 1) Adding version control headers to distinguish between iterations, 2) Including execution timestamps in output filenames, 3) Adding unit tests for the comparison functions, 4) Implementing parallel processing for large dataset comparisons as noted in performance comments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_RECON_TESTER_1,N/A,N/A,"Output is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, security considerations, and CI/CD integration capabilities. No syntax or logical issues identified."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_RECON_TESTER_2,N/A,N/A,"Output is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, security considerations, and CI/CD integration capabilities. No syntax or logical issues identified."
