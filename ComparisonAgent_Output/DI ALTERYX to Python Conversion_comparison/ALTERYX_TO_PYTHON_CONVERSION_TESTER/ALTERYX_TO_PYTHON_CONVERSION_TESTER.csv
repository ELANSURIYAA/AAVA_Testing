Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-300","Both outputs provide test case documentation and pytest scripts for validating Python ETL transformations. Agent 1 delivers a concise 5-test-case approach focusing on basic ETL operations (file reading, data cleaning, joins, aggregation, output). Agent 2 provides a comprehensive 8-test-case suite with detailed tabular format, advanced transformation logic, dimension/fact table validation, and robust error handling. Agent 2 demonstrates superior test coverage, documentation structure, and enterprise-grade testing practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-100","Both outputs address ETL testing validation but with different scope and depth. Agent 1 focuses on basic data pipeline operations while Agent 2 covers advanced data warehousing concepts including dimension tables, fact tables, and complex transformations. Core intent aligns (ETL validation) but Agent 2 addresses more sophisticated business requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-150 vs 1-300","Agent 1 uses simple markdown structure with basic test case format. Agent 2 employs professional tabular format for test cases, comprehensive fixture setup, and structured test execution reporting template. Both follow test case -> pytest script pattern but Agent 2 has superior organization with clear sections, fixtures, and logging."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,85,"Lines 51-150","Pytest script has valid syntax and structure. Minor issues: Line 15 - missing error handling for file operations, Line 35 - hardcoded file paths without validation, Line 45 - basic assertion without detailed error messages. SQLAlchemy usage is correct but lacks connection error handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 101-300","Excellent pytest structure with proper fixtures, logging, and comprehensive test coverage. Minor issue: Line 180 - potential KeyError in transformation function not handled gracefully in all edge cases. Mock transformation function is well-structured with proper error handling and data type validation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent scores","Both outputs demonstrate strong technical correctness with Agent 2 showing superior implementation practices."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Lines 15,35,45","Add comprehensive error handling for file operations and database connections. Implement parameterized test data instead of hardcoded paths. Enhance assertion messages with detailed failure descriptions. Consider adding test fixtures for better test isolation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Lines 180,250","Add more robust exception handling in mock transformation function for edge cases. Consider adding performance benchmarking tests for large datasets. The comprehensive approach is excellent - maintain this level of detail and structure for production use."
