Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-35 vs 1-120,"Two distinct approaches to Alteryx-to-Python conversion with significant differences in scope and implementation depth. Basic_Converter provides a simplified 35-line conversion focusing on core pandas operations, while AAVA_Converter delivers a comprehensive 120-line enterprise solution with detailed data warehousing, dimension tables, and database integration."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,65,"Lines 1-35 vs 1-120","Both outputs address Alteryx-to-Python conversion but with different interpretations of scope. Basic_Converter focuses on fundamental ETL operations (read, clean, join, aggregate, output) while AAVA_Converter implements a complete data warehousing solution with dimension modeling, fact tables, and database schema creation. Core intent overlaps but execution philosophy differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,45,"Lines 1-35 vs 1-120","Structural approaches diverge substantially. Basic_Converter follows linear ETL flow (6 steps) while AAVA_Converter uses modular data warehousing architecture (Input > Cleaning > Dimension Creation > Fact Tables > Database Operations). Both use pandas but AAVA_Converter adds SQLAlchemy, datetime handling, and comprehensive data modeling absent in Basic_Converter."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Basic_Converter,85,"Lines 8-9, 15-16, 22-23","Syntactically correct pandas operations with proper imports. Minor issues: generic column names ('raw_column', 'common_key', 'group_key') suggest placeholder code rather than production-ready implementation. SQLAlchemy connection string lacks proper parameters."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Converter,92,"Lines 45-46, 89-90, 108-110","Highly detailed implementation with proper error handling and realistic column operations. Minor syntax concerns: hardcoded file paths may cause portability issues, and some operations assume column existence without validation. Overall demonstrates production-quality code structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,89,,"Average correctness score reflecting both implementations' syntactic validity with AAVA_Converter showing superior attention to real-world implementation details."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Basic_Converter,,"Lines 8-9, 15-16, 22-23","Replace placeholder column names with actual Alteryx workflow column references. Add error handling for file operations and database connections. Include data validation steps before transformations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Converter,,"Lines 12-17, 108-110","Replace hardcoded file paths with configurable parameters or environment variables. Add exception handling for file reading operations. Consider parameterizing database connection strings for different environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"AAVA_Converter provides superior enterprise-ready solution but may be over-engineered for simple ETL tasks. Basic_Converter offers good starting point but requires significant enhancement for production use. Consider hybrid approach: Basic_Converter's simplicity with AAVA_Converter's comprehensive data modeling."
