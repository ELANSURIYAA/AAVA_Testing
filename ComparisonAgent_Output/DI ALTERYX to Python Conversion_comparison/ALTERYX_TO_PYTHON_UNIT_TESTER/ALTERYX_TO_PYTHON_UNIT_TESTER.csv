Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,100,"Lines 1-200","Both agent outputs are functionally identical test documentation for Alteryx to Python ETL conversion. They contain identical analysis sections, test case designs, and pytest implementations. The outputs demonstrate comprehensive test coverage for data transformation workflows including dimension/fact table creation, data cleaning, and error handling. No meaningful differences detected across semantic, structural, or correctness dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-200","Perfect semantic alignment. Both outputs address identical ETL transformation requirements with same test objectives: validate data cleaning (lexeme_string replacement), dimension table creation, language mapping, morphological component counting, and error handling. Test case descriptions and expected results are identical across all 8 test scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,100,"Lines 1-200","Identical structural organization: Section 1 (Analysis with Inputs/Transformation Logic/Output Structure), Section 2 (Test Case Design table with 8 test cases TC01-TC08), Section 3 (Pytest Script with imports, mock function, fixtures, and test implementations). Code structure, function definitions, and logical flow are identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_UNIT_TESTER_Output1,100,"Lines 15-200","Valid Python syntax throughout. Proper pytest structure with fixtures, logging setup, and test functions. Mock transformation function implements all required ETL operations correctly. Exception handling in TC08 properly structured with try/catch blocks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_UNIT_TESTER_Output2,100,"Lines 15-200","Identical Python syntax validation. Same pytest structure, fixtures, and test implementations. Mock function contains same ETL transformation logic. Exception handling matches Output1 exactly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with valid Python/pytest code, proper imports, consistent variable naming, and appropriate exception handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_UNIT_TESTER_Output1,100,"Lines 1-200","Output is comprehensive and well-structured. Consider adding more edge cases for timestamp boundary testing and additional error scenarios for malformed CSV inputs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,ALTERYX_TO_PYTHON_UNIT_TESTER_Output2,100,"Lines 1-200","Identical to Output1. Same recommendation applies: enhance edge case coverage and add more comprehensive error handling test scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,100,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs are production-ready test documentation. Consider expanding test coverage to include: 1) Performance testing for large datasets, 2) Database connection failure scenarios, 3) Memory usage validation for 13M record processing, 4) Concurrent user testing scenarios."
