Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Two PySpark implementations for processing sales data with different architectural approaches. First implementation uses file-based operations with explicit temporary DataFrame handling, while second uses Hive integration with streamlined bulk operations. Both achieve the same core objective but with varying efficiency and complexity levels."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-45 vs Lines 1-50","Both outputs address the same core goal of processing sales data within date ranges and aggregating by product_id. Agent 1 uses file-based parquet operations while Agent 2 uses Hive table integration. The semantic intent is highly aligned - both filter by date range, group by product_id, and sum sales. Minor divergence in storage approach (file vs table) and processing methodology (explicit temp handling vs bulk operations)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 8-45 vs Lines 20-45","Different structural approaches: Agent 1 follows a 6-step procedural flow with explicit temporary DataFrame creation and row-by-row processing (lines 25-35). Agent 2 uses a more streamlined 5-step approach with bulk operations and Hive integration (lines 20-40). Both use similar groupBy and aggregation patterns but differ in data source handling and temporary object management."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,88,"Lines 25-35, Line 44","Syntax is valid with proper PySpark imports and session handling. Minor inefficiency in lines 25-35 where collect() and row-by-row processing could cause performance issues with large datasets. Line 44 uses unpersist() on a DataFrame that may not be cached, which is harmless but unnecessary."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,92,"Lines 22-23, Line 35","Syntax is mostly correct with proper Hive integration. Minor issue on lines 22-23 where f-string syntax is mixed with standard string formatting in filter conditions. Line 35 properly handles temporary view cleanup. Overall more efficient approach with bulk operations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of both agents' correctness scores. Both implementations are syntactically sound with minor optimization opportunities."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Replace collect() and row-by-row processing (lines 25-35) with bulk DataFrame operations for better performance. Remove unnecessary unpersist() call on line 44. Consider using Hive integration for better enterprise compatibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Fix f-string syntax inconsistency in filter conditions (lines 22-23). Add error handling for table existence checks. Consider adding explicit caching for reused DataFrames to optimize performance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both implementations would benefit from parameterization of file/table paths, addition of logging for monitoring, and error handling for production readiness. Agent_2's approach is more suitable for enterprise environments with existing Hive infrastructure."
