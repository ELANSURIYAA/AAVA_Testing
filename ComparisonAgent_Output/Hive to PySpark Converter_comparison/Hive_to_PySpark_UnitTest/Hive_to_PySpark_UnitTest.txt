# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Two fundamentally different outputs were analyzed: Input_1 reports missing PySpark code and presence of Hive SQL files with minimal API cost (0.02 USD), while Input_2 provides comprehensive PySpark test cases with 10 detailed test scenarios and pytest implementations with higher API cost (2 units). The outputs serve completely different purposes with no semantic overlap.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 15/100)

The outputs address entirely different objectives. Input_1 focuses on file availability and format mismatch issues, communicating that the expected PySpark code is not available in the provided files and only Hive SQL code exists. Input_2 provides comprehensive test case specifications for PySpark sales data processing, including detailed test scenarios and complete pytest implementations. There is no shared semantic intent or overlapping functionality between these outputs.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 10/100)

The outputs employ completely different structural approaches. Input_1 uses a simple narrative message format consisting of 4 lines that communicate a status update about file availability. Input_2 employs a highly structured test case documentation format with test case IDs (TC01-TC10), descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest code blocks spanning over 150 lines. There is no structural commonality between these approaches.

### Correctness

**Input_1 (Score: 95/100)**: The output is syntactically correct with proper grammar and clear communication. The message effectively conveys the issue about missing PySpark code and the presence of Hive SQL files instead. Minor deduction for lack of structured format that might be expected in technical documentation contexts.

**Input_2 (Score: 98/100)**: Highly structured and syntactically correct pytest code with proper imports, fixtures, and test implementations. The test cases cover comprehensive scenarios including happy path, edge cases, error handling, and performance considerations. Minor deduction for potential edge case handling that could be more explicit in some test scenarios.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 97/100)**: Average of individual correctness scores.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Input_1 | Input_2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 15 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 10 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **41** |

## Recommendations

**For Input_1**: Consider providing more structured output format with clear sections for file analysis results, recommendations for next steps, and technical specifications. This would improve usability and professional presentation.

**For Input_2**: Excellent comprehensive test coverage with well-structured pytest implementations. Consider adding integration test scenarios and performance test cases for large datasets beyond TC10 to further enhance the testing framework.
