Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-10 vs Lines 1-200+,"The two agent outputs represent fundamentally different responses to what appears to be a Hive to PySpark conversion task. Hive_SQL_Agent (Output 1) provides a brief status message indicating missing PySpark source code and mentions only Hive SQL availability, while PySpark_TestCase_Agent (Output 2) delivers a comprehensive test suite with 10 detailed test cases and complete pytest implementation. The outputs show minimal semantic alignment (15/100) as they address different aspects of the task, completely different structural approaches (10/100), but both maintain good internal correctness (95/100 and 92/100 respectively)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-200+,"Hive_SQL_Agent focuses on identifying missing PySpark source code and availability constraints, while PySpark_TestCase_Agent assumes the code exists and provides comprehensive testing framework. Both relate to PySpark processing but address entirely different phases - problem identification vs solution testing. The semantic gap is substantial as one agent reports inability to proceed while the other provides full implementation testing."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,Lines 1-3 vs Lines 1-200+,"Hive_SQL_Agent uses a simple status report structure (problem statement + cost), while PySpark_TestCase_Agent employs a complex hierarchical structure with test case descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest implementation with fixtures, test functions, and assertions. No structural commonality exists between a brief status message and a comprehensive test suite."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Hive_SQL_Agent,95,Lines 1-3,"Output is syntactically correct with proper sentence structure and clear communication. Minor issue: the phrase 'The API cost for this process is 0.02 USD' could be more formally integrated. All statements are internally consistent and the message clearly conveys the constraint situation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,PySpark_TestCase_Agent,92,Lines 15-200+,"Python/pytest code is syntactically valid with proper imports, function definitions, and test structure. Minor issues include: Line 23 - potential issue with f-string usage in filter conditions that should use col() function for better PySpark practices, Line 45-50 - some test assertions could be more robust with explicit error handling. Overall structure and implementation are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 94. Both outputs maintain good internal consistency and syntactic correctness within their respective domains."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Hive_SQL_Agent,N/A,Lines 1-3,"Should provide more specific guidance on locating or obtaining the required PySpark source code. Consider suggesting alternative approaches or requesting clarification on source code location. The cost reporting is useful but could be more detailed about what operations consumed the API units."
Recommendations,Recommendation,PySpark_TestCase_Agent,N/A,Lines 15-200+,"Excellent comprehensive test coverage. Recommend improving PySpark best practices in the process_sales_data function by using col() function instead of string-based filtering. Consider adding more edge case validations and error handling in test assertions. The test structure and coverage are exemplary for a PySpark data processing pipeline."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"The outputs suggest a coordination gap - one agent identifies missing source code while another provides tests assuming code exists. Recommend implementing a validation step to ensure source code availability before test generation, or alternatively, provide both constraint identification and conditional test implementation in a coordinated response."
