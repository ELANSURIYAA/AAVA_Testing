Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-4 vs 1-150,"Two fundamentally different outputs: Input_1 reports missing PySpark code and presence of Hive SQL files with minimal API cost (0.02 USD), while Input_2 provides comprehensive PySpark test cases with 10 detailed test scenarios and pytest implementations with higher API cost (2 units). Outputs serve completely different purposes with no semantic overlap."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,15,1-4 vs 1-150,"Outputs address entirely different objectives. Input_1 focuses on file availability and format mismatch issues, while Input_2 provides comprehensive test case specifications for PySpark sales data processing. No shared semantic intent or overlapping functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,10,1-4 vs 1-150,"Completely different structural approaches. Input_1 uses simple narrative message format (4 lines), while Input_2 employs structured test case documentation with IDs, descriptions, expected outcomes, and complete pytest code blocks (150+ lines). No structural commonality."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Input_1,95,1-4,"Syntactically correct message with proper grammar and clear communication. Minor deduction for lack of structured format that might be expected in technical documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Input_2,98,1-150,"Highly structured and syntactically correct pytest code with proper imports, fixtures, and test implementations. Minor deduction for potential edge case handling that could be more explicit in some test scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Input_1,,1-4,"Consider providing more structured output format with clear sections for file analysis results, recommendations for next steps, and technical specifications."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Input_2,,1-150,"Excellent comprehensive test coverage. Consider adding integration test scenarios and performance test cases for large datasets beyond TC10."
