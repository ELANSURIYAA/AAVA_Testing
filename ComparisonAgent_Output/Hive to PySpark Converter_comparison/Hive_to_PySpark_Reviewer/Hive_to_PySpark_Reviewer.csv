Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs analyze HiveQL to PySpark conversion with high semantic alignment (85/100). Agent_1_Summary provides concise analysis while Agent_2_Detailed_Review offers comprehensive examination with code examples. Structural approaches differ significantly (65/100) - Agent_1_Summary uses summary format while Agent_2_Detailed_Review follows detailed review structure. Both outputs are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective of analyzing HiveQL to PySpark conversion accuracy. Key semantic alignments: (1) Both identify correct DataFrame filtering implementation, (2) Both recognize proper aggregation using groupBy and sum functions, (3) Both note cursor vs batch processing differences, (4) Both suggest optimization improvements. Semantic differences: Agent_1_Summary focuses on functional equivalence (lines 4-8) while Agent_2_Detailed_Review emphasizes code structure and best practices (lines 45-60). Agent_2_Detailed_Review provides more granular analysis of specific code constructs."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,N/A,"Structural approaches differ significantly. Agent_1_Summary follows summary format: Summary→Conversion Accuracy→Discrepancies→Optimization→Assessment→Recommendations (6 sections). Agent_2_Detailed_Review uses detailed review structure: Summary→Original Code→Converted Code→Conversion Accuracy→Discrepancies→Optimization→Assessment→Recommendations (8 sections with code blocks). Both maintain logical flow from analysis to recommendations, but Agent_2_Detailed_Review includes actual code examples (lines 10-44, 46-85) while Agent_1_Summary references code conceptually."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Summary,100,N/A,"Agent_1_Summary is syntactically correct with proper grammar, consistent terminology, and well-formed sentences. All technical references are accurate. No syntax errors, undefined terms, or broken internal references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Detailed_Review,100,N/A,"Agent_2_Detailed_Review is syntactically correct with proper code formatting, valid SQL and Python syntax in examples, consistent section headers, and accurate technical terminology. Code blocks are properly formatted and executable. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness. Average score: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100. No syntax issues, formatting problems, or internal inconsistencies found in either output."
