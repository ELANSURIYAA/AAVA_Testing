Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two PostgreSQL documentation outputs for pnp_daily_ach function. Agent_1_Documentation provides a structured overview with 7 main sections covering purpose, structure, data flow, mapping, complexity, outputs, and error handling. Agent_2_Documentation delivers a more comprehensive 9-section analysis with enhanced detail in processing logic, data mapping (extensive table with 40+ mappings), and field descriptions. Both documents address the same ACH transaction processing function but differ significantly in depth and completeness. Agent_2_Documentation demonstrates superior technical depth with step-by-step processing logic, detailed transformation descriptions, and comprehensive field documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both documents address the identical PostgreSQL function pnp_daily_ach for ACH transaction processing. Core semantic elements align well: both describe ETL operations, transaction classification (PERSON/BUSINESS/UNIDENTIFIABLE), data enrichment, and business rule applications. Agent_1_Documentation focuses on high-level business problem solving and data flow concepts. Agent_2_Documentation provides deeper semantic context with detailed step-by-step processing logic (lines 45-120), comprehensive transformation descriptions, and business rule explanations. Minor semantic divergence in emphasis: Agent_1_Documentation emphasizes compliance and operational efficiency (lines 8-12), while Agent_2_Documentation focuses on fraud detection and regulatory compliance (lines 12-15). Both maintain consistent semantic understanding of the core ACH processing workflow."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both documents follow similar high-level structural patterns with numbered sections and consistent formatting. Agent_1_Documentation uses 7 main sections: Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Complexity Analysis, Key Outputs, Error Handling (lines 1-150). Agent_2_Documentation expands to 9 sections, adding Field Descriptions and Summary sections (lines 1-280). Structural alignment is strong in sections 1-7, with both using similar headings and subsection organization. Key structural differences: Agent_2_Documentation provides more granular subsections in Data Flow (Step 0-9 breakdown, lines 45-120) versus Agent_1_Documentation's simpler Step 0-4 approach (lines 35-55). Data Mapping section shows significant structural divergence: Agent_1_Documentation provides 5 mappings (lines 70-85) while Agent_2_Documentation includes 40+ detailed mappings with comprehensive source-target relationships (lines 140-200)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Documentation,95,N/A,"Agent_1_Documentation demonstrates high syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structures, and valid internal references. All section numbering is sequential and logical (1-7). Table formatting in Data Mapping (lines 70-85) and Complexity Analysis (lines 90-110) follows proper markdown syntax. Field descriptions are internally consistent with no broken references. Minor issues: Some table entries could benefit from more specific data types in the 'Remarks' column (lines 75-82). Overall structure is well-formed with appropriate use of headers, bullet points, and tables."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Documentation,98,N/A,"Agent_2_Documentation exhibits excellent syntactic correctness with comprehensive markdown formatting, extensive table structures, and detailed internal consistency. All 9 sections are properly numbered and formatted (lines 1-280). The extensive Data Mapping table (lines 140-200) maintains consistent column structure across 40+ entries. Field descriptions table (lines 250-270) is well-formatted with proper alignment. Exception handling code references are accurate and properly formatted (lines 230-240). No syntax errors or broken internal references detected. Superior organization with proper use of headers, subheaders, bullet points, tables, and code formatting."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Average correctness score of 96.5, rounded to 97. Both documents demonstrate high syntactic quality with proper formatting and internal consistency. Agent_2_Documentation shows slightly superior correctness due to more comprehensive structure validation and extensive cross-referencing without errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Documentation,N/A,Lines 70-85,"Enhance the Data Mapping section by expanding from 5 to comprehensive mappings covering all transformation steps. Add more detailed step-by-step processing logic similar to Agent_2_Documentation's approach (lines 45-120). Include field descriptions section for better technical reference. Consider adding Summary section for executive overview."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Documentation,N/A,Lines 140-200,"Excellent comprehensive documentation. Consider adding visual diagrams to complement the extensive textual descriptions. The Data Mapping table could benefit from grouping related transformations for easier navigation. Consider adding cross-references between sections to improve document navigation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both documents would benefit from version control information and last updated timestamps. Consider standardizing the complexity scoring methodology across similar documentation efforts. Add glossary section for technical terms and acronyms used throughout the documentation."
