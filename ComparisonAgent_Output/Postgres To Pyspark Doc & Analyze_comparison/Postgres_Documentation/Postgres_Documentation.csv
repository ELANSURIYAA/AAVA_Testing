Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-200","Both agents produced comprehensive documentation for the PostgreSQL pnp_daily_ach function. Agent 1 provides a more concise overview while Agent 2 offers more detailed technical specifications and step-by-step processing logic. Both documents serve the purpose of documenting ACH transaction processing functionality."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 60-80","Both documents address the same core functionality - ACH transaction processing, classification, and data enrichment. Agent 1 focuses on business problem solving and ETL operations, while Agent 2 provides more granular technical details including schema references and specific function calls. Minor semantic differences in emphasis and technical depth."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-200","Both follow structured documentation format with similar sections (Overview, Code Structure, Data Flow, Complexity Analysis). Agent 1 uses 7 main sections while Agent 2 uses 9 sections with more granular breakdown. Agent 2 includes additional sections like Field Descriptions and Summary that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,92,"Lines 45-60, 120-140","Minor inconsistencies in complexity metrics table formatting and some generic placeholder values. Table structure is valid but some metrics appear estimated rather than calculated. Overall syntax and internal references are consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,96,"Lines 80-120, 180-200","Highly consistent internal structure with proper schema references (moneymovement_source), detailed step-by-step logic, and comprehensive field descriptions. Minor formatting inconsistencies in data mapping table continuation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (92 + 96) / 2 = 94"
