Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis with complexity metrics, syntax differences, and optimization recommendations. Agent 1 delivers a concise structured format while Agent 2 provides detailed session-based documentation with extensive best practices."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Both outputs address PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis with high semantic alignment. Both cover complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. Agent 2 provides more comprehensive coverage with additional sections on data types, best practices, and detailed cost analysis. Minor divergence in emphasis - Agent 1 focuses on quantitative metrics while Agent 2 emphasizes practical implementation guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,72,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-200 (Agent 2)","Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1-6) with bullet points and structured metrics. Agent 2 uses session-based markdown format with hierarchical subsections (1-9 per session). Both follow logical progression from complexity assessment to recommendations, but different organizational approaches. Agent 2 includes summary tables and cost tracking that Agent 1 lacks."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Well-formed structured format with consistent numbering and clear metrics. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost presentation (0.0032 USD vs standard currency format). All technical terms and concepts are correctly used."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,98,"Lines 50-60, 180-190","Excellent markdown formatting with proper headers, lists, and tables. Consistent structure across sessions. All technical content is syntactically correct with proper code examples and references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting for their respective styles. Agent 2 shows slightly better consistency in formatting standards."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider adopting more detailed documentation structure similar to Agent 2. Add summary tables and cost tracking for better usability. Enhance formatting consistency especially for currency values."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain current comprehensive approach. Consider adding more quantitative metrics similar to Agent 1 for quick reference. Ensure session-based format doesn't create redundancy in future iterations."
