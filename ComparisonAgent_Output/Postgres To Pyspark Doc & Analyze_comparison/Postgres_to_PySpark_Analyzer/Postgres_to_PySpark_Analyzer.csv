Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analyses with overlapping content but different presentation styles. Agent 1 delivers a concise, structured analysis (379 lines, 13 tables, complexity score 85/100) while Agent 2 provides comprehensive documentation with detailed breakdowns across multiple sessions (243 lines for main analysis, complexity score 82/100). Both identify similar syntax differences and optimization needs, though Agent 2 offers more extensive coverage of best practices and implementation strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (Agent 1), Lines 1-100 (Agent 2)","Both agents address PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analysis with highly similar core intent. They identify the same fundamental challenges: syntax differences (5 vs 14 identified), complexity scoring (85 vs 82), and optimization needs. Agent 2 provides more granular analysis with additional sessions and detailed breakdowns, but both reach consistent conclusions about conversion complexity and required manual adjustments. Minor divergence in emphasis: Agent 1 focuses on metrics aggregation while Agent 2 emphasizes procedural transformation details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-379 (Agent 1), Lines 1-300+ (Agent 2)","Both follow similar analytical frameworks with numbered sections covering complexity metrics, conversion complexity, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. However, structural differences exist: Agent 1 uses a single-session format with 6 main sections, while Agent 2 employs a multi-session approach with 9+ sections per session. Agent 2 includes additional structural elements like summary tables, API cost breakdowns, and best practices sections that Agent 1 lacks. Flow similarity exists but presentation architecture differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-25, 45-55","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with properly formatted numbered lists, consistent metric reporting, and valid technical terminology. Minor issues: inconsistent table name formatting in line 15 (mixing schema.table patterns), and potential overcounting of DML statements in lines 45-55 where some operations may be double-counted across different categories."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,95,"Lines 50-60, 150-160","Agent 2 shows excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section headers, and well-structured technical content. Very minor issues: occasional inconsistent spacing in table references around lines 50-60, and minor formatting variations in cost reporting sections around lines 150-160. Overall maintains high structural integrity throughout the extensive documentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both agents demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with proper formatting and technical accuracy. Agent 2 slightly outperforms due to more consistent formatting standards and comprehensive structure validation. Average of individual scores: (92 + 95) / 2 = 93.5, rounded to 94."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance structural presentation by adopting multi-session format for complex analyses. Add summary tables and cost breakdowns for better stakeholder communication. Include best practices sections to provide actionable implementation guidance beyond technical metrics."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Maintain comprehensive documentation approach while considering executive summary formats for time-constrained stakeholders. Consider consolidating redundant sections across sessions to improve readability. Standardize formatting consistency in table references and cost reporting sections."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both agents provide valuable PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion analyses. Combine Agent 1's concise metric focus with Agent 2's comprehensive coverage for optimal results. Standardize complexity scoring methodology and ensure consistent table counting approaches across analyses."
