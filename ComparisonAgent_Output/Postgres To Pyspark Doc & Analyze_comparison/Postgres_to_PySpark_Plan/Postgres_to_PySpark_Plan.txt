# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimates for PostgreSQL to PySpark migration. Cost_Estimation_Agent delivers concise structured analysis ($9 runtime, 38 hours effort), while Migration_Analysis_Agent provides detailed markdown documentation ($8.10 runtime, 32-44 hours effort). Both reach similar conclusions with different presentation styles.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

High semantic alignment on core objectives and calculations. Both estimate similar runtime costs ($8-9), data processing volumes (~430-435 GB), and total effort (32-44 hours). Migration_Analysis_Agent provides more granular breakdown and reasoning, while Cost_Estimation_Agent is more direct. Minor differences in DBU assumptions (10 vs 12) and effort ranges.

**Key Alignments:**
- Both process ~10% of 4.3TB data (~430-435 GB)
- Similar Databricks pricing assumptions ($0.15-$0.75 per DBU)
- Comparable runtime estimates (1.5-2 hours)
- Similar total effort estimates (32-44 hours range)

**Minor Differences:**
- DBU allocation: Cost_Estimation_Agent uses 10 DBUs, Migration_Analysis_Agent uses 12 DBUs
- Effort presentation: Cost_Estimation_Agent gives exact 38 hours, Migration_Analysis_Agent provides 32-44 hour range

### Structural Similarity (Score: 75/100)

Similar logical flow: Cost estimation → Effort analysis → API cost → Summary. Cost_Estimation_Agent uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1, etc.), Migration_Analysis_Agent uses markdown headers. Both include similar subsections but Migration_Analysis_Agent has additional summary table and notes sections. Different formatting approaches but consistent information architecture.

**Structural Comparison:**
- Both follow: Runtime Cost → Code/Testing Effort → API Cost → Summary
- Cost_Estimation_Agent: Numbered hierarchy (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Migration_Analysis_Agent: Markdown headers with subsections
- Migration_Analysis_Agent includes additional summary table and notes sections

### Correctness

**Cost_Estimation_Agent (Score: 95/100)**
Syntactically correct structured text format. Clear numbering system, proper calculations, consistent formatting. Minor issue: some bullet points could be better aligned (lines 8-12).

**Migration_Analysis_Agent (Score: 98/100)**
Excellent markdown syntax throughout. Proper headers, tables, bullet points, and formatting. All calculations are clearly presented and documented. Very minor: could use consistent spacing in table (line 95).

**Overall Correctness: 97/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Cost_Estimation_Agent | Migration_Analysis_Agent | Overall |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 75 |
| Correctness | 95 | 98 | 97 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For Cost_Estimation_Agent:**
Consider adding more detailed breakdown of effort estimation methodology and include summary table for better readability. The concise format is valuable but could benefit from additional context.

**For Migration_Analysis_Agent:**
Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing DBU assumptions with other estimates and ensure consistency in effort range presentation (32-44 hours vs specific values).

**For Both:**
Both outputs provide valuable perspectives - Cost_Estimation_Agent offers quick reference format while Migration_Analysis_Agent provides detailed documentation. Consider combining approaches for optimal stakeholder communication.
