Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,"Lines 1-38 (Agent1), Lines 1-95 (Agent2)","Both outputs provide comprehensive cost and effort estimations for PostgreSQL to PySpark conversion. Agent2 provides more detailed breakdown and professional formatting with markdown structure, while Agent1 offers a more concise summary. Key differences: runtime costs ($9.00 vs $8.10), effort estimates (38 hours vs 32-44 hours), and API costs ($0.0032 vs $0.0063). Both address the same core requirements but with different levels of granularity."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15 (Agent1), Lines 1-45 (Agent2)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: PySpark runtime cost estimation, code fixing/testing effort, and API costs. Agent1 estimates $9.00 runtime cost with 38 hours effort, while Agent2 estimates $8.10 with 32-44 hours. Both use similar calculation methodologies (DBU pricing, data volume processing, effort per table/transformation). Minor differences in assumptions: Agent1 uses 10 DBUs for 2 hours, Agent2 uses 12 DBUs for 1.5 hours. Both conclude with similar order-of-magnitude estimates."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-38 (Agent1), Lines 1-95 (Agent2)","Agent1 uses numbered hierarchical structure (1. Cost Estimation, 1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost, 2. Code Fixing, etc.) while Agent2 uses markdown formatting with headers and sub-headers. Both follow logical flow: cost estimation first, then effort estimation, then summary. Agent2 includes additional sections like summary table and notes that Agent1 lacks. Agent1 has flatter structure with bullet points, Agent2 has deeper nested structure with detailed breakdowns. Core logical progression is similar but presentation differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent1,95,"Lines 1-38","Agent1 output is syntactically correct with proper numbering, consistent formatting, and valid calculations. All mathematical operations are accurate (2 * 10 * $0.45 = $9.00, 24 + 14 = 38 hours). Structure is internally consistent with proper hierarchical numbering. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,98,"Lines 1-95","Agent2 output demonstrates excellent markdown syntax with proper headers, formatting, and table structure. All calculations are mathematically correct (12 * 1.5 * $0.45 = $8.10). Markdown formatting is valid throughout including proper table syntax, bullet points, and header hierarchy. Professional documentation structure with consistent formatting standards."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness. Agent2 scores slightly higher due to more sophisticated formatting and professional documentation standards. Agent1 maintains good structure but with simpler formatting. Average of 95 and 98 equals 96.5, rounded to 97."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent1,80,"Lines 16-25, 32-38","Agent1 provides clear, concise estimates but could benefit from: (1) More detailed breakdown of assumptions and calculations, (2) Range estimates instead of point estimates, (3) Additional context on cluster sizing decisions, (4) Professional formatting improvements, (5) Summary table for better readability."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,92,"Lines 46-95","Agent2 demonstrates excellent documentation practices with comprehensive analysis. Minor improvements could include: (1) Reconciling the slight discrepancy in API costs with Agent1, (2) Providing more specific guidance on cluster optimization, (3) Adding risk factors and mitigation strategies, (4) Including deployment and maintenance considerations in cost estimates."
