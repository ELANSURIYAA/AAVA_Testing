Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-50 (Cost_Estimation_Agent), Lines 1-120 (Migration_Analysis_Agent)","Both agents provide comprehensive cost and effort estimates for PostgreSQL to PySpark migration. Cost_Estimation_Agent delivers concise structured analysis ($9 runtime, 38 hours effort), while Migration_Analysis_Agent provides detailed markdown documentation ($8.10 runtime, 32-44 hours effort). Both reach similar conclusions with different presentation styles."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-15 vs 1-25 (cost section), Lines 16-35 vs 26-80 (effort section)","High semantic alignment on core objectives and calculations. Both estimate similar runtime costs ($8-9), data processing volumes (~430-435 GB), and total effort (32-44 hours). Migration_Analysis_Agent provides more granular breakdown and reasoning, while Cost_Estimation_Agent is more direct. Minor differences in DBU assumptions (10 vs 12) and effort ranges."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-50 vs 1-120 (overall structure)","Similar logical flow: Cost estimation → Effort analysis → API cost → Summary. Cost_Estimation_Agent uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1, etc.), Migration_Analysis_Agent uses markdown headers. Both include similar subsections but Migration_Analysis_Agent has additional summary table and notes sections. Different formatting approaches but consistent information architecture."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Cost_Estimation_Agent,95,"Lines 1-50","Syntactically correct structured text format. Clear numbering system, proper calculations, consistent formatting. Minor issue: some bullet points could be better aligned (lines 8-12)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Migration_Analysis_Agent,98,"Lines 1-120","Excellent markdown syntax throughout. Proper headers, tables, bullet points, and formatting. All calculations are clearly presented and documented. Very minor: could use consistent spacing in table (line 95)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,,"Average of individual correctness scores: (95 + 98) / 2 = 96.5, rounded to 97"

Recommendations,Recommendation,Cost_Estimation_Agent,,"Lines 16-35","Consider adding more detailed breakdown of effort estimation methodology and include summary table for better readability. The concise format is valuable but could benefit from additional context."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Migration_Analysis_Agent,,"Lines 1-120","Excellent comprehensive analysis. Consider standardizing DBU assumptions with other estimates and ensure consistency in effort range presentation (32-44 hours vs specific values)."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"All lines","Both outputs provide valuable perspectives - Cost_Estimation_Agent offers quick reference format while Migration_Analysis_Agent provides detailed documentation. Consider combining approaches for optimal stakeholder communication."
