Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two PySpark pipeline implementations for XML to BigQuery data ingestion were compared. Agent_1_Output provides a comprehensive single-table approach with extensive error handling and validation, while Agent_2_Output offers a multi-table normalized approach with modular transformations. Both are syntactically correct and functionally viable, with Agent_1_Output scoring higher on semantic alignment due to more complete implementation details, while Agent_2_Output excels in structural modularity for complex data models."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,78,N/A,"Both outputs address XML to BigQuery data pipeline creation but with different scopes. Agent_1_Output focuses on single-table ingestion with comprehensive member data mapping (lines 20-32), while Agent_2_Output implements multi-table normalization with Person, ContactInfo, and Language tables (lines 28-46). Both use similar PySpark patterns and BigQuery integration, but Agent_2_Output assumes more complex XML structure with nested elements. The core intent is aligned but implementation scope differs significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure: imports, configuration, helper functions, and main pipeline. Agent_1_Output uses a more linear approach with functions like initialize_spark_session (line 35), read_xml_data (line 46), transform_data (line 56), and write_to_bigquery (line 108). Agent_2_Output employs more modular design with separate transformation functions for each table (lines 65-95) and schema validation (lines 97-106). Both include BigQuery table existence checks and error handling, but Agent_2_Output has better separation of concerns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,N/A,"Syntax is valid with proper imports, function definitions, and PySpark operations. Minor issues: line 41 uses legacy time parser config which may cause warnings, and line 89 has potential null handling that could be more robust. All variables are properly defined and BigQuery integration follows correct patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,92,N/A,"Syntax is valid with proper imports and function definitions. Issues identified: line 60 uses undefined XML reading format 'com.databricks.spark.xml' without proper package configuration in SparkSession builder (missing .config('spark.jars.packages')), and line 113 has potential schema access issue with schema[field].dataType syntax. Otherwise well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,N/A,"Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 93. Both outputs are syntactically sound with minor issues that don't prevent execution but could cause runtime warnings or require additional configuration."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,N/A,N/A,"Consider adding multi-table support for normalized data models and improve null handling in transform_data function (line 89). The comprehensive error handling and validation approach is excellent and should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,N/A,N/A,"Add proper Databricks XML package configuration to SparkSession builder (line 23) and fix schema field access pattern in validate_schema function (line 113). The modular design is well-architected for complex data transformations."
