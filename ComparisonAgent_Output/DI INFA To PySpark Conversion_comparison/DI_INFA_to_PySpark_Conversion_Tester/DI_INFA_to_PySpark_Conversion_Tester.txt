# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Informatica to PySpark transformation with test cases. Agent 1 provides more detailed test coverage (10 vs 8 test cases) and more precise technical specifications. Agent 2 includes additional performance optimization recommendations and cost estimation. Overall semantic alignment is strong with minor structural and implementation differences.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective: documenting Informatica ETL to PySpark transformation for PS_VENDOR table. Key semantic alignments include:

- Expression transformation mapping from $$Audit_Year to lit(2019) and SESSSTARTTIME to current_timestamp/current_date
- Null handling with '*' as nullValue option  
- Data type mappings from Informatica to PySpark types
- Test case coverage for happy path, null handling, empty datasets, and error scenarios

**Minor semantic differences:** Agent 2 uses current_date() vs Agent 1's current_timestamp() for LOAD_DT field (lines 15-16 vs 12-13).

### Structural Similarity (Score: 82/100)

Both outputs follow similar structural organization:
1. Transformation Change Detection section
2. Recommended Manual Interventions  
3. Test Case Generation with numbered test cases
4. Pytest Script implementation

**Key structural differences:**
- Agent 1 uses TC_001-TC_010 numbering (lines 45-85) while Agent 2 uses TC01-TC08 (lines 47-75)
- Agent 1 has more granular test case breakdown with 10 cases vs Agent 2's 8 cases
- Agent 2 includes additional performance optimization section (lines 25-35) and API cost estimation (lines 280-285) not present in Agent 1

### Correctness

**Agent 1 (Score: 92/100):** Demonstrates high syntactic correctness with valid Python/PySpark syntax throughout pytest scripts, proper schema definitions, correct pytest fixture usage, and valid assertion statements. Minor issue at line 180 with potential schema mismatch in test_TC_004.

**Agent 2 (Score: 89/100):** Shows good syntactic correctness with valid Python/PySpark syntax and proper pandas integration. Issues identified at line 165 (invalid data type handling), line 195 (incomplete schema definition), and line 240 (pandas import verification).

**Overall Correctness: 91/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Structural Similarity | 82 | 82 | 82 |
| Correctness | 92 | 89 | 91 |
| **Overall** | **87** | **86** | **87** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent 1:** 
- Strengths: Comprehensive test coverage with 10 detailed test cases covering edge cases like extra columns (TC_010) and overwrite mode validation (TC_007)
- Recommendations: Consider adding performance optimization guidance similar to Agent 2, include cost estimation for completeness

**For Agent 2:**
- Strengths: Includes valuable performance optimization recommendations (repartition, cache) and API cost estimation with good pandas integration
- Recommendations: Expand test case coverage to match Agent 1's comprehensiveness, fix potential schema validation issues in test cases TC05 and TC06, ensure proper pandas import handling
