Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,85,All,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Informatica to PySpark transformation with test cases. Agent 1 provides more detailed test coverage (10 vs 8 test cases) and more precise technical specifications. Agent 2 includes additional performance optimization recommendations and cost estimation. Overall semantic alignment is strong with minor structural and implementation differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,1-200,"Both outputs address the same core objective: documenting Informatica ETL to PySpark transformation for PS_VENDOR table. Key semantic alignments include: (1) Expression transformation mapping from $$Audit_Year to lit(2019) and SESSSTARTTIME to current_timestamp/current_date, (2) Null handling with '*' as nullValue option, (3) Data type mappings from Informatica to PySpark types, (4) Test case coverage for happy path, null handling, empty datasets, and error scenarios. Minor semantic differences: Agent 2 uses current_date() vs Agent 1's current_timestamp() for LOAD_DT field (lines 15-16 vs 12-13)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,1-300,"Both outputs follow similar structural organization: (1) Transformation Change Detection section, (2) Recommended Manual Interventions, (3) Test Case Generation with numbered test cases, (4) Pytest Script implementation. Key structural differences: Agent 1 uses TC_001-TC_010 numbering (lines 45-85) while Agent 2 uses TC01-TC08 (lines 47-75). Agent 1 has more granular test case breakdown with 10 cases vs Agent 2's 8 cases. Agent 2 includes additional performance optimization section (lines 25-35) and API cost estimation (lines 280-285) not present in Agent 1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,1-400,"Agent 1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness: (1) Valid Python/PySpark syntax throughout pytest scripts, (2) Proper schema definitions with StructType and StructField, (3) Correct pytest fixture usage with @pytest.fixture decorators, (4) Valid assertion statements and exception handling with pytest.raises(), (5) Consistent variable naming and function definitions. Minor issues: Line 180 has potential schema mismatch in test_TC_004 where bad_schema only defines SET_ID but transform_df expects all columns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,89,1-350,"Agent 2 shows good syntactic correctness: (1) Valid Python/PySpark syntax in pytest implementations, (2) Proper schema definitions and fixture usage, (3) Correct use of pandas integration with toPandas() method, (4) Valid assertion logic and exception handling. Issues identified: Line 165 in test_TC05 creates invalid data with string in integer field but schema validation may not catch this properly, Line 195 in test_TC06 has incomplete schema definition that may cause runtime issues, Line 240 uses pd.isnull() without proper pandas import verification."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,91,All,"Average correctness score of 90.5 rounded to 91. Both outputs demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with valid Python/PySpark code structures, proper pytest implementations, and appropriate exception handling patterns."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,95,45-85,"Strengths: Comprehensive test coverage with 10 detailed test cases covering edge cases like extra columns (TC_010) and overwrite mode validation (TC_007). Clear test case descriptions and expected outcomes. Recommendations: Consider adding performance optimization guidance similar to Agent_2, include cost estimation for completeness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,85,47-75,"Strengths: Includes valuable performance optimization recommendations (repartition, cache) and API cost estimation. Good use of pandas integration for test validation. Recommendations: Expand test case coverage to match Agent_1's comprehensiveness, fix potential schema validation issues in test cases TC05 and TC06, ensure proper pandas import handling."
