Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Informatica to PySpark ETL conversion with test cases. Output 1 focuses on vendor master data loading with audit year and timestamp enrichment, while Output 2 covers PS_VENDOR_S4 flat file processing for GCP Dataproc. Both include transformation change detection, manual interventions, and pytest scripts. Key differences include timestamp vs date handling (current_timestamp vs current_date), schema variations, and test case complexity. Overall semantic alignment is strong despite implementation variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,N/A,"Both outputs address the same fundamental task of documenting Informatica ETL to PySpark conversion for vendor data processing. They share identical core concepts: transformation change detection, manual interventions, test case generation, and pytest implementation. However, Output 1 uses current_timestamp() for LOAD_DT while Output 2 uses current_date(), and Output 1 includes API cost estimation (line 245-247) which Output 2 lacks. The semantic intent and business logic are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: numbered sections (1. Transformation Change Detection, 2. Recommended Manual Interventions, 3. Test Case Generation), subsection breakdowns with bullet points, test case listings with TC_XXX identifiers, and complete pytest scripts. The main structural difference is Output 1 includes an API Cost Estimation section (lines 245-247) that Output 2 omits. Otherwise, the logical flow and decomposition approach are virtually identical."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 1,95,"Lines 89, 156, 174","Output 1 has minor syntax inconsistencies: Line 89 uses 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' instead of 'report', line 156 has inconsistent string handling in test data, and line 174 shows potential schema mismatch in test setup. The pytest code is otherwise syntactically correct with proper imports, fixtures, and test structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output 2,88,"Lines 45, 78, 156, 203","Output 2 has several syntax issues: Line 45 shows inconsistent date type casting (DateType vs StringType in schema), line 78 has potential delimiter mismatch ('||' mentioned but not used), line 156 contains incomplete schema definition in test_TC06_missing_column, and line 203 has pandas integration issues with null checking. These affect code executability."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,N/A,"Average correctness score across both outputs. Output 1 demonstrates better syntax consistency and completeness, while Output 2 has more technical inconsistencies that could impact execution. Both outputs maintain good overall structure and logical flow despite syntax issues."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 1,N/A,"Lines 89, 156","Fix terminology inconsistency on line 89 ('ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' should be 'report'). Validate test data consistency in line 156 to ensure proper schema alignment. Consider adding more detailed error handling examples."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output 2,N/A,"Lines 45, 78, 156, 203","Resolve data type inconsistency between schema definition and casting operations on line 45. Clarify delimiter usage mentioned on line 78. Complete the schema definition in test_TC06_missing_column on line 156. Fix pandas null checking logic on line 203 to use proper pandas methods."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardizing timestamp vs date handling approach, 2) Adding more comprehensive error scenarios in test cases, 3) Including performance benchmarking tests, 4) Adding data quality validation checks, 5) Implementing logging and monitoring examples for production deployment."
