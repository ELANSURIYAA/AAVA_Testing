Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive pytest scripts for PS_VENDOR ETL validation with similar core functionality but different implementation approaches. Agent 1 provides more granular test coverage with 10 test cases versus Agent 2's 8 test cases. Both scripts validate data transformation, schema handling, and error conditions effectively."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,,"Both outputs address the same core objective of validating PS_VENDOR PySpark ETL logic. They test similar scenarios including happy path validation, null handling, empty datasets, schema validation, and data type errors. However, Agent 1 focuses more on specific ETL workflow aspects (overwrite mode, audit year override) while Agent 2 emphasizes boundary value testing and pandas integration. The semantic intent is highly aligned with minor differences in test scope and emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,,"Both scripts follow pytest conventions with similar fixture patterns and test function structures. Agent 1 uses a more modular approach with separate utility functions (transform_df, make_input_df) while Agent 2 integrates transformation logic within the apply_transformations function. Agent 1 has 10 test functions versus Agent 2's 8, with Agent 1 including additional tests for overwrite mode (TC_007) and extra column handling (TC_010). The overall flow and organization are comparable but with notable structural differences in function organization and test coverage scope."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 45-47, 89-91, 134-136","Agent 1 demonstrates strong syntactic correctness with proper pytest structure, valid PySpark operations, and correct schema definitions. Minor issues include inconsistent timestamp handling (current_timestamp vs string) in lines 45-47 and potential schema mismatch in test_TC_005 where string AUD_YR_NBR is tested against integer schema. The transform_df function is well-structured and the test logic is sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 52-54, 78-80, 112-114","Agent 2 shows good syntactic correctness with proper pytest fixtures and PySpark operations. Issues include inconsistent date handling (current_date vs DateType casting) in lines 52-54, and the apply_transformations function has redundant casting operations that could cause performance issues. The schema fixture approach is cleaner but the transformation logic is more verbose than necessary."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Both scripts demonstrate strong syntactic correctness with valid Python, pytest, and PySpark syntax. Minor issues exist in both related to data type handling and casting operations, but these don't prevent execution. Both scripts would run successfully with proper PySpark environment setup."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider standardizing timestamp handling approach (lines 45-47) and review schema validation logic in test_TC_005 for consistency. The modular function approach is excellent and should be maintained."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Optimize the apply_transformations function to reduce redundant casting operations (lines 52-80) and consider adding test cases for overwrite mode and extra column handling to match Agent 1's coverage. The schema fixture pattern is well-implemented."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Standardized error handling patterns, 2) Consistent data type handling approaches, 3) Additional integration tests for end-to-end ETL validation, 4) Performance benchmarking tests for large datasets, 5) Documentation of expected runtime environments and dependencies."
