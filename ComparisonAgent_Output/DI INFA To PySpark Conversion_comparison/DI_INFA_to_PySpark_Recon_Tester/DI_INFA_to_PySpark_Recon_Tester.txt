# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents deliver comprehensive Python scripts for Informatica to PySpark migration validation of PS_VENDOR table. **Agent_1_Migration_Validator** provides more robust error handling and detailed logging with dual handlers (console + file), while **Agent_2_Migration_Validator** offers cleaner code organization and better performance optimization with explicit caching and repartitioning. Key differences include logging approaches (Agent_1: dual handlers vs Agent_2: file-only), data comparison methods (Agent_1: DataFrame operations vs Agent_2: cell-by-cell), and authentication patterns (Agent_1: environment checks vs Agent_2: explicit validation functions). Both maintain security through environment variables and follow similar 12-step workflows.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both scripts address identical core objectives: PS_VENDOR migration validation with data extraction, transformation, transfer, comparison, and reconciliation reporting. They implement similar transformation logic (AUD_YR_NBR=2019, LOAD_DT updates) and schema handling. Minor semantic differences include Agent_1's focus on API cost tracking ($0.02) versus Agent_2's emphasis on performance optimization. Agent_1 uses `current_timestamp()` while Agent_2 uses `current_date()` for LOAD_DT, representing slight semantic variation in timestamp handling approach.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both follow identical 12-step structural framework with similar function organization and workflow phases. Agent_1 structures functions more linearly while Agent_2 groups related functions with better separation of concerns. Key structural differences: Agent_1 implements comparison via DataFrame operations (lines 180-220) while Agent_2 uses nested loops for cell-by-cell comparison (lines 200-240). Agent_1 has more comprehensive error handling blocks throughout, while Agent_2 concentrates error handling in main execution. Both maintain similar import structures and configuration sections.

### Correctness

**Agent_1_Migration_Validator (Score: 92/100)**
Minor syntax issues identified at lines 15-20 (logging configuration uses both StreamHandler and FileHandler correctly), line 45 (environment variable handling is robust), and line 180 (DataFrame comparison logic is syntactically sound but could have more explicit null handling). All imports are properly defined, variable scoping is consistent, and function definitions are complete. The script demonstrates good Python practices with proper exception handling and logging integration.

**Agent_2_Migration_Validator (Score: 88/100)**
Several minor syntax considerations at lines 12-16 (logging configuration is simpler but lacks console output), line 85 (authentication functions are well-structured), and lines 200-240 (nested loop comparison logic is syntactically correct but computationally intensive for large datasets). All imports are valid, variable definitions are consistent, and function structures are complete. Minor improvement needed in error message formatting and some variable name consistency.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Agent_1_Migration_Validator | Agent_2_Migration_Validator | Overall |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Correctness | 92 | 88 | 90 |
| **Overall** | **85** | **84** | **84** |

## Recommendations

**For Agent_1_Migration_Validator:**
Enhance DataFrame comparison logic (lines 180-220) with more explicit null value handling and add performance optimization for large datasets. Consider adding data type validation checks and implementing parallel processing for comparison operations. The dual logging approach is excellent - maintain this pattern.

**For Agent_2_Migration_Validator:**
Replace cell-by-cell comparison (lines 200-240) with vectorized operations for better performance on large datasets. Add console logging handler (lines 12-16) to complement file logging for better debugging. Consider implementing the API cost tracking feature present in Agent_1. The authentication validation functions are well-designed - expand this pattern to other connection components.
