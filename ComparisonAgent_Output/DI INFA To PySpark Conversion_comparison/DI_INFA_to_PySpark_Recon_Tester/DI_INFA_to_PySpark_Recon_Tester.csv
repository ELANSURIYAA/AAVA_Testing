Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-400+","Both scripts provide comprehensive Python solutions for Informatica to PySpark migration validation of PS_VENDOR table. They share nearly identical semantic intent and structural organization with 12-step workflows covering data extraction, transformation, comparison, and reconciliation reporting. Key differences include logging implementation approaches, authentication methods, and specific transformation logic details. Overall assessment shows high compatibility with strong semantic and structural alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 300-350","Both scripts address identical migration validation goals for PS_VENDOR table with similar schema definitions and transformation logic. Script_1 uses more detailed API cost tracking and GCS integration while Script_2 focuses on comprehensive error handling and authentication. Minor differences in audit year handling (environment variable vs hardcoded) and timestamp functions (current_timestamp vs current_date) reduce perfect semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-30, 50-100, 200-250","Excellent structural alignment with both following 12-step workflow organization. Both use similar function decomposition, configuration sections, and execution flow. Script_1 has more modular GCS operations while Script_2 has more integrated authentication functions. Main structural difference is in comparison logic implementation - Script_1 uses Spark DataFrame operations while Script_2 uses pandas conversion for detailed cell-by-cell comparison."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script_1,95,"Lines 15-20, 180-185","Valid Python syntax throughout with proper imports and function definitions. Minor issues: Line 180 has undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' used before assignment in some code paths. Line 15 environment variable handling could benefit from validation. Overall excellent syntax and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script_2,93,"Lines 25-30, 220-225","Valid Python syntax with comprehensive error handling. Minor issues: Line 225 potential division by zero in match percentage calculation if total_rows * total_cols equals zero. Line 30 missing import for json module used in generate_report function. Authentication functions reference undefined variables in some scenarios."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Both scripts demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper Python structure, imports, and function definitions. Minor variable scoping and error handling improvements needed in both. Average correctness score reflects strong technical implementation with room for minor refinements."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Script_1,,"Lines 180, 15","Address undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' usage and add environment variable validation for robust error handling."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Script_2,,"Lines 225, 30","Add zero division protection in match percentage calculation and include missing json import for complete functionality."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Lines 1-400+","Consider standardizing authentication approaches and timestamp functions for better consistency. Both scripts would benefit from unified error handling patterns and configuration management."
