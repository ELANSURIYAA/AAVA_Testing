Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts are comprehensive Python implementations for Informatica to PySpark migration validation of PS_VENDOR table. They share identical semantic intent and overall architectural approach, with 95% structural similarity. Key differences lie in implementation details: Script1 uses dual logging handlers and tempfile operations, while Script2 uses single file logging and direct file operations. Both scripts are syntactically correct with proper error handling, authentication, and security practices. The scripts demonstrate equivalent functionality for ETL validation, data comparison, and reconciliation reporting."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,N/A,"Both scripts address identical migration validation goals with the same core transformations, data flow, and business logic. Minor semantic differences in variable naming (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt vs report) and timestamp functions (current_timestamp vs current_date) do not affect overall intent. Both implement the same 12-step validation process with equivalent error handling and security measures."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,90,N/A,"Scripts follow nearly identical structural organization with same function decomposition and execution flow. Both use identical main() function structure, same configuration sections, and equivalent step-by-step approach. Key structural differences: Script1 has more modular utility functions (lines 95-105), while Script2 has more integrated approach (lines 85-95). Both maintain consistent error handling patterns and logging throughout."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script1,98,"Lines 15-25, 45, 180","Minor issues: Line 15 imports tempfile but never uses it. Line 45 has undefined variable 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' in function signature that should be 'report'. Line 180 references undefined 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt_dict' parameter. All other syntax is valid with proper imports, function definitions, and control structures."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Script2,100,N/A,"Syntactically perfect with all imports used, variables properly defined, function signatures correct, and no undefined references. All Python syntax is valid, imports are utilized, and control structures are properly formed."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Average of individual scores: (98 + 100) / 2 = 99. Both scripts demonstrate high syntactic quality with only minor issues in Script1."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Script1,N/A,"Lines 15, 45, 180","Fix undefined variable references: Remove unused tempfile import (line 15), correct function parameter name from 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt' to 'report' (line 45), and fix undefined 'ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt_dict' parameter (line 180). Consider adopting Script2's cleaner variable naming conventions."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Script2,N/A,N/A,"Script is syntactically sound. Consider adopting Script1's dual logging handler approach for better log management and tempfile operations for safer file handling in production environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts would benefit from: 1) Consistent variable naming conventions across implementations, 2) Standardized error message formats, 3) Unified approach to timestamp handling (choose either current_timestamp or current_date), 4) Enhanced documentation for complex transformation logic, 5) Consider parameterizing hardcoded values like audit year and API costs."
