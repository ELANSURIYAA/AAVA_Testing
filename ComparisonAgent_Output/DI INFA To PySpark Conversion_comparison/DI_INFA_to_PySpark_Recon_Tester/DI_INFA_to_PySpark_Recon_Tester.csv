Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Two comprehensive Python scripts for Informatica to PySpark migration validation of PS_VENDOR table. Both implement 12-step validation workflows with data extraction, transformation, comparison, and reconciliation. Agent_1_Migration_Script uses more sophisticated error handling with multiple logging handlers and includes API cost tracking. Agent_2_Migration_Script has simpler logging setup but includes more detailed authentication functions. Semantic similarity is high (88/100) with same core purpose and workflow. Structural similarity is good (82/100) with similar function organization but different implementation approaches. Both scripts are syntactically correct (100/100) with proper imports and structure."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both scripts implement identical core functionality for PS_VENDOR migration validation with same 12-step workflow approach. Key semantic alignments: identical table schema definitions (lines 45-65 in both), same transformation logic with AUD_YR_NBR=2019 and LOAD_DT updates, identical comparison and reconciliation approaches. Minor semantic differences: Agent_1 includes API cost estimation ($0.02) while Agent_2 shows actual cost ($0.012), Agent_1 uses current_timestamp() while Agent_2 uses current_date() for LOAD_DT field, Agent_1 has more detailed GCS integration while Agent_2 focuses more on Databricks authentication."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both scripts follow identical 12-step structural organization with similar function decomposition. Structural alignments: same configuration section layout, identical schema definition structure, similar main() function flow, consistent error handling patterns. Key structural differences: Agent_1 uses dual logging handlers (StreamHandler + FileHandler, lines 15-22) while Agent_2 uses single file handler (lines 15-18), Agent_1 has more modular GCS functions while Agent_2 has integrated authentication functions, Agent_1 uses pandas+pyarrow for parquet conversion while Agent_2 uses direct pandas.to_parquet(), different variable naming conventions (ELANSURIYAA/AAVA_Testingrt vs report)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Migration_Script,100,N/A,"Script is syntactically correct with proper Python syntax, valid imports, correct function definitions, proper exception handling, and consistent variable usage. All imports are standard libraries or commonly used packages. Function signatures are properly defined with appropriate parameters and return types."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Migration_Script,100,N/A,"Script is syntactically correct with valid Python syntax, proper imports, correct function definitions, appropriate exception handling, and consistent variable usage. All imports are standard libraries. Function definitions are properly structured with correct parameter handling."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,N/A,"Both scripts demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with no syntax errors, proper import statements, well-defined functions, appropriate exception handling, and consistent coding practices. Both follow Python best practices for structure and organization."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Migration_Script,N/A,N/A,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive error handling and logging. Consider standardizing the LOAD_DT field type (timestamp vs date) for consistency with Agent_2. The API cost tracking feature is valuable and should be retained. Consider adding more detailed authentication functions similar to Agent_2."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Migration_Script,N/A,N/A,"Strong implementation with good authentication handling. Consider implementing dual logging handlers like Agent_1 for better log management. The simplified parquet conversion approach is efficient. Consider adding API cost tracking feature from Agent_1. Ensure LOAD_DT field type consistency across implementations."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both scripts provide robust migration validation solutions. Recommend creating a hybrid approach combining Agent_1's comprehensive logging and cost tracking with Agent_2's detailed authentication. Standardize LOAD_DT field handling and consider implementing unified error reporting format. Both scripts would benefit from additional unit tests and configuration validation."
