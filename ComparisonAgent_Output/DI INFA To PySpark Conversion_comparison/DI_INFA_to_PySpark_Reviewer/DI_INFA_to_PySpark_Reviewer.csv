Section,Aspect,Agent,Score,Line_References,Details
Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,Lines 1-200,"Both reports provide comprehensive reviews of Informatica to PySpark migration for PS_VENDOR workflow. Report_1 focuses on conversion accuracy and technical details with 8 structured sections, while Report_2 emphasizes functionality assessment and performance with 7 sections. Both conclude the migration is highly successful with ratings of 9/10 and 9.5/10 respectively."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,Lines 1-50,"Both reports address identical core objectives: reviewing Informatica PS_VENDOR workflow migration to PySpark. Key semantic alignments include: data source analysis (profrec_vendor.txt), transformation logic (AUD_YR_NBR and LOAD_DT), null handling, and Delta Lake output. Minor semantic differences in emphasis: Report_1 focuses more on conversion accuracy while Report_2 emphasizes performance and scalability."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,Lines 1-200,"Both follow numbered section structure but differ in organization. Report_1 uses 8 sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, Rating, API Cost) while Report_2 uses 7 sections (Overview, Functionality, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Recommendations, Conclusion). Similar logical flow but different decomposition approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_1,98,Lines 1-100,"Report_1 is syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent terminology, and accurate technical references. Minor issue: workflow name inconsistency between 'wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor' and 'm_aufi016d_PS_Vendor' in different sections."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Report_2,99,Lines 1-100,"Report_2 is syntactically correct with excellent formatting, consistent workflow naming 'm_aufi016d_PS_Vendor' throughout, proper technical terminology, and well-structured content organization."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,N/A,"Both reports demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and technical accuracy. Average score reflects minor naming inconsistency in Report_1."
