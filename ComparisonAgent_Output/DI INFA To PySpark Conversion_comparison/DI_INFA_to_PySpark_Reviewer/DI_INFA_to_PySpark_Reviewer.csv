Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Informatica to PySpark migration for PS_VENDOR workflow. Agent_1 focuses on wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor while Agent_2 reviews m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor. Both conclude highly successful migrations (9/10 vs 9.5/10 ratings) with similar technical assessments, transformation mappings, and optimization recommendations. Key alignment areas include data flow accuracy, null handling, schema mapping, and performance considerations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical migration review objectives with highly aligned technical assessments. Core functional areas covered identically: data sources/destinations (flat file to Delta table), transformations (AUD_YR_NBR and LOAD_DT), null handling (asterisk to None), schema mapping, error handling, and performance optimization. Conclusions are nearly identical with both rating migration success at 9+ out of 10. Minor semantic differences in workflow naming (wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor vs m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor) and cost reporting ($0.02 vs $0.012) but overall intent and technical analysis are highly consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both follow similar structured report formats with numbered sections. Agent_1 uses 8 sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, Rating, API Cost) while Agent_2 uses 7 sections (Overview, Functionality, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Recommendations, Conclusion). Logical flow is nearly identical: introduction -> technical analysis -> performance -> recommendations -> conclusion. Agent_2 includes additional subsections for scalability and testing results. Both use consistent formatting with bullet points, technical details, and structured recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,Lines 15-16,"Minor inconsistency in workflow name reference - uses both 'wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor' and 'PS_VENDOR' interchangeably. Otherwise syntactically correct with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and well-structured content."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,100,,"Syntactically correct with consistent formatting, proper section numbering, accurate technical references, and no formatting or structural issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,99,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting and structure. Agent_1 has minor workflow naming inconsistency while Agent_2 maintains perfect consistency throughout."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Consider standardizing workflow naming conventions throughout the report. Maintain consistent reference to either full workflow name or abbreviated form. Otherwise excellent technical depth and comprehensive coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Excellent consistency and structure maintained throughout. Consider adding API cost breakdown for transparency. Strong technical analysis with comprehensive testing coverage."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide excellent migration review quality. Recommend standardizing report templates to ensure consistent section organization and technical coverage depth across similar migration assessments."
