Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive reviews of Informatica to PySpark migration for PS_VENDOR workflow. First_Report focuses on technical accuracy and migration fidelity with detailed conversion mapping. Second_Report emphasizes broader aspects including performance scalability and code quality. Both conclude with high migration success ratings (9/10 and 9.5/10 respectively) and similar optimization recommendations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (First_Report) Lines 1-45 (Second_Report)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: reviewing Informatica to PySpark migration accuracy identifying discrepancies and providing recommendations. Content overlap includes conversion accuracy assessment transformation logic validation error handling evaluation and optimization suggestions. Semantic alignment is strong with 88% similarity. Minor divergence in emphasis: First_Report focuses more on technical mapping accuracy while Second_Report emphasizes performance and scalability aspects."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-8 sections (First_Report) Lines 1-7 sections (Second_Report)","Both follow structured report format with numbered sections and logical flow. First_Report uses 8 sections: Summary Conversion Accuracy Discrepancies Optimization Assessment Recommendations Rating API Cost. Second_Report uses 7 sections: Overview Functionality Performance Code Quality Testing Recommendations Conclusion. Structural similarity is 75% due to different section organization and flow though both cover similar content domains."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,First_Report,95,"Lines 15 25 35","Well-formed documentation with consistent formatting proper section numbering accurate technical references. Minor issues: Line 15 has inconsistent spacing in bullet points Line 25 could benefit from more specific line references in recommendations Line 35 has minor formatting inconsistency in the rating section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Second_Report,97,"Lines 10 30","Excellent documentation structure with consistent formatting proper technical terminology and comprehensive coverage. Very minor issues: Line 10 has slight inconsistency in bullet point formatting Line 30 could have more specific technical details in performance section."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper documentation structure consistent formatting and accurate technical content. Average correctness score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies but overall excellent quality."
