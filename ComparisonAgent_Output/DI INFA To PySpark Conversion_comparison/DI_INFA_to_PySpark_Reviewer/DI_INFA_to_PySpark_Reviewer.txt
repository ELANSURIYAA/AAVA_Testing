# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both reports provide comprehensive reviews of Informatica to PySpark migration for PS_VENDOR workflow. Report_1 focuses on conversion accuracy and technical details with 8 structured sections, while Report_2 emphasizes functionality assessment and performance with 7 sections. Both conclude the migration is highly successful with ratings of 9/10 and 9.5/10 respectively.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 92/100)

Both reports address identical core objectives: reviewing Informatica PS_VENDOR workflow migration to PySpark. Key semantic alignments include:
- Data source analysis (profrec_vendor.txt)
- Transformation logic (AUD_YR_NBR and LOAD_DT)
- Null handling strategies
- Delta Lake output implementation

Minor semantic differences exist in emphasis: Report_1 focuses more on conversion accuracy while Report_2 emphasizes performance and scalability considerations.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both follow numbered section structure but differ in organization:
- **Report_1**: 8 sections (Summary, Conversion Accuracy, Discrepancies, Optimization, Assessment, Recommendations, Rating, API Cost)
- **Report_2**: 7 sections (Overview, Functionality, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Recommendations, Conclusion)

Similar logical flow but different decomposition approaches affect structural alignment.

### Correctness

- **Report_1**: 98/100 - Syntactically correct with proper formatting and accurate technical references. Minor workflow name inconsistency between 'wkf_m_aufi016d_PS_Vendor' and 'm_aufi016d_PS_Vendor'
- **Report_2**: 99/100 - Excellent syntactic correctness with consistent workflow naming and well-structured organization
- **Overall**: 99/100

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Report_1 | Report_2 | Overall |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 92 | 92 | 92 |
| Structural Similarity | 78 | 78 | 78 |
| Correctness | 98 | 99 | 99 |
| **Overall** | **89** | **90** | **90** |

## Recommendations

### For Report_1
- Strengthen workflow name consistency throughout the document
- Consider standardizing section organization for future reports

### For Report_2
- Excellent structure and consistency maintained
- Consider adding more detailed API cost breakdown as shown in Report_1

### Combined Recommendations
Both reports are high-quality with complementary strengths. Report_1 provides detailed conversion accuracy focus while Report_2 offers comprehensive performance analysis. Consider combining structural approaches for future migration reviews.
