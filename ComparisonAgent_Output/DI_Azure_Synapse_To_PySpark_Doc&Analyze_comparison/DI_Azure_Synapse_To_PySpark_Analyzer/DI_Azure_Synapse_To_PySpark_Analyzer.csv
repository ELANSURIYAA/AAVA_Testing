Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents provide comprehensive analysis of the Azure Synapse stored procedure LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY. DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation delivers a general analysis focused on complexity metrics and optimization, while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer provides migration-specific guidance for PySpark conversion. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical understanding with nearly identical structural approaches and semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address the same stored procedure with very similar understanding of purpose and functionality. DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation focuses on general analysis and executive reporting context, while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer emphasizes migration mapping to Databricks. Core business logic understanding is identical, with minor differences in emphasis and migration-specific details."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-100 (both outputs)","Both outputs follow nearly identical structural organization: 1) Procedure Overview, 2) Complexity Metrics (with identical table format), 3) Syntax Differences, 4) Manual Adjustments, 5) Optimization Techniques. Section ordering and logical flow are consistent. Minor differences in subsection emphasis and migration-specific content in DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,95,"Line 25, Line 45","Well-formatted document with consistent internal structure. Minor inconsistency: Complexity Score shows 30 in text but references matching DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation score without clear baseline. All other syntax, formatting, and references are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,97,"Line 30","Excellent formatting and structure throughout. Minor inconsistency: Complexity Score shows 25 and references matching DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation score, but the referenced document shows 30. All other syntax, references, and formatting are correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper formatting, consistent internal references, and valid document structure. Minor scoring reference inconsistencies noted but do not impact overall quality."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,,"Resolve complexity score reference inconsistency (shows 30 but claims to match another document). Consider adding more specific line-by-line code analysis for enhanced technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,,"Correct complexity score reference inconsistency (claims to match document showing 30 but shows 25). Excellent migration focus - maintain this specialized approach for conversion projects."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology and cross-referencing approach. DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer's migration focus complements DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation's general analysis well - both serve distinct but valuable purposes."
