Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the Azure Synapse stored procedure LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY for PySpark migration. DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation scores complexity at 30 while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer scores it at 25. Both identify identical technical components: 1 source table, 4 dimension joins, 1 business rule transformation, and recommend refactoring approach. Content alignment is exceptionally high with minor differences in presentation and emphasis."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address identical migration analysis objectives with same stored procedure, source/target tables, dimension joins, and business rules. Minor scoring difference (30 vs 25 complexity) and slight emphasis variations on audit logging details. Core technical analysis and recommendations are semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both follow similar 5-section structure: Overview, Complexity Metrics, Syntax Differences, Manual Adjustments, Optimization Techniques. DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation uses more detailed subsection headers while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer uses numbered sections. Both employ tabular complexity metrics format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,100,,"Well-formed documentation with consistent internal references, accurate technical details, proper markdown formatting, and no syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,100,,"Well-formed documentation with consistent internal references, accurate technical details, proper markdown formatting, and no syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with no formatting errors, broken references, or internal inconsistencies."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,,"Excellent technical analysis with comprehensive coverage. Consider standardizing complexity scoring methodology to align with other analysis outputs."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,,"Strong technical analysis with clear migration guidance. Consider expanding on audit logging implementation details for better practitioner guidance."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs provide high-quality migration analysis suitable for technical teams. Minor alignment on complexity scoring and expanded implementation details would enhance consistency and practical value."
