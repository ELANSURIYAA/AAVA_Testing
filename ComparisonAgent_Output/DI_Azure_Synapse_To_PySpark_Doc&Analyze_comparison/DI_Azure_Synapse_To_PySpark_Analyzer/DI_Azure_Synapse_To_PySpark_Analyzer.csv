Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of Azure Synapse stored procedure LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY for PySpark migration. DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation focuses on technical complexity metrics and transformation requirements, while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer provides more detailed migration-specific guidance. Both outputs cover procedure overview, complexity analysis, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques with high semantic alignment but notable structural and scoring differences."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,88,N/A,"Both outputs address the same core objective: analyzing Azure Synapse stored procedure for PySpark migration. They cover identical key areas (procedure overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, optimization). Minor semantic differences include DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation emphasizing 'executive reporting and analytics' while DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer focuses on 'executive dashboards, regulatory reporting, and downstream analytics'. Both identify the same business rules, transformations, and technical requirements."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,82,N/A,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 5-section structure: 1) Procedure Overview, 2) Complexity Metrics, 3) Syntax Differences, 4) Manual Adjustments, 5) Optimization Techniques. Key structural differences: DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation uses more detailed complexity table with 15 metrics vs 12 in DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer. Section ordering and logical flow are identical. Both use tabular format for complexity metrics and bullet points for technical details."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,95,Lines 15-16,"Minor inconsistency in complexity score reporting: states 'Complexity Score (0–100): 30 (matches DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation Complexity Score)' which appears to be self-referential. All other technical content is syntactically correct with proper formatting and valid technical references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,98,N/A,"Syntactically correct throughout with consistent formatting, proper table structure, and accurate technical references. No syntax errors or formatting issues detected. All code references and technical terminology are properly formatted."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,N/A,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper document structure, formatting, and technical accuracy. Only minor self-referential inconsistency in DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation complexity score description."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation,N/A,Lines 15-16,"Fix self-referential complexity score description. Consider adding more migration-specific guidance similar to DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer's approach to audit logging and error handling details."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer,N/A,N/A,"Excellent migration analysis with comprehensive technical details. Consider adding more detailed complexity metrics table similar to DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation for enhanced technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both outputs provide strong foundation for Synapse to PySpark migration. Recommend combining the detailed complexity metrics from DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation with the migration-specific guidance from DI_Azure_Synapse_To_PySpark_Analyzer for optimal migration documentation."
