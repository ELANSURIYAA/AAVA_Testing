Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analyses of the Azure Synapse LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure for PySpark migration. Output_1 focuses on executive analytics and reporting context, while Output_2 emphasizes migration mapping and conversion specifics. Both achieve high semantic alignment (92/100) with identical structural organization (95/100) and excellent syntactic correctness (98/100 average). Key differences include complexity scoring (30 vs 25), API cost reporting ($0.005 vs $0.007), and depth of migration-specific guidance."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,"Lines 1-15, 45-60, 80-95","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY for Databricks migration. Output_1 emphasizes executive analytics context and business objectives, while Output_2 focuses on technical migration mapping. Both cover the same procedure functionality, data sources (STG_HOLDING_METRICS), dimension joins (4 tables), and business rules (income_amount validation). Minor semantic differences in emphasis and context presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-5, 20-25, 40-45, 65-70, 85-90","Nearly identical 5-section structure: (1) Procedure Overview, (2) Complexity Metrics, (3) Syntax Differences, (4) Manual Adjustments, (5) Optimization Techniques. Both use consistent subsection organization, bullet points, and table formatting. Output_2 includes additional migration-specific subsections and more detailed technical mappings. Flow and logical decomposition are essentially equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_1,98,"Lines 25-35, 50-55","Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent table structure, and valid internal references. Minor formatting inconsistency in complexity score presentation (matches DI_Azure_Synapse_Documentation reference). All technical terms, SQL syntax examples, and PySpark mappings are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Output_2,98,"Lines 30-40, 75-80","Excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and valid technical references. All SQL-to-PySpark syntax mappings are accurate. Complexity score presentation is clean and well-formatted. Minor inconsistency in API cost format presentation."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,,"Both outputs demonstrate excellent syntactic correctness with proper formatting, accurate technical content, and consistent internal structure. Average score reflects minor formatting variations but no significant syntax errors or broken references."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_1,,"Strengthen migration-specific technical guidance and provide more detailed PySpark code examples. Consider standardizing complexity score presentation format for consistency with referenced documentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Output_2,,"Enhance business context and executive analytics perspective to match comprehensive coverage. Standardize API cost reporting format and ensure consistency in technical terminology presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs are high-quality analyses suitable for migration planning. Consider merging the business context strength of Output_1 with the technical migration depth of Output_2 for optimal documentation. Standardize formatting conventions and complexity scoring methodology across both approaches."
