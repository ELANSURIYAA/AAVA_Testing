Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive analysis of the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure migration from Azure Synapse to PySpark. Agent_1 focuses on supporting executive analytics and reporting with complexity score of 30, while Agent_2 emphasizes migration mapping with complexity score of 25. Both cover identical core components: procedure overview, complexity metrics, syntax differences, manual adjustments, and optimization techniques. Key differences include complexity scoring methodology and specific implementation details for PySpark conversion."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs address the identical stored procedure (LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY) with same core intent: analyzing Azure Synapse to PySpark migration. Both identify same source table (STG_HOLDING_METRICS), same dimension tables (DIM_DATE, DIM_INSTITUTION, DIM_CORPORATION, DIM_PRODUCT), and same business logic (income_amount CASE statement). Minor differences in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on executive reporting context while Agent_2 emphasizes migration mapping specifics. Both reach same conclusions about refactoring approach and optimization strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Both outputs follow nearly identical 5-section structure: 1) Procedure Overview, 2) Complexity Metrics (with detailed tables), 3) Syntax Differences, 4) Manual Adjustments, 5) Optimization Techniques. Both use numbered sections, bullet points, and complexity metrics tables. Minor structural differences: Agent_1 uses more detailed table formatting in section 2 (lines 15-31), while Agent_2 has slightly different table structure (lines 20-35). Both conclude with API cost information and similar formatting patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,15-31,"Well-formed document with consistent formatting. Complexity metrics table properly structured. Minor issue: inconsistent spacing in some bullet points (lines 45-50). All internal references are valid and consistent."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,97,20-35,"Excellent document structure with consistent formatting throughout. Complexity metrics table well-organized. All internal references valid. Minor formatting inconsistency in one bullet point (line 78)."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,96,,"Both outputs demonstrate high syntactic correctness with proper document structure, valid internal references, and consistent formatting. Average score reflects minor formatting inconsistencies in both documents."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,,"Standardize table formatting in complexity metrics section (lines 15-31). Improve bullet point spacing consistency (lines 45-50). Consider adding more specific PySpark code examples for syntax differences section."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,,"Minor formatting adjustment needed in bullet point (line 78). Consider expanding on error handling implementation details in manual adjustments section. Excellent overall structure and content organization."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs provide excellent technical analysis with high semantic and structural similarity. Recommend: 1) Standardize complexity scoring methodology (Agent_1: 30, Agent_2: 25), 2) Align table formatting approaches, 3) Cross-reference API cost calculations for consistency, 4) Consider combining strengths - Agent_1's executive context with Agent_2's migration specifics."
