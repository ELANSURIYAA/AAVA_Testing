Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-95,"Both agents provide effort and cost estimation for Databricks PySpark conversion from Azure Synapse stored procedures. Agent_1_Output delivers comprehensive calculations with specific assumptions and detailed breakdowns, while Agent_2_Output acknowledges limitations due to missing environment details but provides thorough effort estimation. Key differences include Agent_1_Output's complete cost calculation ($0.135 USD runtime + $0.005 API = $0.140 total) versus Agent_2_Output's inability to calculate runtime costs, and varying effort estimates (8 hours vs 14-18 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-95,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Databricks PySpark conversion. Agent_1_Output provides specific runtime cost calculations ($0.135 USD) with detailed assumptions about cluster configuration and data volume (lines 8-20). Agent_2_Output acknowledges the same goal but cannot complete cost estimation due to missing environment details (lines 8-11). Both identify similar manual code fixes: temp table conversion, audit logging, business rule mapping, joins, error handling, and data type mapping. However, Agent_2_Output provides more detailed technical analysis of the conversion requirements (lines 15-25) while Agent_1_Output focuses on quantified estimates. The semantic intent is highly aligned despite different approaches to handling missing information."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-95,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with Cost Estimation and Code Fixing/Testing sections. Agent_1_Output uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1) with detailed calculation tables and effort breakdowns (lines 22-45, 65-85). Agent_2_Output uses similar numbering (2.1, 2.1) but includes explanatory notes about limitations (lines 8-11) and provides more narrative description of technical requirements (lines 15-30). Agent_1_Output presents data in structured tables while Agent_2_Output uses bullet points and descriptive paragraphs. Both conclude with API cost statements but Agent_1_Output provides comprehensive summary tables while Agent_2_Output ends with a limitation note. The logical flow is similar but presentation formats differ significantly."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,1-95,"Agent_1_Output demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. All calculations are mathematically sound (0.5 DBU x $0.27 = $0.135, lines 16-17). Tables are properly formatted with consistent headers and data alignment (lines 22-30, 65-85). Section numbering is consistent throughout. All references to components and costs are internally coherent. Minor formatting inconsistency in API cost presentation (separate line vs table integration, line 95) but does not affect overall correctness."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,90,1-95,"Agent_2_Output shows good internal consistency and proper formatting. Section numbering has minor inconsistency (two sections numbered 2.1, lines 8 and 13) which could cause confusion. Technical descriptions are accurate and well-structured. The limitation acknowledgment is professionally handled (lines 8-11). Effort estimates are presented clearly with proper categorization (lines 31-40). API cost format is consistent with professional documentation standards (line 45). The structural integrity is maintained despite the numbering issue."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,93,,"Average correctness score reflecting both outputs' strong internal consistency with minor formatting issues in Agent_2_Output's section numbering."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,22-30,"Excellent comprehensive approach with detailed calculations and assumptions. Consider adding more technical detail about the conversion process complexity as shown in Agent_2_Output. The structured table format enhances readability and professional presentation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,8-11,"Strong technical analysis and professional handling of limitations. Fix section numbering inconsistency (two 2.1 sections). Consider providing estimated ranges for cost calculations even when exact environment details are unavailable, similar to the effort estimation approach used."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-95,"Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized formatting conventions, 2) Cross-referencing between cost and effort estimates, 3) Risk assessment for the conversion process, 4) Timeline estimates alongside effort hours, 5) Validation criteria for the conversion success metrics."
