Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs address effort and cost estimation for Databricks PySpark conversion from Azure Synapse stored procedures. Agent_1_Output provides comprehensive cost calculations with detailed breakdowns ($0.135 USD runtime cost, 8 hours effort), while Agent_2_Output acknowledges limitations in cost estimation due to file parsing errors but provides similar effort estimates (14-18 hours). Semantic alignment is strong despite structural differences in completeness."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,,"Both outputs target the same core objective: estimating effort and cost for Databricks PySpark conversion of LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. Agent_1_Output provides complete analysis with specific cost calculations, while Agent_2_Output covers similar scope but acknowledges data access limitations. Both identify similar code fix requirements (temp tables, audit logging, joins, business rules) and testing needs (reconciliation, validation). The semantic intent and understanding are well-aligned despite execution differences."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with cost estimation and effort estimation sections. Agent_1_Output (lines 1-89) uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1) with detailed tables and calculations. Agent_2_Output (lines 1-45) uses similar numbering but with subsections (a, b) and bullet points. Agent_1_Output includes comprehensive summary tables while Agent_2_Output uses more descriptive paragraphs. Both conclude with API cost statements and totals."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1_Output,95,Lines 20-35,"Well-formatted document with proper table structures, consistent numbering, and complete calculations. Minor formatting inconsistency in summary table alignment but all syntax is valid and references are complete."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2_Output,88,Lines 8-12,"Proper document structure and formatting with valid syntax. Points deducted for acknowledged incomplete cost analysis due to file parsing error (lines 8-12) and less structured presentation of effort estimates compared to tabular format."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average of individual correctness scores. Both outputs maintain proper document syntax and internal consistency with Agent_1_Output being more complete and Agent_2_Output having acknowledged limitations."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1_Output,,Lines 1-89,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed cost breakdowns and structured effort estimation. Maintain the tabular format and detailed calculations approach. Consider adding risk factors or assumptions validation."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2_Output,,Lines 8-12,"Good effort estimation coverage but improve data access reliability to provide complete cost analysis. Consider implementing fallback estimation methods when environment details are unavailable. Enhance structure with tabular summaries like Agent_1_Output."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,,"Both outputs demonstrate strong understanding of PySpark conversion requirements. Agent_1_Output serves as the gold standard for completeness while Agent_2_Output shows good analytical approach despite technical limitations. Future implementations should ensure reliable access to environment configuration data for accurate cost modeling."
