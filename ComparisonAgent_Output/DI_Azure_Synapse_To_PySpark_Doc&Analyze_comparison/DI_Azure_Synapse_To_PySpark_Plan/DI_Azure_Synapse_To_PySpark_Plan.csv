Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-95,"Both agents provide effort and cost estimation for Databricks PySpark conversion from Azure Synapse stored procedures. Agent 1 delivers comprehensive calculations with specific pricing assumptions and detailed breakdowns, while Agent 2 acknowledges limitations due to file parsing errors but provides thorough effort estimation. Key differences include Agent 1's complete cost calculation ($0.135 USD per run) versus Agent 2's inability to provide runtime costs, and varying effort estimates (8 hours vs 14-18 hours)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,1-95,"Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and effort for Databricks PySpark conversion. They share similar understanding of required manual fixes (temp table conversion, audit logging, business rule mapping, joins, error handling, data type mapping) and testing requirements (reconciliation, validation, performance testing). The semantic alignment is strong despite different presentation styles and completeness levels."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,1-95,"Both outputs follow similar high-level structure with cost estimation and effort estimation sections. Agent 1 uses numbered sections (1.1, 2.1) with detailed tables and summary sections, while Agent 2 uses similar numbering (2.1, 2.1) but with different subsection organization. Both include effort breakdown tables and API cost tracking, though Agent 1 provides more granular component breakdowns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 1,95,1-60,"Agent 1 demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. All calculations are mathematically sound (0.5 DBU x $0.27 = $0.135), tables are properly formatted, effort estimates sum correctly (4.5 + 3.5 = 8 hours), and all references are consistent. Minor formatting inconsistencies in table alignment but no syntax errors or broken references."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent 2,88,61-95,"Agent 2 shows good structural consistency with proper section numbering and logical flow. However, contains some inconsistencies: section numbering starts at 2.1 instead of 1.1, and the inability to provide cost calculations due to file parsing errors represents a functional limitation rather than syntax error. Effort estimates are presented as ranges (6-8, 8-10, 14-18 hours) which is methodologically sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92,,"Average correctness score across both agents. Both outputs maintain good internal consistency and proper formatting, with Agent 1 providing more complete calculations and Agent 2 acknowledging limitations appropriately."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 1,,1-60,"Excellent comprehensive analysis with detailed cost breakdowns and specific assumptions. Maintain the granular approach to cost calculation and effort estimation. Consider adding uncertainty ranges for estimates to account for variability in actual implementation scenarios."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent 2,,61-95,"Good effort estimation methodology with appropriate acknowledgment of limitations. Address the file parsing issue that prevented cost calculation completion. Consider providing fallback estimation methods when primary data sources are unavailable. The range-based effort estimates (14-18 hours) show good uncertainty quantification."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-95,"Both agents should align on effort estimation methodology - Agent 1's 8-hour estimate versus Agent 2's 14-18 hours suggests different scope assumptions. Recommend standardizing the scope definition and estimation granularity. Both should include risk factors and assumption validation in future estimates."
