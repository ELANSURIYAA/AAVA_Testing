Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Azure Synapse LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical business logic and data flow descriptions. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with consistent section organization despite minor presentation differences. Both outputs achieve perfect correctness (100/100) with accurate syntax, proper formatting, and consistent internal references. The overall assessment shows excellent alignment between the two documentation approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All sections,"Both outputs describe identical stored procedure functionality with same business rules (income_amount transformation), identical data sources (STG_HOLDING_METRICS, dimension tables), same transformation logic, and identical target table (FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY). Minor differences in API cost reporting (0.005 vs 0.007 USD) and slight variations in complexity scoring (30 vs 25) do not affect core semantic meaning."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,Sections 1-7,"Both outputs follow consistent documentation structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Agent1 includes more detailed header formatting with task description block (lines 1-6). Agent2 has more concise header structure. Both use identical table structures for data mapping and complexity analysis. Section ordering and content organization are highly aligned."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent1,100,,"Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references are consistent. Table structures are properly formatted. No broken links or undefined references. Technical details are accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent2,100,,"Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references are consistent. Table structures are properly formatted. No broken links or undefined references. Technical details are accurate and well-structured."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, accurate table structures, and no formatting errors."
