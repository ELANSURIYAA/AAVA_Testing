Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,92,"Lines 1-200","Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY Azure Synapse stored procedure. Agent_1 presents a more structured approach with clear section headers and detailed complexity analysis, while Agent_2 offers similar content with slightly different organization. Both achieve the same fundamental goal of documenting the data loading process from staging to fact table with business rules and referential integrity checks."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,94,"Lines 1-50, 80-120","Both outputs describe identical business logic: loading FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY from STG_HOLDING_METRICS with dimension table joins and income_amount transformation. The core meaning and intent are virtually identical - both focus on data quality, referential integrity, and the same business rule for handling negative/null income amounts. Minor differences in emphasis on regulatory vs executive reporting do not affect core semantic alignment."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,"Lines 1-30, 60-90, 150-180","Both follow similar documentation structure with Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs sections. Agent_1 uses more formal section numbering (1-7) while Agent_2 uses hash-based markdown headers. The logical flow and information decomposition are nearly identical, with both presenting data mapping tables in the same format and covering the same analytical dimensions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,98,"Lines 45-55, 120-130","Agent_1 demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. The data mapping table is properly formatted with accurate column references. The complexity analysis provides specific metrics (Overall Complexity Score: 30). One minor inconsistency: references both #staging_metrics and STG_HOLDING_METRICS as source in different sections, but this reflects the actual SQL logic accurately."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,96,"Lines 40-50, 110-125","Agent_2 shows strong internal consistency with proper markdown formatting and accurate technical details. The data mapping table correctly identifies source tables and transformations. Complexity analysis is well-structured (Overall Complexity Score: 25). Minor inconsistency in API cost reporting (0.007 vs 0.005 USD) and slight variation in complexity scoring compared to Agent_1."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,97,"N/A","Both outputs demonstrate high correctness with accurate technical documentation, proper table formatting, and consistent internal references. Minor variations in complexity scores and API costs do not affect overall technical accuracy."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,N/A,"Lines 120-140","Agent_1 provides excellent comprehensive documentation with clear section numbering and detailed complexity metrics. Consider standardizing the source table references to avoid confusion between staging table names. The formal structure makes it highly suitable for enterprise documentation standards."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,N/A,"Lines 110-130","Agent_2 offers well-organized documentation with good markdown formatting. Consider aligning complexity scoring methodology with established standards and verify API cost calculations for consistency. The note about file read limitations adds valuable context about documentation scope."
