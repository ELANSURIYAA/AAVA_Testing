Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both Azure_Synapse_Documentation and Synapse_SQL_Documentation provide comprehensive documentation for the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. The outputs demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with nearly identical purpose and content coverage. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with both following numbered section formats, though with slight organizational differences. Both documents are syntactically correct (100/100 each) with proper formatting and consistent internal references. Overall assessment: 94/100 - Excellent alignment with minor structural variations."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,All Lines,"Both documents describe the identical stored procedure LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY with the same business purpose, data sources, transformations, and outputs. Key semantic alignments include: identical data lineage mapping, same business rules (income_amount transformation), identical complexity metrics, and consistent technical descriptions. Minor semantic differences: Azure_Synapse_Documentation uses 'executive reporting' while Synapse_SQL_Documentation uses 'regulatory reporting and executive dashboards' (lines 8-10), and slight variations in transformation descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,All Lines,"Both documents follow similar 7-section numbered structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Structural alignments include consistent section numbering, identical table formats for data mapping and complexity analysis, and similar subsection organization. Differences: Azure_Synapse_Documentation has more detailed header metadata (lines 1-7), different bullet point formatting in Component Structure section, and Azure_Synapse_Documentation includes API cost at end while Synapse_SQL_Documentation places it differently."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Azure_Synapse_Documentation,100,All Lines,"Document is syntactically correct with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, valid table structures, and no broken links or formatting errors. All section numbers are sequential, table headers align with content, and code snippets are properly formatted."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Azure_Synapse_Documentation,N/A,Lines 1-7,"Consider standardizing header metadata format to match organizational documentation standards. The detailed author/date/description block is comprehensive but could be streamlined."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Synapse_SQL_Documentation,N/A,Lines 8-10,"Consider expanding the overview section to include more context about regulatory vs executive reporting use cases to match the comprehensiveness of the comparison document."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,All Lines,"Both documents are high-quality and could serve as templates for similar stored procedure documentation. Consider establishing consistent API cost reporting location and format across documentation standards."
