# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the Azure Synapse LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY stored procedure. They demonstrate high semantic alignment (95/100) with identical business logic and data flow descriptions. Structural similarity is strong (88/100) with consistent section organization despite minor presentation differences. Both outputs achieve perfect correctness (100/100) with accurate syntax, proper formatting, and consistent internal references. The overall assessment shows excellent alignment between the two documentation approaches.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 95/100)

Both outputs describe identical stored procedure functionality with same business rules (income_amount transformation), identical data sources (STG_HOLDING_METRICS, dimension tables), same transformation logic, and identical target table (FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY). Minor differences in API cost reporting (0.005 vs 0.007 USD) and slight variations in complexity scoring (30 vs 25) do not affect core semantic meaning.

**Key Alignments:**
- Identical business logic for income_amount transformation
- Same data flow: STG_HOLDING_METRICS → temp table → dimension joins → FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY
- Consistent description of referential integrity enforcement
- Aligned data mapping tables with identical column mappings

### Structural Similarity (Score: 88/100)

Both outputs follow consistent documentation structure: Overview, Component Structure, Data Flow, Data Mapping, Transformation Logic, Complexity Analysis, and Key Outputs. Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent1 includes more detailed header formatting with task description block (lines 1-6). Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent2 has more concise header structure. Both use identical table structures for data mapping and complexity analysis. Section ordering and content organization are highly aligned.

**Structural Differences:**
- Header formatting approach (detailed vs concise)
- Minor variations in section introductions
- Consistent table structures and content organization

### Correctness

**Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent1: 100/100**
Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references are consistent. Table structures are properly formatted. No broken links or undefined references. Technical details are accurate and well-structured.

**Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent2: 100/100**
Perfect syntax and formatting. All internal references are consistent. Table structures are properly formatted. No broken links or undefined references. Technical details are accurate and well-structured.

**Overall Correctness: 100/100**
Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, accurate table structures, and no formatting errors.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent1 | Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent2 | Overall |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | 95 | 95 | 95 |
| Structural Similarity | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Overall** | **94** | **94** | **94** |

## Recommendations

**For Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent1:**
- Consider standardizing header format to match Agent2's more concise approach for consistency across documentation sets (lines 1-6)

**For Azure_Synapse_Doc_Agent2:**
- Consider aligning complexity scoring methodology with Agent1 (30 vs 25) to ensure consistent complexity assessments across similar procedures

**For Both Agents:**
- Standardize API cost reporting methodology to ensure consistent cost tracking across documentation generation processes
