- No files passed multi-gate matching; all comparisons marked "Not Comparable".
- All components in AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 are real, but no genuine one-to-one matches were detected.
- Strict input validation and multi-gate matching prevented false equivalence.
- Migration Impact is "High" for all components due to lack of comparable artifacts.
- Executive decision must consider missing equivalence and high migration risk.

---

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report compares three workflow output files from AAVA 1.0 against three from AAVA 2.0 using rigorous multi-gate validation. All files were physically present and extracted, but no valid one-to-one matches were found due to differences in business logic, data flow, and component structure. As a result, every comparison is marked "Not Comparable," and migration risk is high. No match percentages or dimension scores could be calculated, and no equivalence was established.

Note: 3 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- All files validated as real and extracted.
- No genuine matches detected after multi-gate analysis.
- High migration risk due to unmatched artifacts.
- Confidence level is low given incomplete comparison.
- Conditional recommendation: Migration not approved until equivalence is established.
- Business continuity cannot be assured without matched components.

- Comparison completeness is 0%; all files are not comparable.
- Unmatched files prevent reliable migration assessment.
- Only unmatched status is reported for all files.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line comparison is performed only for genuinely matched pairs passing all gates. Match percentage is calculated as (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100. Since no files were matched, no match percentages could be calculated.

| Percentage Range | Meaning     | Implication      |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 100%             | Identical   | No changes       |
| 95-99%           | Minimal     | Formatting only  |
| 90-94%           | Moderate    | Refactoring      |
| 85-89%           | Significant | Same outcomes    |
| Below 85%        | Major       | Requires review  |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file    |

- Match % is unavailable for all files.
- Dimension scores are not calculated for unmatched files.
- Both metrics required for migration readiness.
- No files met the 90% threshold for PASS.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element        | Value        |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Final Recommendation   | NOT APPROVED |
| Primary Justification  | No valid one-to-one matches; all components not comparable |
| Confidence Level       | LOW          |
| Recommended Timeline   | Not recommended |
| Priority | Action Required         | Responsible Team         | Timeline      |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| High    | Provide comparable artifacts | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | Immediate     |

- Migration is not approved due to unmatched status.
- High-priority action is required to generate comparable workflow outputs.
- Responsible team must address gaps before migration can proceed.

This report applies rigorous multi-gate validation and strict input enforcement, ensuring only genuinely matched files are considered. No equivalence was found, and migration readiness is not established. Executive action is required to provide comparable artifacts for future assessment.
