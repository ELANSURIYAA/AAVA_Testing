- No genuine one-to-one matches were detected; all files failed multi-gate matching.
- Each file was present and validated, but intent, normalized signature, structural, and semantic gates did not align for any pair.
- All comparisons marked "Not Comparable" due to dominant intent and core business logic mismatch.
- Migration Impact is High across all components, reflecting inability to validate equivalence.
- Recommendation is conditional due to incomplete comparison; manual review is required before migration.

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report presents a strictly validated comparison of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs for three core components: Documentation, Analyzer, and Plan. All files were present and processed; however, no genuinely matched pairs were detected after applying multi-gate matching (intent, normalized signature, structural, and semantic analysis). Each AAVA 1.0 artifact failed to align with its AAVA 2.0 counterpart, resulting in all comparisons marked "Not Comparable." As a result, migration impact is classified as High for every component, and the overall comparison is incomplete. No match percentages or dimension scores were calculated, and no functional equivalence can be asserted.

Note: 3 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- Strict validation confirms all files are real and processed.
- No functional equivalence established due to unmatched status.
- High migration risk due to absence of comparable artifacts.
- Confidence level is low; migration should not proceed without manual review.
- Business continuity cannot be assured; gaps must be addressed prior to migration.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

No valid one-to-one pairs; match percentage calculation was not performed.

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication     |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 100%             | Identical | No changes      |
| 95-99%           | Minimal   | Formatting only |

| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes  |
| Below 85%        | Major     | Requires review |
| N/A              | No comparison | Missing file |

- Match % is not calculated for unmatched files.
- Dimension scores are unavailable; readiness cannot be determined.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element      | Value         |
|---------------------- |--------------|
| Final Recommendation  | NOT APPROVED |
| Primary Justification | No matched components; migration risk is high |
| Confidence Level      | LOW          |
| Recommended Timeline  | Not recommended |
| Priority              | Action Required | Responsible Team         | Timeline        |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| High                  | Manual mapping | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team| Immediate       |

- Migration is not approved due to lack of matched components.
- Manual review and mapping are required before migration can proceed.
- Responsible team must address gaps and validate equivalence.

This report provides a rigorously validated assessment of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. Due to unmatched components and high risk, migration is not recommended until manual mapping and validation are completed.

Matching Gate Reference:
- Gate 1: Regex-based intent inference (must match)
- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:
1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation
6. Performance Patterns – Efficiency, scalability
7. Unit Test Coverage – Breadth, depth
8. Output Structure & Modularity – Organization, maintainability
9. Documentation Quality – Comments, docstrings
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence – Integration, outputs

Match Percentage Formula:
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100

Decision Threshold Reference:
- PASS: >= 90%
