- All three components in AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 are present, but none pass multi-gate matching for one-to-one comparison.
- No valid matched pairs were detected; all files are flagged as "Not Comparable".
- Unmatched status is due to failed intent, signature, structural, or semantic gates for every possible pair.
- Migration impact is "High" for all components due to missing valid matches.
- The comparison is incomplete; no equivalence or migration safety can be claimed.

---

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report provides a strict, evidence-based comparison of all workflow output files from AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0. Each artifact was validated for physical presence and processed using a deterministic multi-gate matching algorithm. No files from AAVA 1.0 could be mapped one-to-one to any AAVA 2.0 file due to intent, signature, structural, or semantic mismatches. As a result, the comparison is incomplete, and no match percentages or dimension scores can be assigned. Migration impact is assessed as "High" for all components.

Note: 3 files could not be matched, limiting comparison completeness.

- No valid one-to-one matches were detected, preventing functional and migration equivalence.
- All files are present and were processed for content, ensuring strict input validation.
- Unmatched status is due to failed multi-gate matching, not missing files.
- Confidence in migration readiness is low due to lack of comparable pairs.
- Conditional recommendation: Migration should not proceed without manual reconciliation.
- Business continuity cannot be assured under current conditions.

**SECTION 3: HOW COMPARISON & MATCH PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED**

Line-by-line diff and match percentage are calculated only for valid one-to-one matched pairs. Since no matches exist, no percentages are computed.

| Percentage Range | Meaning    | Implication      |
|------------------|------------|------------------|
| 100%             | Identical  | No changes       |
| 95-99%           | Minimal    | Formatting only  |
| 90-94%           | Moderate   | Refactoring      |
| 85-89%           | Significant| Same outcomes    |
| Below 85%        | Major      | Requires review  |
| N/A              | No comparison| Missing file   |

- No match percentages were calculated due to lack of valid matches.
- Dimension scores were not assigned.
- Both metrics are required for migration readiness.
- PASS threshold (90%) was not reached by any pair.

**SECTION 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATION & CLOSING NOTE**

| Decision Element      | Value         |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Final Recommendation | NOT APPROVED  |
| Primary Justification| No valid matched components; migration risk is high |
| Confidence Level     | LOW           |
| Recommended Timeline | Not recommended|
| Priority | Action Required | Responsible Team        | Timeline   |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| High    | Manual reconciliation and review | Workflow Owner / AAVA Team | Immediate |

- Migration is not approved due to absence of valid matched components.
- Manual reconciliation and validation are required before migration.
- Migration risk is high, and business continuity cannot be assured.

Professional closing paragraph:
This report provides a rigorous, deterministic assessment of AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 workflow outputs. No valid matches were found, resulting in high migration risk and a recommendation to delay migration pending manual reconciliation. All findings are strictly evidence-based and reproducible.

**APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL REFERENCE**

Comparison Methodology Summary:
Multi-gate matching framework with regex intent detection, normalized signature matching, structural similarity analysis, and semantic content comparison. SHA-256 hashing and line-by-line diff used for content validation. 10-dimension scoring framework applied to valid one-to-one matches. All calculations deterministic and reproducible.

Matching Gate Reference:
- Gate 1: Regex-based intent inference (must match)
- Gate 2: Normalized token similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 3: Structural feature similarity (>= 85%)
- Gate 4: Semantic content similarity (>= 80%)
- Gate 5: Final confidence aggregation (>= 85%) with one-to-one enforcement

Dimension Scoring Reference:
1. Business / Functional Logic – Rules, outcomes
2. Code / Syntax Accuracy – Coding standards, errors
3. Data Flow & Transformations – Processing, joins
4. Conditional / Control Logic – IF/ELSE, loops
5. Error Handling Strategy – Exceptions, validation
6. Performance Patterns – Efficiency, scalability
7. Unit Test Coverage – Breadth, depth
8. Output Structure & Modularity – Organization, maintainability
9. Documentation Quality – Comments, docstrings
10. End-to-End Functional Equivalence – Integration, outputs

Match Percentage Formula:
```
Match % = (Unchanged Lines / Total Lines) × 100
```

Decision Threshold Reference:
- PASS: >= 90%
- CONDITIONAL PASS: 75-89%
- FAIL: < 75%
