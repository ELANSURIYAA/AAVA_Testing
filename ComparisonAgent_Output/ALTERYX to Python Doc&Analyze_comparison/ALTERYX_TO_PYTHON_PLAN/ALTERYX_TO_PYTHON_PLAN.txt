# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both agents provide cost estimation and testing effort analysis for Python migration from Alteryx workflow. AAVA_Agent delivers specific quantified estimates with detailed breakdowns ($0.75 per execution, 64 hours total effort), while General_Agent provides qualitative assessments with broader ranges (53-76 hours effort). AAVA_Agent shows superior specificity and actionability, while General_Agent acknowledges data limitations more explicitly.

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address the same core objective of estimating costs and testing effort for Alteryx-to-Python migration. AAVA_Agent focuses on specific monetary costs and precise hour estimates, while General_Agent emphasizes the lack of explicit pricing data and provides ranges. Both cover runtime costs, manual fixes, testing effort, and API costs. The semantic intent aligns well but with different approaches to uncertainty handling.

**Key Differences:**
- AAVA_Agent provides specific dollar amounts ($0.75 per execution, $22.50 monthly)
- General_Agent acknowledges missing pricing data and provides qualitative assessments
- Both identify similar cost components but with different granularity levels

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow similar three-section structure: 1) Cost Estimation with Python Runtime Cost subsection, 2) Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation, 3) API Call Cost. AAVA_Agent uses more granular subsections (1.1, 2.1) and detailed breakdowns, while General_Agent uses numbered lists with bullet points. Both maintain logical flow from costs to effort to API pricing.

**Structural Alignment:**
- Consistent section ordering and hierarchy
- Similar subsection breakdown approaches
- Both conclude with API cost statements

### Correctness

**AAVA_Agent (Score: 95/100):**
AAVA_Agent output is syntactically well-formed with proper markdown structure, consistent formatting, and no broken references. Minor issue: API cost format 'apiCost: 0.002 USD' could be more descriptive. All calculations and estimates are internally consistent.

**General_Agent (Score: 92/100):**
General_Agent output has proper structure and formatting. Minor issues include: inconsistent bullet point formatting in lines 8-15, and the duplicate content section at the end (lines 35-50) which appears redundant. Otherwise syntactically correct.

**Overall Correctness: 94/100**

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | AAVA_Agent | General_Agent | Overall |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 92 | 94 |
| **Overall** | - | - | **86** |

## Recommendations

**For AAVA_Agent:**
Excellent specificity in cost breakdowns and effort estimates. Consider adding uncertainty ranges and assumptions documentation. The detailed compute resource breakdown ($0.15, $0.10, $0.05) provides actionable insights for budgeting.

**For General_Agent:**
Good acknowledgment of data limitations and qualitative cost assessment. The effort ranges (29-44 hours, 24-32 hours) provide realistic planning boundaries. Consider adding more specific cost estimation methodologies when pricing data becomes available.

**For Both Agents:**
Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized cost estimation methodology, 2) Clear assumption documentation, 3) Risk factor consideration, 4) Validation criteria definition. AAVA_Agent excels in specificity while General_Agent excels in uncertainty acknowledgment.
