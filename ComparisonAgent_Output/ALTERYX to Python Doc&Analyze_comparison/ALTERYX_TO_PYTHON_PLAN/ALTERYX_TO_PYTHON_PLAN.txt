# Agent Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

Both outputs address cost estimation and testing effort for Python migration from Alteryx workflow. AAVA provides quantitative cost analysis with specific dollar amounts and structured effort breakdown, while Agent 2 offers qualitative analysis with effort ranges. Key differences include cost specificity (AAVA: $0.75/execution vs Agent 2: qualitative assessment), effort estimation precision (AAVA: 64 hours vs Agent 2: 53-76 hours), and API costs (AAVA: $0.002 vs Agent 2: $0.0132).

## Detailed Analysis

### Semantic Similarity (Score: 78/100)

Both outputs address the same core requirements: cost estimation for Python runtime, effort estimation for code fixes and testing, and API call costs. However, AAVA provides quantitative financial analysis while Agent 2 focuses on qualitative assessment acknowledging missing pricing data. Both cover similar effort categories (data transformation, database integration, testing) but with different granularity and precision.

The semantic alignment is strong in terms of addressing the same business problem and covering similar cost components, but differs significantly in approach - AAVA assumes pricing availability while Agent 2 explicitly acknowledges pricing data limitations.

### Structural Similarity (Score: 85/100)

Both outputs follow similar structural organization:
1. Cost Estimation with Python Runtime Cost subsection
2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation  
3. API Call Cost

AAVA uses more detailed subsections (1.1, 2.1) and provides monthly projections, while Agent 2 includes reasoning sections and combines manual fixes with testing in single estimates. Overall flow and logical decomposition are highly aligned, with both following a clear three-part structure that addresses all required elements.

### Correctness

**AAVA (Score: 95/100)**: Demonstrates excellent syntax and internal consistency. All cost calculations are mathematically sound ($0.75 total from component costs, 30 × $0.75 = $22.50 monthly). Effort breakdowns sum correctly to 64 hours. Structure is well-formatted with clear headers and consistent numbering. Minor formatting inconsistency in effort hour presentations.

**Agent 2 (Score: 88/100)**: Shows good structural consistency but has some formatting and referencing issues. References to 'Environmental_Variable.txt' file not provided in context (line 3). Effort ranges are logically consistent (29-44 + 24-32 = 53-76 hours). Some inconsistent formatting in bullet points and section numbering. Content is internally coherent despite missing external references.

**Overall Correctness (Score: 92/100)**: Average correctness score demonstrates both outputs maintain internal logical consistency with AAVA showing superior precision and formatting, while Agent 2 demonstrates good structure despite some referencing and formatting inconsistencies.

## Scoring Summary

| Aspect | AAVA | Agent 2 | Overall |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| Semantic Similarity | - | - | 78 |
| Structural Similarity | - | - | 85 |
| Correctness | 95 | 88 | 92 |
| **Overall** | **86** | **86** | **86** |

## Recommendations

**For AAVA**: 
- Strengths: Excellent quantitative analysis with specific cost breakdowns and precise effort estimates. Well-structured presentation with clear mathematical calculations.
- Recommendations: Consider adding qualitative context for scenarios where pricing data may be unavailable or variable.

**For Agent 2**:
- Strengths: Acknowledges data limitations and provides realistic effort ranges. Good qualitative reasoning for cost components.
- Recommendations: Improve formatting consistency, verify external file references, and consider providing more specific estimates when possible even with limited data.
