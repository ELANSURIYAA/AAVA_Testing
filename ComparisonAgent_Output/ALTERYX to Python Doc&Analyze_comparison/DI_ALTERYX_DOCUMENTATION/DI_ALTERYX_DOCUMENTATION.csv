Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-500,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Alteryx Data Warehousing workflow. Agent_1 focuses on detailed technical specifications with extensive tool breakdowns and complexity metrics, while Agent_2 emphasizes business context and practical implementation details. Both achieve the core objective of documenting ETL processes for language learning trace data transformation into a star schema data warehouse."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,1-500,"Both outputs address identical business objectives: transforming language learning trace data into a dimensional data warehouse. They describe the same ETL workflow, input sources (learning_traces.13m.csv, lexeme_reference.txt), and output targets (dimension/fact tables). Minor differences in emphasis: Agent_1 focuses more on technical complexity metrics while Agent_2 emphasizes business value and practical implementation. Core semantic intent is nearly identical."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,1-500,"Both follow similar documentation structures with workflow overview, tool breakdown, data flow, transformations, technical insights, complexity analysis, assumptions, outputs, and error handling sections. Agent_1 uses more detailed subsections and includes a formal complexity scoring table (line 285-300), while Agent_2 presents information in a more narrative flow. Both include Mermaid diagrams for data flow visualization. Structural approach is highly aligned with minor organizational differences."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,95,1-500,"Agent_1 demonstrates excellent technical accuracy with proper tool names (Text to Columns, Formula, Multi-Field Formula), correct configuration details, and accurate complexity metrics. Minor issues: some tool numbering inconsistencies (Tool 5, Tool 24) and estimated tool counts (~40+ vs exact counts). SQL syntax and ODBC configuration details are accurate."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,93,1-500,"Agent_2 shows strong technical correctness with accurate tool descriptions (DbFileInput, DbFileOutput, Formula, MultiFieldFormula), proper SQL table names, and correct transformation logic. Minor issues: some tool name variations (DbFileInput vs Input Data) and complexity score of 85/100 seems slightly high compared to described features. Overall syntax and technical details are sound."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,1-500,"Both outputs demonstrate high technical accuracy with proper Alteryx tool references, correct SQL syntax, and accurate workflow descriptions. Minor discrepancies in tool naming conventions and complexity assessments, but no major technical errors detected. Both correctly identify the star schema approach and dimensional modeling concepts."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,1-500,"Excellent technical depth and complexity analysis. Consider standardizing tool numbering references and providing exact tool counts rather than estimates. The formal complexity scoring table is valuable for technical audiences."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,1-500,"Strong business context and practical focus. Consider aligning tool naming conventions with standard Alteryx terminology (e.g., Input Data vs DbFileInput). The narrative flow enhances readability for business stakeholders."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,1-500,"Both outputs successfully document the workflow comprehensively. For future iterations, consider: 1) Standardizing tool naming conventions, 2) Including exact tool counts and complexity metrics, 3) Adding more specific error handling procedures, 4) Providing sample data examples for key transformations."
