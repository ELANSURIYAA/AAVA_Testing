Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,,"Both AAVA and Agent2 outputs provide comprehensive documentation for the same Alteryx Data Warehousing workflow. The documents cover identical business objectives (language learning trace analytics), technical components (ETL processes, star schema design), and implementation details. Key similarities include workflow overview, tool breakdown, data flow analysis, transformation logic, and output specifications. Both achieve high semantic alignment (92/100) with nearly identical business understanding and technical approach. Structural organization shows strong similarity (88/100) with consistent section hierarchies and logical flow. Correctness analysis reveals both outputs maintain high syntactic quality (AAVA: 95/100, Agent2: 93/100) with proper formatting, consistent references, and technical accuracy. Minor differences exist in presentation style, detail granularity, and specific technical complexity scoring approaches."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,92,,"Both outputs demonstrate exceptional semantic alignment in understanding and documenting the Alteryx workflow. Core business objectives are identically captured: transforming raw language learning trace data into a star schema data warehouse for analytics and reporting. Technical processes are semantically equivalent: ETL operations, data cleansing, dimension/fact table creation, and SQL database integration. Key semantic elements show 95%+ alignment: workflow purpose (lines 1-20 both outputs), data sources and destinations (lines 100-120 both), transformation logic (lines 200-250 both), and business value proposition (lines 400-420 both). Minor semantic variations include complexity scoring methodology (AAVA uses 68/100, Agent2 uses 85/100 on lines 380-390) and error handling detail level (lines 450-480). Both correctly identify identical technical components, data flow patterns, and output specifications."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,88,,"Structural organization demonstrates strong consistency across both outputs with identical major section hierarchies. Both follow the same 9-section structure: Workflow Overview, Tool Breakdown, Data Flow Breakdown, Data Transformations, Technical Insights, Technical Complexity, Assumptions and Dependencies, Key Outputs, and Error Handling. Section ordering is identical (lines 1-50 both outputs). Subsection organization shows 90%+ alignment in Tool Breakdown (lines 60-150), Data Flow (lines 180-250), and Technical Insights (lines 300-350). Structural differences include: AAVA uses more detailed tool configuration descriptions (lines 70-90), Agent2 provides more granular technical parameter tables (lines 360-380), and presentation formatting varies (AAVA uses more bullet points, Agent2 uses more structured tables on lines 320-340). Both maintain consistent logical flow from business context through technical implementation to outputs and dependencies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA,95,5-10;45-50;120-125;200-205;350-355,"AAVA output demonstrates excellent syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting, consistent section numbering, and accurate technical references. All internal cross-references are valid (lines 5-10, 45-50). Technical terminology is used correctly throughout (lines 120-125, 200-205). Table formatting is consistent and properly structured (lines 350-355). Minor issues include one inconsistent bullet point indentation (line 85) and a minor formatting inconsistency in the complexity table (line 365). All code examples, file paths, and technical specifications are syntactically correct. Document structure follows proper markdown conventions with appropriate heading levels and consistent formatting patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent2,93,15-20;95-100;180-185;340-345;420-425,"Agent2 output maintains high syntactic quality with proper document structure and technical accuracy. Markdown formatting is consistent with appropriate heading hierarchies (lines 15-20). Technical specifications are accurately presented (lines 95-100, 180-185). Mermaid diagram syntax is correct (lines 180-185). Minor syntactic issues include inconsistent spacing in technical parameter table (lines 340-345) and one formatting irregularity in the output section (lines 420-425). All file paths, tool names, and technical references are syntactically valid. Code examples and configuration details maintain proper formatting throughout the document."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,,"Combined correctness score reflects both outputs maintaining high syntactic standards with proper formatting, accurate technical references, and consistent document structure. Average of individual scores (95+93)/2 = 94. Both documents demonstrate professional technical writing quality with minimal formatting issues and accurate technical content presentation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA,,"AAVA output excels in detailed tool configuration descriptions and comprehensive business context. Strengths include thorough transformation logic explanation (lines 200-250), detailed technical complexity analysis (lines 350-380), and comprehensive error handling coverage (lines 450-480). Recommendations: 1) Standardize bullet point formatting for consistency (line 85), 2) Enhance technical parameter table formatting (line 365), 3) Consider adding more quantitative metrics in complexity analysis to match Agent2 approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent2,,"Agent2 output provides excellent structured presentation and detailed technical parameter analysis. Strengths include comprehensive tool diversity analysis (lines 320-340), detailed technical complexity scoring (lines 360-390), and well-organized technical insights section (lines 300-350). Recommendations: 1) Fix spacing inconsistencies in technical parameter table (lines 340-345), 2) Enhance business context detail to match AAVA depth (lines 1-30), 3) Standardize output section formatting (lines 420-425) for improved readability."
