Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both AAVA_Documentation and Session_Documentation provide comprehensive analysis of Alteryx to Python workflow conversion. AAVA_Documentation offers a more structured tabular approach with explicit complexity scoring (68/100) and detailed tool mappings. Session_Documentation provides deeper technical analysis with higher complexity scoring (85/100) and more granular syntax difference enumeration. Both outputs address the same business objective of converting language learning trace ETL workflows but differ in analytical depth and presentation format."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,82,"Lines 1-50 (both outputs)","Both outputs address identical core objectives: analyzing Alteryx workflow for Python conversion in language learning trace ETL context. AAVA_Documentation focuses on business problem solving and standardization aspects (lines 8-12). Session_Documentation emphasizes dimensional star schema and educational insights (lines 3-6). Both identify same data sources (CSV, TXT files) and similar transformation requirements. Semantic alignment is strong with minor emphasis differences on business vs technical perspectives."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Section headers 1-8 vs 1-7","Both outputs follow numbered section structure but with different organizational approaches. AAVA_Documentation uses 8 sections with tabular complexity metrics (lines 15-35) and explicit Alteryx-to-Python mapping table (lines 40-55). Session_Documentation uses 7 sections with narrative complexity analysis and embedded technical details. Both include workflow overview, complexity analysis, syntax differences, and optimization recommendations but structure information differently. AAVA uses more tables while Session uses more narrative descriptions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,AAVA_Documentation,95,"Lines 15-35, 40-55","AAVA_Documentation demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-formatted tables, consistent markdown structure, and accurate technical mappings. Minor issues include generic complexity interpretation descriptions and some redundant information in optimization section. All internal references are consistent and formatting is proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Session_Documentation,92,"Lines 60-80, 90-110","Session_Documentation shows strong syntactic correctness with proper markdown formatting and comprehensive technical analysis. Minor issues include inconsistent metric formatting in some sections and occasional verbose descriptions that could be more concise. Technical accuracy is high with detailed function mappings and optimization strategies."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,94,"N/A","Average correctness score of 93.5 rounded to 94. Both outputs maintain high syntactic quality with proper markdown formatting, consistent internal references, and accurate technical content. Minor formatting inconsistencies and verbosity issues prevent perfect scores."

Recommendations,Recommendation,AAVA_Documentation,N/A,"Lines 40-55, 65-75","Strengthen the complexity analysis section by providing more granular technical details similar to Session_Documentation. Consider adding more detailed syntax difference enumeration and specific code examples for manual adjustments. The tabular format is excellent for readability but could benefit from more technical depth."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Session_Documentation,N/A,"Lines 25-45, 85-105","Improve structural organization by adopting more tabular presentations for complex metrics and mappings as shown in AAVA_Documentation. Consider consolidating verbose descriptions into more concise, actionable formats. The technical depth is excellent but presentation could be more scannable and reference-friendly."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,"Overall outputs","Both outputs would benefit from: 1) Standardized complexity scoring methodology with explicit criteria, 2) Consistent technical depth across all sections, 3) More specific line-by-line code conversion examples, 4) Integration of business and technical perspectives for comprehensive analysis, 5) Addition of validation checkpoints and quality assurance recommendations for the conversion process."
