Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both outputs provide comprehensive documentation for Alteryx to Python conversion workflows. Agent_1 focuses on structured metrics and mapping tables with clear business objectives, while Agent_2 provides more detailed technical analysis with specific tool breakdowns. Both address the same core challenge of ETL workflow conversion but with different analytical approaches and depth levels."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50 (Agent_1), Lines 1-80 (Agent_2)","Both outputs address the same fundamental goal of documenting Alteryx to Python conversion for data warehousing workflows. They share identical business objectives around language learning trace analytics and educational insights. Key semantic alignments include: ETL process documentation, star schema implementation, data quality focus, and educational analytics purpose. Differences emerge in analytical depth and technical specificity, with Agent_2 providing more granular tool analysis."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,78,"Lines 10-45 (Agent_1), Lines 15-60 (Agent_2)","Both outputs follow similar documentation structures with numbered sections, complexity metrics tables, and mapping approaches. Structural similarities include: workflow overview sections, complexity metrics tables, Alteryx to Python mapping sections, and optimization recommendations. Agent_1 uses 8 main sections while Agent_2 uses 7, both include tabular data presentation. Key structural difference is Agent_2's more detailed syntax differences section and expanded manual adjustments coverage."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_1,92,"Lines 15-20, 35-40","Agent_1 demonstrates high syntactic correctness with well-formed markdown tables, consistent section numbering, and proper CSV structure references. Minor issues include: complexity score presentation could be more detailed (line 35), and some metric interpretations lack specific technical justification (lines 15-20). All internal references are consistent and formatting is proper."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Agent_2,88,"Lines 25-30, 55-65","Agent_2 shows good syntactic correctness with comprehensive technical details and proper markdown formatting. Issues identified: some inconsistent metric counting methodology (lines 25-30), complexity score justification could be more structured (lines 55-65), and occasional redundancy in technical explanations. Internal references are mostly consistent with minor formatting variations."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average correctness score reflects both outputs' strong technical accuracy and proper formatting, with minor areas for improvement in metric methodology and score justification clarity."

Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_1,,"Enhance complexity score methodology with more detailed technical justification. Expand on specific syntax differences with code examples. Consider adding more granular tool-by-tool analysis similar to Agent_2's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Agent_2,,"Improve consistency in metric counting methodology. Streamline redundant technical explanations for better readability. Consider more structured presentation of complexity scoring rationale similar to Agent_1's approach."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs would benefit from: standardized complexity scoring methodology, integrated code examples for syntax differences, cross-referencing between mapping tables and manual adjustments sections, and unified approach to technical depth vs. readability balance."
