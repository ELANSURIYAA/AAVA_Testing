[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

The comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 metadata reveals a significant structural evolution while maintaining core semantic integrity. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more sophisticated hierarchical structure with enhanced metadata organization, moving from a flat node-based approach to a structured workflow-agent architecture. The semantic meaning remains largely preserved with 88% similarity, though structural changes are more pronounced at 75% similarity. Both versions maintain high correctness standards with valid JSON syntax and internal consistency. The overall alignment score of 87% indicates a well-managed evolution that preserves business logic while modernizing the metadata architecture.

[DETAILED ANALYSIS]

Semantic Similarity (88/100):
The core business functionality and agent purposes remain semantically equivalent between versions. All three agents (Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases) preserve their fundamental responsibilities and operational logic. The task descriptions, expected outputs, and business requirements show minimal semantic drift. Key semantic alignments include:
- Agent purposes and responsibilities remain identical
- Task descriptions maintain the same business logic
- Expected output formats and requirements are preserved
- Tool usage patterns and workflow dependencies are consistent

Minor semantic variations include enhanced metadata requirements in AAVA 2.0 and slight refinements in cost estimation sections, but these represent evolutionary improvements rather than fundamental changes.

Structural Similarity (75/100):
AAVA 2.0 introduces significant structural reorganization while maintaining logical consistency. The most notable changes include:
- Root-level restructuring: AAVA 1.0 uses flat "nodes" array vs AAVA 2.0's hierarchical "workFlowDetail" and "workflowAgents"
- Enhanced metadata organization with explicit workflow identification
- Agent representation evolution from simple objects to structured entities with IDs and enhanced properties
- Model specification changes from "gpt-4" to "gpt-4.1"
- Tool reference methodology updated from direct tool names to structured "toolReferences" arrays

These structural changes represent architectural modernization rather than functional degradation, improving metadata organization and system integration capabilities.

Correctness Analysis:

AAVA 1.0 (100/100):
No syntax or structural issues identified. The JSON is well-formed with:
- Valid JSON syntax throughout
- Consistent object structures
- Proper array formatting
- No orphaned references or broken links
- Logical consistency in agent definitions and relationships

AAVA 2.0 (100/100):
No syntax or structural issues identified. The JSON maintains high quality with:
- Valid JSON syntax throughout
- Enhanced structural organization
- Consistent hierarchical relationships
- Proper agent ID referencing
- Logical workflow organization

[REASONS FOR DEDUCTIONS]

- Semantic drift in cost estimation formatting (AAVA 2.0 lines 95-105): Minor variations in cost calculation presentation
- Structural reorganization of root metadata (AAVA 1.0 line 2 vs AAVA 2.0 lines 2-5): Fundamental architectural changes from flat to hierarchical structure
- Agent identification methodology change (AAVA 1.0 line 6 vs AAVA 2.0 line 8): Introduction of explicit agent IDs and enhanced metadata
- Model version evolution (AAVA 1.0 line 8 vs AAVA 2.0 line 10): Upgrade from gpt-4 to gpt-4.1
- Tool reference structure modification (AAVA 1.0 line 9 vs AAVA 2.0 line 11): Migration from direct tool arrays to structured toolReferences
- Workflow naming convention refinement (AAVA 1.0 line 3 vs AAVA 2.0 line 4): Enhanced naming consistency and clarity
