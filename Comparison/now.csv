deduction,executive_summary,"AAVA 2.0 represents a structural evolution of AAVA 1.0 with significant schema changes while preserving core semantic content. The workflow container structure has been completely redesigned from flat properties to nested objects. Agent definitions have been restructured with new identification patterns and tool reference mechanisms. Despite these structural changes, the core agent descriptions and functional specifications remain semantically equivalent with 85% similarity.",,
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Core agent functionality and business logic remain highly preserved across versions. All three agents maintain identical or near-identical description content, indicating strong semantic continuity. The technical specification requirements, data model change processes, and functional test case generation logic show no semantic degradation.",,
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces a completely new structural paradigm. The flat workflow properties (workflowId, workflowName, nodes) have been replaced with nested objects (workFlowDetail, workflowAgents). Agent containers have been restructured from task-based to description-based with new metadata patterns.",,
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates high internal consistency with valid JSON structure, complete agent definitions, and proper task/expectedOutput pairing. All agents contain required fields and maintain referential integrity.",,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows strong structural correctness with valid JSON, complete agent definitions, and consistent new schema patterns. The nested structure maintains logical relationships and proper field organization.",,
deduction,schema_evolution,"The schema evolution represents a major version change from task-oriented to description-oriented agent definitions. This suggests a fundamental shift in how agent metadata is conceptualized and managed within the AAVA framework.",,
