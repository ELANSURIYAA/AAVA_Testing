Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,1-78,"Both outputs represent workflow configuration files for a data integration pipeline with three agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. The files contain nearly identical functional content but differ significantly in JSON structure and field naming conventions. DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_1 uses a flat structure with 'nodes' array, while DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_2 uses nested 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure. Despite structural differences, both files define the same three-agent workflow with identical task descriptions and expected outputs."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,1-78,"Both files define identical workflow semantics with same three agents, identical task descriptions, and expected outputs. Minor semantic differences include model versions (gpt-4 vs gpt-4.1) and tool references structure. Core business logic and agent purposes are semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,65,1-78,"Significant structural differences: File 1 uses flat structure with 'workflowId', 'workflowName', 'nodes' array. File 2 uses nested structure with 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array. Field naming differs: 'agentName' vs 'name', 'tools' vs 'toolReferences'. JSON hierarchy and organization patterns are fundamentally different."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_1,100,1-78,"Valid JSON syntax with proper structure. All fields correctly formatted, arrays properly closed, objects well-formed. No syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_2,100,1-78,"Valid JSON syntax with proper nested structure. All objects and arrays correctly formatted, proper field definitions, no syntax errors detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,1-78,"Both files demonstrate perfect JSON syntax correctness with no structural or formatting errors."

Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_1,95,1-78,"Excellent semantic alignment and syntax correctness. Consider adopting nested structure for better organization and clarity. Model version consistency should be maintained across environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN_2,90,1-78,"Strong semantic content with improved nested structure. Tool references structure is cleaner. Consider standardizing field naming conventions to match organizational standards and ensure model version alignment."
