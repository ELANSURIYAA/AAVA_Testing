Section,Key,Value
Executive Summary,Overall Assessment,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 with enhanced organization and metadata richness"
Executive Summary,Major Changes,"Restructured workflow representation from flat to hierarchical, enhanced agent metadata, improved tool references"
Executive Summary,Compatibility Risk,"Medium - structural changes require adaptation but semantic meaning preserved"
Executive Summary,Recommendation,"Proceed with migration using structured mapping approach"

Semantic Analysis,Core Workflow Meaning,"Preserved - both versions represent the same DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN workflow"
Semantic Analysis,Agent Functionality,"Preserved - all three agents maintain identical core functionality and descriptions"
Semantic Analysis,Business Logic,"Preserved - technical specifications, delta modeling, and test case generation remain consistent"
Semantic Analysis,Semantic Similarity Score,85

Structural Analysis,Organization Model,"Changed - flat structure (1.0) to hierarchical workFlowDetail/workflowAgents (2.0)"
Structural Analysis,Metadata Enhancement,"Enhanced - added agentId, modelDeploymentName, toolReferences in 2.0"
Structural Analysis,Field Naming,"Evolved - workflowId->id, workflowName->name, agentName->name, nodes->workflowAgents"
Structural Analysis,Tool References,"Improved - tools array (1.0) to structured toolReferences (2.0)"
Structural Analysis,Structural Similarity Score,72

Deductions,Structural Changes,"15 points - significant reorganization from flat to hierarchical structure"
Deductions,Field Renaming,"10 points - multiple field name changes requiring mapping"
Deductions,Tool Reference Changes,"3 points - tools array to toolReferences structure change"

Key Mappings,workflowId,"1594 -> workFlowDetail.id: 2147"
Key Mappings,workflowName,"DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN -> workFlowDetail.name: DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN"
Key Mappings,nodes,"-> workflowAgents (structural reorganization)"
Key Mappings,agentName,"-> name (field rename)"
Key Mappings,model,"gpt-4 -> modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1"
Key Mappings,tools,"-> toolReferences (enhanced structure)"

Risk Assessment,Migration Complexity,Medium
Risk Assessment,Breaking Changes,"Field name changes require code updates"
Risk Assessment,Data Loss Risk,None
Risk Assessment,Compatibility Impact,"Downstream systems need structural mapping updates"

Recommendations,Migration Strategy,"Implement field mapping layer for backward compatibility"
Recommendations,Testing Approach,"Validate all agent functionality post-migration"
Recommendations,Documentation,"Update API documentation to reflect structural changes"
Recommendations,Rollback Plan,"Maintain AAVA 1.0 support during transition period"
