  "executiveSummary": {
    "overview": "AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0, introducing hierarchical organization and enhanced metadata while preserving core semantic meaning. The migration shows strong semantic alignment (92%) with moderate structural changes (78%) and excellent technical correctness (98%).",
    "majorDifferences": [
      "Structural reorganization from flat array to hierarchical object model",
      "Introduction of workFlowDetail container with explicit ID and name separation",
      "Agent metadata enhancement with agentId and modelDeploymentName fields",
      "Removal of tools array in favor of toolReferences array",
      "Renaming of core fields (workflowId->id, workflowName->name, agentName->name)"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Breaking changes for systems expecting flat 'nodes' array structure",
      "Tool reference mechanism change may impact tool resolution logic",
      "Field name changes require mapping updates in dependent systems"
    ],
    "overallAssessment": "AAVA 2.0 represents a well-structured evolution that improves metadata organization and clarity while maintaining semantic integrity. Migration requires careful handling of structural changes but offers improved maintainability."
