Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Both agents produced comprehensive ABAP to PySpark migration validation scripts with similar semantic intent and workflow structure. Agent 1.0_1 delivered a class-based architecture with extensive pytest testing, while Agent 2.0_1 provided a configuration-driven approach with multiple storage backend support."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,85,"Lines 1-50, 100-150, 200-250","Both outputs address identical core objectives: ABAP code parsing, execution simulation, Parquet conversion, distributed storage transfer, PySpark transformation execution, and result comparison. Minor differences in implementation approach (class-based vs function-based) but same overall intent and business logic."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-100, 150-300","Similar high-level workflow structure but different architectural patterns. Agent 1.0_1 uses object-oriented class-based design with methods, while Agent 2.0_1 uses procedural functions with configuration sections. Both follow logical sequence: parse -> execute -> convert -> transfer -> transform -> compare -> report."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,1.0_1,95,"Lines 1-20, 50-80, 400-500","Excellent code structure with proper imports, complete class definition, comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, detailed logging configuration, and full pytest test suite covering happy path, edge cases, and boundary conditions."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,2.0_1,85,"Lines 1-30, 80-120, 200-250","Good overall structure with configuration management and environment variable usage. However, some areas lack proper exception handling (lines 180-200), incomplete implementation details for HDFS operations (line 95), and missing validation for some edge cases."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,90,,"Average of individual agent correctness scores: (95 + 85) / 2 = 90. Both outputs demonstrate strong technical competency with proper Python syntax and logical flow."

Recommendations,Recommendation,1.0_1,,"Excellent implementation with comprehensive testing. Consider adding configuration management similar to Agent 2.0_1 for production deployment flexibility."
Recommendations,Recommendation,2.0_1,,"Strong configuration-driven approach. Enhance error handling consistency throughout the script and complete HDFS implementation details for production readiness."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,,"Both outputs demonstrate high quality. Consider combining the class-based architecture of Agent 1.0_1 with the configuration management approach of Agent 2.0_1 for optimal production deployment."
