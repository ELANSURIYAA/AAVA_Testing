deduction,executive_summary,"The two AAVA metadata versions represent the same conceptual workflow model with significant structural evolution and enhanced metadata organization. AAVA 2.0 introduces improved hierarchical structure and enhanced agent metadata while preserving core semantic meaning.",1,1
deduction,semantic_analysis,"Both versions represent a data integration workflow with three core agents: Technical Specification, Delta Model Changes, and Functional Test Cases. The business purpose and agent responsibilities remain semantically identical.",1,1
deduction,structural_analysis,"AAVA 2.0 introduces major structural reorganization with nested workFlowDetail object and enhanced workflowAgents array structure, moving from flat to hierarchical organization.",1,2
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowId' renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.id' with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deduction,field_change,"Root field 'workflowName' renamed to nested 'workFlowDetail.name' with value change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN' (underscore removed).",3,4
deduction,structural_analysis,"Array field 'nodes' renamed to 'workflowAgents' with enhanced object structure including agentId and modelDeploymentName fields.",4,6
deduction,field_change,"Agent name 'DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN' renamed to 'DI Data Technical Specification SN' (underscores removed) across all three agents.",6,8
deduction,type_change,"Model field changed from simple string 'gpt-4' to enhanced 'modelDeploymentName' with value 'gpt-4.1' indicating version upgrade.",8,10
deduction,structural_analysis,"Tools array structure changed from simple string array ['DI_Github_File_Writer_Z'] to empty 'toolReferences' array, representing architectural shift.",9,45
deduction,constraint_change,"Task object structure flattened in AAVA 2.0 - nested task.description and task.expectedOutput merged into single description field.",10,11
deduction,governance_issue,"AAVA 2.0 removes expectedOutput specifications that were present in AAVA 1.0, potentially reducing metadata completeness for governance.",11,
deduction,field_change,"Second agent name 'DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN' renamed to 'DI Delta Model Changes SN' with consistent underscore removal pattern.",35,47
deduction,field_change,"Third agent name 'DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN' renamed to 'DI Functional Test Cases SN' following same naming convention change.",60,70
deduction,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 metadata is syntactically valid JSON with consistent internal structure and no broken references.",1,
deduction,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 metadata is syntactically valid JSON with enhanced structure, though some metadata fields are simplified or removed.",1,
deduction,schema_evolution,"Migration represents major version evolution with breaking changes in field names, structure hierarchy, and tool reference handling.",1,1
deduction,risk,"Structural changes may break existing systems expecting flat workflow structure and specific field names like 'workflowId' and 'nodes'.",2,3
deduction,risk,"Removal of expectedOutput specifications may impact downstream documentation generation and validation processes.",11,
deduction,ambiguity,"Empty toolReferences arrays in AAVA 2.0 create ambiguity about whether tools are deprecated or moved to different configuration layer.",9,45
deduction,general_finding,"Consistent naming convention change from snake_case to space-separated format improves readability but requires system-wide updates.",6,8
deduction,general_finding,"Enhanced agent metadata with agentId fields provides better traceability and system integration capabilities.",6,7
deduction,general_finding,"Model version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' indicates platform evolution and potential capability enhancements.",8,10
