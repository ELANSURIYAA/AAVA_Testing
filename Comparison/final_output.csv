EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,SCORES,SCORING TABLE,DETAILED ANALYSIS,REASONS FOR DEDUCTIONS

"The comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 metadata reveals a significant structural evolution while maintaining semantic consistency. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more hierarchical and detailed structure with enhanced metadata organization, moving from a flat array-based approach to a nested object structure with dedicated workflow details and agent references.","Semantic Similarity: 85, Structural Similarity: 70, Correctness AAVA 1.0: 100, Correctness AAVA 2.0: 100, Overall: 88","| Aspect | AAVA 1.0 | AAVA 2.0 | Overall |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|  
| Semantic Similarity | 85 | 85 | 85 |
| Structural Similarity | 70 | 70 | 70 |
| Correctness | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Overall | - | - | 88 |","**Semantic Similarity Analysis (Score: 85)**
The core business meaning remains consistent between versions. Both represent the same workflow 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' with identical agent functionalities:
- DI Data Technical Specification agent maintains same core responsibilities
- DI Delta Model Changes agent preserves same analytical functions  
- DI Functional Test Cases agent retains identical test case generation logic
All agent descriptions and task definitions are semantically equivalent, with only minor formatting differences.

**Structural Similarity Analysis (Score: 70)**
Significant structural reorganization occurred:
- AAVA 1.0 uses flat structure with 'workflowId', 'workflowName', 'nodes' array
- AAVA 2.0 introduces nested 'workFlowDetail' object and 'workflowAgents' array
- Agent representation evolved from simple objects to detailed structures with 'agentId', 'modelDeploymentName', 'toolReferences'
- Model specification changed from 'model: gpt-4' to 'modelDeploymentName: gpt-4.1'
- Tools handling shifted from 'tools' array to 'toolReferences' array

**Correctness Analysis**
- AAVA 1.0 Correctness: 100 - Valid JSON syntax, consistent internal structure, no broken references
- AAVA 2.0 Correctness: 100 - Valid JSON syntax, consistent internal structure, proper object relationships","**Semantic Similarity Deductions (-15 points):**
- Line 4: Model version upgrade from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-4.1' represents semantic evolution
- Minor terminology variations in field naming conventions

**Structural Similarity Deductions (-30 points):**
- Lines 1-3: Complete restructuring of root-level metadata (workflowId/workflowName → workFlowDetail object)
- Lines 5-15: Agent array structure completely reorganized (nodes → workflowAgents)
- Lines 8,20,32: Introduction of agentId fields not present in AAVA 1.0
- Lines 9,21,33: Model field renamed and relocated (model → modelDeploymentName)
- Lines 44,45,46: Tools array replaced with empty toolReferences arrays
- Hierarchical depth increased with nested object structures"
