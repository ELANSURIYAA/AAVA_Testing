Summary,executive_summary,,,,,HIGH,,"AAVA 2.0 represents a significant structural evolution from AAVA 1.0 with major schema reorganization, agent renaming, and field restructuring. The migration introduces breaking changes that require careful orchestration."
Summary,semantic_analysis,,,,,MEDIUM,,"Core semantic meaning is preserved across all three agents, but structural presentation has been completely reorganized with new container hierarchies and field naming conventions."
Summary,structural_analysis,,,,,HIGH,,"Complete structural reorganization from flat node array to hierarchical workFlowDetail/workflowAgents structure. All field names have been systematically updated."
Summary,schema_evolution,,,,,HIGH,,"Schema evolution represents a major version change with breaking compatibility. Migration tooling will be required for all downstream systems."
Scoring,semantic_similarity,,,85,,,,"High semantic preservation despite structural changes. All core agent functionality and descriptions remain intact."
Scoring,structural_similarity,,,25,,,,"Low structural similarity due to complete schema reorganization and field renaming across all levels."
Scoring,correctness_aava1,,,100,,,,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax correctness with valid structure and no orphaned references."
Scoring,correctness_aava2,,,100,,,,"AAVA 2.0 demonstrates perfect JSON syntax correctness with valid hierarchical structure and consistent field naming."
Scoring,correctness_average,,,100,,,,"Both versions maintain perfect syntactic and structural correctness."
Scoring,overall_score,,,77,,,,"Good overall alignment with high semantic preservation offset by significant structural changes requiring migration effort."
Deductions,correctness_aava1,,,,,,,"No syntax errors detected. Valid JSON structure with consistent field naming and proper array/object nesting."
Deductions,correctness_aava2,,,,,,,"No syntax errors detected. Valid JSON structure with improved hierarchical organization and consistent naming conventions."
