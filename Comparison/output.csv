[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

The comparison between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 metadata reveals a significant structural evolution while maintaining core semantic alignment. AAVA 2.0 introduces a more sophisticated hierarchical organization with enhanced agent metadata management, improved model deployment specifications, and refined tool reference handling. The workflow maintains the same business purpose (DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN) but adopts a more enterprise-grade architecture.

Key Changes:
- Structural reorganization from flat nodes array to hierarchical workFlowDetail + workflowAgents
- Enhanced agent metadata with explicit IDs and improved model specifications
- Refined tool reference system (from string array to structured references)
- Improved naming conventions and field organization
- Maintained semantic consistency across all three core agents

Risks: Moderate - existing integrations will require updates due to structural changes, but business logic remains intact.

[DETAILED ANALYSIS]

Semantic Similarity (92/100):
The semantic alignment between AAVA 1.0 and AAVA 2.0 is exceptionally strong. All three core agents maintain identical business purposes and functional descriptions:

1. DI Data Technical Specification Agent: Both versions preserve the complete technical specification creation workflow, including JIRA story processing, confluence context analysis, DDL integration, and source-to-target mapping capabilities.

2. DI Delta Model Changes Agent: The DMEA functionality remains semantically identical, maintaining all six processing stages (Model Ingestion, Spec Parsing, Delta Computation, Impact Assessment, DDL Generation, Documentation).

3. DI Functional Test Cases Agent: Test case generation logic and markdown formatting requirements are preserved exactly.

Minor semantic variations (8-point deduction):
- Workflow identification evolved from simple numeric ID (1594) to structured object with ID (2147) and formal name
- Agent naming conventions show slight refinement (spaces vs underscores)
- Model deployment specifications became more explicit (gpt-4 vs gpt-4.1)

Structural Similarity (78/100):
AAVA 2.0 introduces significant architectural improvements while maintaining logical consistency:

Major Structural Changes:
- Root-level reorganization: workflowId/workflowName → workFlowDetail object (lines 1-4 vs 2-5)
- Agent container evolution: nodes array → workflowAgents array (line 5 vs 6)
- Enhanced agent metadata: added agentId field and structured model deployment (lines 8-12 vs 8-13)
- Tool reference refinement: tools string array → toolReferences structured array (line 11 vs 42)

Preserved Structural Elements:
- Three-agent workflow architecture maintained
- Agent task descriptions preserve identical structure and content
- Expected output formatting requirements unchanged
- Cost estimation sections remain structurally consistent

22-point deduction reflects the significant but purposeful architectural evolution that requires integration updates while improving metadata management capabilities.

Correctness Analysis:

AAVA 1.0 (100/100):
- Valid JSON syntax throughout
- Consistent field types and structure
- No orphaned references or broken links
- Logical workflow progression maintained
- All required agent properties present

AAVA 2.0 (100/100):
- Valid JSON syntax with proper nested object structure
- Enhanced type consistency with structured metadata
- No broken references in new toolReferences system
- Improved logical organization with workFlowDetail hierarchy
- All enhanced agent properties properly defined

Both versions demonstrate excellent internal consistency and syntactic correctness.

[REASONS FOR DEDUCTIONS]

- Semantic Similarity (-8 points): Minor naming convention changes and workflow identification evolution from simple ID to structured object
- Structural Similarity (-22 points): Significant architectural reorganization including root-level restructuring (workflowId/workflowName to workFlowDetail object), agent container evolution (nodes to workflowAgents), enhanced agent metadata with agentId addition, and tool reference system refinement (tools array to toolReferences structure)
- No correctness deductions: Both versions maintain perfect JSON validity and internal consistency
