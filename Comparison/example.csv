deductions,executive_summary,"The AAVA 2.0 metadata represents a significant structural evolution of the workflow definition with enhanced organization and agent management while preserving core semantic meaning. The transformation from a flat array-based structure to a hierarchical object model demonstrates architectural maturation.",1,1
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Core workflow concept 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' preserved across both versions with identical business purpose for data integration specification and model updates.",3,4
deductions,semantic_analysis,"All three agent functionalities maintained: Technical Specification (DI_Data_Technical_Specification_SN), Delta Model Changes (DI_Delta_Model_Changes_SN), and Functional Test Cases (DI_Functional_Test_Cases_SN).",7,8
deductions,semantic_analysis,"Agent descriptions remain functionally identical preserving business logic and operational requirements across versions.",7,8
deductions,structural_analysis,"Major structural reorganization: AAVA 1.0 uses flat 'nodes' array while AAVA 2.0 introduces hierarchical 'workFlowDetail' and 'workflowAgents' structure.",1,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Workflow identification enhanced: Simple 'workflowId' and 'workflowName' in v1.0 evolved to structured 'workFlowDetail' object with 'id' and 'name' properties in v2.0.",2,2
deductions,structural_analysis,"Agent metadata significantly expanded: v2.0 introduces 'agentId', 'modelDeploymentName', and 'toolReferences' providing enhanced traceability and deployment management.",7,8
deductions,field_change,"Workflow identifier renamed: 'workflowId' (v1.0 line 2) becomes 'workFlowDetail.id' (v2.0 line 3) with value change from 1594 to 2147.",2,3
deductions,field_change,"Workflow name field renamed: 'workflowName' (v1.0 line 3) becomes 'workFlowDetail.name' (v2.0 line 4) with minor formatting change from 'DI_DataSpecs_Modelupdates_SN' to 'DI DataSpecs Modelupdates SN'.",3,4
deductions,field_change,"Agent container renamed: 'nodes' array (v1.0 line 4) becomes 'workflowAgents' array (v2.0 line 6) improving semantic clarity.",4,6
deductions,field_change,"Agent naming standardized: 'agentName' (v1.0) becomes 'name' (v2.0) with consistent agent identification approach.",8,9
deductions,type_change,"Model specification enhanced: Simple 'model' string 'gpt-4' (v1.0 line 9) evolved to 'modelDeploymentName' with version 'gpt-4.1' (v2.0 line 11) indicating deployment-aware model management.",9,11
deductions,structural_enhancement,"Tool management restructured: 'tools' array with string values (v1.0 line 10) replaced by 'toolReferences' empty array (v2.0 line 12) suggesting reference-based tool association.",10,12
deductions,governance_issue,"Task structure complexity increased: Nested task objects with extensive description and expectedOutput fields create potential maintenance overhead in v2.0.",11,12
deductions,correctness_aava1,"AAVA 1.0 demonstrates solid JSON structure with consistent field naming and logical organization within the flat array model.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava1,"All required workflow and agent properties present with appropriate data types and no syntax errors detected.",1,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"AAVA 2.0 shows improved structural organization but introduces minor inconsistencies in field naming conventions ('workFlowDetail' vs 'workflowAgents').",2,
deductions,correctness_aava2,"Enhanced metadata structure provides better separation of concerns but increases complexity for simple workflow definitions.",2,
deductions,schema_evolution,"Evolution represents a major version change with breaking structural modifications requiring migration scripts for dependent systems.",1,1
deductions,risk,"Workflow ID change from 1594 to 2147 may break existing references and tracking systems without proper migration handling.",2,3
deductions,risk,"Tool reference mechanism change from direct array to reference-based approach requires validation of tool availability and access patterns.",10,12
deductions,risk,"Increased metadata complexity in v2.0 may impact system performance and require enhanced validation logic.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Both versions maintain high correctness with valid JSON syntax and logical field relationships.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Semantic preservation is strong with all core business concepts and agent functionalities maintained across versions.",1,1
deductions,general_finding,"Structural evolution demonstrates architectural maturity but introduces migration complexity for existing integrations.",1,1
