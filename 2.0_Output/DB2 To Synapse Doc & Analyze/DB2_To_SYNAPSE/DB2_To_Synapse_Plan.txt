a) Synapse SQL Runtime Cost Estimation

- Data processed: ~6GB (10% of total 60GB across EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables).
- Cluster configuration: 4 worker nodes (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM each), 1 driver node (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM).
- Pricing: $0.45 per DBU-hour (mid-tier estimate).
- Workload: Table creation, data insertion, select queries, joins, updates, deletes, stored procedure execution, and transactions.
- Estimated DBU-hours: 1 DBU-hour (moderate ETL + DML workload, reasonable parallelism).
- Synapse SQL runtime cost: **$0.45 USD** (1 DBU-hour x $0.45/DBU-hour).

b) Synapse SQL Manual Code Fixing and Unit Testing Effort

- Script complexity: Table creation, DML (insert, update, delete), joins, stored procedure, transaction handling.
- Manual code fixing effort: 2-3 hours (syntax differences, temp table handling, procedure conversion).
- Unit testing effort: 2-3 hours (test cases for each operation, validation of logic and integrity).
- Total manual code fixing & unit testing: **5 hours** (average).

c) Output Validation Effort (DB2 vs Synapse)

- Tasks: Extract outputs from DB2 and Synapse for key queries, compare row counts, sums, sample data, resolve discrepancies.
- Output validation effort: **2.5 hours** (for two tables, joins, DML operations).

d) Total Estimated Effort in Hours

- Manual code fixing & unit testing: 5 hours
- Output validation: 2.5 hours
- **Total estimated effort: 7.5 hours**
- Reason: Moderate script complexity, manageable number of tables and operations, most time spent on SQL compatibility and validating business logic/data consistency.
