Description:   The actual converted Fabric code (PySpark or Fabric SQL) for the Load_HoldingsFact process is not present in the current files. All available files contain only the original Synapse stored procedure and documentation/analysis, not the Fabric implementation. Please provide the actual Fabric code output from the previous agent so that unit tests and Pytest scripts can be generated as required.
