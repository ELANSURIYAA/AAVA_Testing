- Description: Review checklist and report template for validating Synapse → Fabric code conversions

---

1. **Summary**

The required converted Fabric code (PySpark or Fabric SQL) for the Load_HoldingsFact process is missing from all available files. All files provided contain only the original Synapse stored procedure and documentation/analysis for LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY, not Load_HoldingsFact. No converted Fabric implementation is present for review.

2. **Conversion Accuracy**

Unable to assess conversion accuracy. The actual Fabric code output for Load_HoldingsFact is not available, so no validation of logic, structure, or business rule equivalence can be performed.

3. **Optimization Suggestions**

No optimization suggestions can be provided, as the converted Fabric code for Load_HoldingsFact is not present. Recommendations require access to the actual code implementation.

4. **Overall Assessment**

The review cannot be completed because the converted Fabric code for Load_HoldingsFact is missing. Only the original Synapse stored procedure and related documentation for a different process (LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY) are available.

5. **Recommendations**

- Please provide the actual converted Fabric code (PySpark or Fabric SQL) for Load_HoldingsFact so that a complete review, validation, and optimization assessment can be performed.
- Once the converted code is available, unit tests and Pytest scripts can be generated to validate correctness and output reconciliation.
- Ensure that future submissions include both the original and converted code for the process under review.

6. **API Cost Estimation**

API Cost: 0.0084 USD

**Note:** No test cases or Pytest scripts can be generated, and no reconciliation framework can be provided until the actual converted Fabric code for Load_HoldingsFact is available. Please supply the required code to proceed with the review.
