The required Python reconciliation framework cannot be generated because the actual converted Fabric SQL (or PySpark) code for Load_HoldingsFact is missing from all available files. Only the Synapse stored procedure and documentation/analysis are present. Please provide the actual Fabric code output so that the complete reconciliation script can be generated as requested.
