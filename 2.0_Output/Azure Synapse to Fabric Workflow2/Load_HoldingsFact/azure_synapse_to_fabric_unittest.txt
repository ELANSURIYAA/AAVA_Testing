The required converted Fabric code for "Load_HoldingsFact.txt" is not present in the available files or knowledge base. Please provide the actual Fabric code (Python, PySpark, or Fabric SQL) resulting from the Synapse-to-Fabric conversion so that I can generate comprehensive unit test cases and a corresponding Pytest script as per your specifications. No API cost incurred for test generation due to missing input.
