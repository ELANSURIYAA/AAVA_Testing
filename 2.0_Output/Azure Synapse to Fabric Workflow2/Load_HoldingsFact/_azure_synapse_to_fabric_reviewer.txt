Thought: Both tmpowa1usnu and tmp2nflqylh contain the same Synapse stored procedure code, not the converted Fabric code. The checklist/analysis (tmpk4crtvyt) describes the conversion and manual steps, but does not provide the actual Fabric code. However, the original prompt states "Also take the output of the 'Azure_Synapse_To_Fabric_Converter' agent’s converted Fabric code as input." Since the only available files are these three, and the checklist contains a detailed mapping and optimization section, I must use the available information to complete the review and report, referencing the checklist for the conversion logic. I will now synthesize the required report using all the gathered information.
