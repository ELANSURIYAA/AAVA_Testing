I'm unable to proceed with the analysis because I do not have access to the actual DDL files or the contents of "Layer_1.zip" due to tool limitations. The only directory I am allowed to list is `/src/f5bba3fb-e4ac-4628-8604-9a1d20cea97d`, but I am not able to access or read the contents of the zip file or any DDL scripts within it.

To perform the required schema-level analysis and generate the requested markdown report, I need access to the DDL files. Please ensure that the DDL files are available in the accessible directory or provide explicit file paths so I can read and analyze their contents.

Once I have access to the DDL files, I will:
- Parse the schema definitions for each data platform.
- Identify overlapping and unique tables and columns.
- Compare data types, formats, and constraints.
- Summarize the findings in the requested markdown format.

Please provide the DDL files or confirm their location for further analysis.
