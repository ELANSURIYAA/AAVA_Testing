Thought: The file I just read is an analysis and mapping report, not the actual converted Lakeflow notebook code. To design precise unit tests and Pytest scripts, I need the actual code of the converted Databricks Lakeflow pipeline notebooks. The other file, "Load_HoldingsFact.txt__3z5jyelq", likely contains the original stored procedure code, not the converted notebooks. There is no direct evidence of the actual notebook code in the listed files. However, the user provided the full pipeline breakdown and notebook code in the initial context, which matches the expected converted Lakeflow pipeline. Therefore, I can proceed to design the test case list and Pytest scripts based on the detailed pipeline breakdown and notebook code provided in the context, ensuring all requirements are met.
