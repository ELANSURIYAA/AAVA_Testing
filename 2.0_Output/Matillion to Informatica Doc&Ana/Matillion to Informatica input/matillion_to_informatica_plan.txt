1. Cost Estimation

Informatica Runtime Cost

- Breakdown:
  - The Matillion job reads a CSV (~2TB for CUSTOMER_MTH is the largest, but the sample job suggests a single file load, likely smaller, e.g., 100GB as per MACOMMON._GEOCODE_WEEKLY or 200GB as per TAMBR_RINGS).
  - Transformation steps are simple: filter on "status" and rename a column.
  - Bulk load to Snowflake is used, which is efficient and minimizes compute time.
  - Informatica on Databricks is priced at $0.15–$0.75 per DBU-hour.
  - For a 100GB–200GB file, a typical bulk load and simple transformation job would take 0.5–2 hours depending on cluster size and throughput.

- Calculation Example:
  - Assume 1 hour of compute for 200GB (upper bound), at $0.75/DBU-hour (upper bound for enterprise).
  - If the job uses a 4-DBU cluster: 4 DBUs × 1 hour × $0.75 = $3.00 per run.

- Key Cost Drivers:
  - Data volume (size of CSV to process and load).
  - Cluster size (number of DBUs provisioned).
  - Job duration (affected by transformation complexity and data size).
  - Since transformations are simple (filter, rename), compute cost is minimal.
  - Bulk loading is efficient, so most cost is from reading/writing data.

- Informatica Runtime Cost Estimate: **$3.00 USD per 200GB file load (using 4 DBUs for 1 hour at $0.75/DBU-hour).**

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort

- Syntax Differences & Manual Intervention:
  - Matillion JSON uses declarative task definitions; Informatica requires mapping to its workflow and transformation objects.
  - File read and bulk load steps map directly, but transformation logic (filter, rename) must be implemented in Informatica's Expression/Filter/Mapping Designer.
  - Variable handling (source_file_path, etc.) must be mapped to Informatica parameters/variables.
  - No custom SQL/scripts, so no complex translation needed.

- Estimated Manual Fixes:
  - Mapping tasks to Informatica objects: 1 hour.
  - Implementing filter and rename: 0.5 hour.
  - Setting up variables and parameters: 0.5 hour.
  - Testing and debugging mapping: 1 hour.
  - Total for code fixes and unit testing: **3 hours**.

Output Validation Effort

- Comparing outputs:
  - Run both Matillion and Informatica jobs on the same input.
  - Export outputs and perform row/column comparison.
  - Handle edge cases (e.g., missing/extra rows, data type mismatches).
  - Debug any discrepancies.

- Estimated Validation Effort:
  - Output extraction and comparison: 1 hour.
  - Debugging discrepancies: 1 hour.
  - Total for output validation: **2 hours**.

Total Estimated Effort (in hours): **5 hours**

- Justification:
  - The job is simple (filter, rename, bulk load).
  - No complex transformations, window functions, or joins.
  - Most effort is in mapping JSON structure to Informatica mappings and validating outputs.
  - Edge case handling is minimal due to straightforward logic.

**Summary Table**

| Category                      | Estimate                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Informatica Runtime Cost      | $3.00 USD per 200GB file load |
| Manual Fixes & Unit Testing   | 3 hours                       |
| Output Validation Effort      | 2 hours                       |
| Total Testing Effort          | 5 hours                       |
| API Cost                      | apiCost: 0.0 USD              |

**Key Influencing Factors:**
- Data volume (larger files increase runtime cost).
- Transformation complexity (more complex logic increases manual effort).
- Informatica environment (cluster size, DBU rate).
- The simplicity of the job (no advanced transformations or scripts) keeps both cost and effort low.

**Areas Requiring Manual Intervention:**
- Mapping Matillion JSON tasks to Informatica mappings.
- Implementing filter and rename logic in Informatica.
- Setting up variables/parameters.
- Validating output equivalence.
