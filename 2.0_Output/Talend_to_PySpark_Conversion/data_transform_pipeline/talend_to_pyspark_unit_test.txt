Thought: The file I just read is an analyzer output and not the actual PySpark code. I need to check if the actual PySpark code is present in another file, possibly data_transform_pipeline.java__rsstraqy, or if there is a .py file. Since the user provided the PySpark code in their prompt, I can proceed to generate the test cases and Pytest script based on that code. However, I must follow the instruction to show the repo name, branch name, and API token input prompt for uploading the test file, as well as use the DI_Github_File_Writer tool for the upload. I will now prepare the test case list and the Pytest script, and prompt the user for their repo, branch, and token.
