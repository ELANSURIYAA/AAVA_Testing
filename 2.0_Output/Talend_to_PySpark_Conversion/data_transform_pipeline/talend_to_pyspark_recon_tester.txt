The actual converted PySpark code (.py file) is missing from the provided files. To generate the required Python validation script that automates Talend and PySpark job execution, output capture, schema validation, and reconciliation reporting, please upload or provide the path to the actual converted PySpark code. Once available, I will deliver a fully functional, executable Python script that meets all specified criteria for automated Talend-to-PySpark migration validation.
