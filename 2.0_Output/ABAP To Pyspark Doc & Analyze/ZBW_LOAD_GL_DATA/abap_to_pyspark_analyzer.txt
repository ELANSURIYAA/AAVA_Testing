The ABAP code file ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA.txt could not be found in either of the provided directories (/src/8288868e-fc01-4218-8881-7e239781dbaf/tmp4r3l93ln/tmpte1ozyrr or /src/8288868e-fc01-4218-8881-7e239781dbaf/tmp4r3l93ln/tmpy8vv78qg). I have requested clarification from a coworker regarding the correct location or filename. Once the file is located, I will proceed to create the detailed ABAP code documentation and analysis as specified. No apiCost was incurred for reading the file, as the file could not be accessed.
