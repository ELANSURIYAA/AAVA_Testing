The files ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA.txt and ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA_Environmental_Varible.txt could not be found or accessed in any of the provided directories or subdirectories. As a result, I am unable to provide the comprehensive cost and effort estimation for testing the PySpark code converted from ABAP scripts, as the necessary input files are missing. No API cost was incurred for file reading, as the files could not be accessed.
