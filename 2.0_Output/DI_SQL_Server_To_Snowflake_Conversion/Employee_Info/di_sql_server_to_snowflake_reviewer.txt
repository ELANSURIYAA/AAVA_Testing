Summary
The review could not be completed because the original SQL code (Employee_Info.txt) was not found in the directory. Without access to the original SQL script, it is not possible to analyze, compare, or validate the accuracy and completeness of the Snowflake-compatible SQL query.

Conversion Accuracy

Discrepancies and Issues

- No comparison or validation could be performed.

Optimization Suggestions
- Ensure the original SQL code file is available in the directory for a complete review.

Overall Assessment
