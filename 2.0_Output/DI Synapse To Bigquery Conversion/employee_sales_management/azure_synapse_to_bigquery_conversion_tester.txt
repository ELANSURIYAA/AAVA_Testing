Description:   Loads sales fact table with data quality validation and audit logging in BigQuery
=============================================

Transformation Change Detection

**Expression Transformation Mapping:**
- Azure Synapse uses `NEWID()` for batch ID; BigQuery uses `GENERATE_UUID()`.
- Azure Synapse uses `SYSDATETIME()` for timestamps; BigQuery uses `CURRENT_DATETIME()`.
- Azure Synapse uses `OBJECT_NAME(@@PROCID)` for procedure name; BigQuery assigns manually.
- Azure Synapse uses `@@ROWCOUNT`; BigQuery uses explicit `SELECT COUNT(*)`.
- Azure Synapse uses `CAST(s.Sales_Date AS DATE)`; BigQuery uses `DATE(s.Sales_Date)`.
- Temporary tables (`#InvalidRows`) in Synapse are replaced by CTEs in BigQuery.

**Aggregator Transformations:**
- Both use `COUNT(*)` for row counts, but BigQuery does so via CTEs.
- No GROUP BY or window functions required for this workflow.

**Join Strategies:**
- INNER JOINs for dimension lookups are preserved.
- LEFT JOIN used for filtering out invalid rows in BigQuery.

**Data Type Transformations:**
- `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` → `STRING`
- `DATETIME` → `DATETIME`
- `NVARCHAR` → `STRING`
- `BIGINT`/`INT` → `INT64`

**Null Handling and Case Sensitivity Adjustments:**
- Explicit checks for `Customer_ID IS NULL` and `Quantity <= 0` are preserved.
- BigQuery may require careful handling of NULLs in string concatenation.

Recommended Manual Interventions

- **Audit Table Schema:** Ensure audit and DQ_Failures tables are compatible with BigQuery types.
- **Error Handling:** Confirm BigQuery exception handling covers all error scenarios.
- **Performance:** Consider partitioning/clustering for `Fact_Sales` table.
- **Edge Cases:** Validate that all invalid data is captured and logged.
- **String Manipulation:** Ensure `CONCAT` in BigQuery handles NULLs as expected.
- **Monitoring:** Update external monitoring to capture BigQuery procedure errors.

Test Case List:
| Test Case ID | Test Case Description | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| TC01 | Valid sales transaction is loaded into Fact_Sales | Row appears in Fact_Sales, not in DQ_Failures |
| TC02 | Transaction with NULL Customer_ID is rejected | Row appears in DQ_Failures with reason 'Missing CustomerID', not in Fact_Sales |
| TC03 | Transaction with Quantity <= 0 is rejected | Row appears in DQ_Failures with reason 'Invalid Quantity', not in Fact_Sales |
| TC04 | Audit_Log entry is created at start and completed at end | Audit_Log has 'STARTED' and 'COMPLETED' entries for batch |
| TC05 | Batch_ID is generated as UUID and propagated | Batch_ID is a valid UUID in all target tables |
| TC06 | Error in dimension lookup (missing Customer_ID in Dim_Customer) | Transaction is not loaded into Fact_Sales, error logged if applicable |
| TC07 | All invalid rows are deleted from staging after procedure | stg.Sales_Transactions contains only valid rows post-procedure |
| TC08 | Procedure fails gracefully and logs error in Audit_Log | Audit_Log status is 'FAILED' and error message is captured |
| TC09 | Total_Sales_Amount calculation is correct | Total_Sales_Amount = Quantity * Unit_Price for loaded rows |
| TC10 | Load_Timestamp and Batch_ID are correctly assigned | All loaded rows have non-null Load_Timestamp and Batch_ID |
