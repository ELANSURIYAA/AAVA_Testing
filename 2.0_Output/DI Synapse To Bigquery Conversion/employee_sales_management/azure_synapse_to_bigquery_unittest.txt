Thought: The file I just read contains the original Synapse stored procedure (employee_sales_management.txt), not the converted BigQuery code. The user provided the BigQuery code in the context above, which is the actual conversion of this Synapse procedure. I now have all the information needed to design the test cases and Pytest script based on the provided BigQuery code. I will proceed to generate the required output.
