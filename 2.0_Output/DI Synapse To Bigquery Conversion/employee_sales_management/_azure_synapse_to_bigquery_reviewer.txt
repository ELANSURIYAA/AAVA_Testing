Thought: The knowledge base retrieval returned no additional content, but from the context and previous observations, I have all the required information: the original Synapse stored procedure, the detailed conversion review (including mapping, optimization, and manual adjustment notes), and the BigQuery SQL code and test suite as provided in the context. I can now synthesize the required review report with all mandatory metadata sections.

Action: none (ready to answer)
