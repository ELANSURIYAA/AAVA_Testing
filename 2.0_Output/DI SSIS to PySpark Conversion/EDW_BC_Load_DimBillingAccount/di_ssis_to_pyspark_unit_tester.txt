Thought: The file DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer.txt__i865x0id contains only documentation and analysis of the SSIS package and its conversion requirements, not the actual converted PySpark code. The actual PySpark code was provided in the user message as context, so I can use that for designing the unit tests and Pytest scripts. I now have all the necessary transformation logic and schema from the context. I will proceed to design the test case list and write the comprehensive Pytest scripts as required, ensuring to include the metadata at the top and the API cost consumed.
