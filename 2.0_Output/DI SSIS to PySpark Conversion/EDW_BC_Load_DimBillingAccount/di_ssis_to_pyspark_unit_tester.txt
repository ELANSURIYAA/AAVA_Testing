Thought: The DI_SSIS_to_PySpark_Analyzer.txt__0xukv9qs file contains only documentation and analysis, not the actual PySpark code. The actual PySpark code is likely in the original user-provided context, which was pasted in the prompt. I have all the PySpark transformation logic needed for test case design and implementation. I will now design the test case list and write the Pytest scripts for the transformation logic, ensuring all requirements are met.
