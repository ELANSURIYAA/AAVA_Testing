Thought: I have now read the original SSIS package logic and already have the complete migrated PySpark script from the context. I can now perform a detailed review and validation, mapping each SSIS step to its PySpark equivalent, checking for conversion accuracy, discrepancies, optimization, and overall assessment. I will include the required metadata only once at the top and provide the full review report as requested.
