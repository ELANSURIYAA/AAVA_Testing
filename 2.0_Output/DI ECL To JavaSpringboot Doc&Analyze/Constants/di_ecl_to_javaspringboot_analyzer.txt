Description:   Defines reusable constants for ECL scripts, standardizing status values and join limits.
=============================================

## 1. Complexity Metrics

- **Total line count of the ECL script:** 5
- **Number of datasets (via DATASET or IMPORT statements) used:** 0
- **Count and types of TRANSFORMs defined:** 0
- **Number of JOINs, including join kinds (INNER, LEFT, etc.):** 0
- **Count of PROJECT, SORT, DEDUP, ROLLUP operations:** 0
- **Number of nested modules or subgraphs (child workflows):** 0
- **Count of OUTPUT or STORE operations:** 0
- **Number of conditional constructs (IF, CASE, inline filters):** 0
- **Number of reusable components (MACROs, FUNCTIONs, etc.):** 1 (the module itself)
- **Conversion Complexity Score:** 2/100  
  _Explanation:_ This script is extremely simple; it only exports two constant values in a module. There are no data operations, transformations, or control flow constructs.

## 2. Feature Compatibility Check with Java Spring Boot

- **Implicit schema typing and RECORD definitions:**  
  Not present in this script; only constants are defined.

- **Dataset-level operations like ROLLUP, NORMALIZE, and DENORMALIZE:**  
  Not present; no dataset operations exist.

- **Global aggregates using AGGREGATE with GROUP clauses:**  
  Not present.

- **Stateless vs. stateful transformations in ECL that need code-based handling in Spring Boot:**  
  Not applicable; the module is stateless and only provides static values.

- **Other ECL constructs that don’t directly map to Java Spring Boot:**  
  - The ECL `EXPORT` module pattern does not directly map to Java, but can be represented as a Java class with `public static final` fields.
  - No dynamic or runtime logic to consider.

---

## 3. Manual Adjustments for Java Spring Boot Migration

- **Renaming variable names to follow Java naming conventions:**  
  - `NotFoundStatus` → `NOT_FOUND_STATUS` (if using constants in Java)
  - `MaxJoinLimit` → `MAX_JOIN_LIMIT`

- **Refactoring dataset or record names to meaningful Java class names:**  
  - `Constants` module → `Constants` Java class

- **Adjusting data types:**  
  - `STRING` → `String`
  - `INTEGER` → `int`

- **Moving hardcoded values to config files or environment variables:**  
  - Consider moving `MaxJoinLimit` to `application.properties` or environment variables for flexibility.
  - `NotFoundStatus` could also be externalized if it may change.

- **Converting control flow statements:**  
  - Not applicable (no control flow).

- **Adding exception handling for runtime safety:**  
  - Not required for static constants, but downstream usage should include error handling.

- **Injecting dependencies using @Autowired or constructor injection:**  
  - Not required for static constants.

- **Routing output logic to appropriate Spring components:**  
  - Not applicable; this is a utility class.

## 4. Optimization Recommendations for Java Spring Boot

- **Use of pagination, batching, and multi-threaded processing for large datasets:**  
  - Not applicable for constants.

- **Incorporating caching (e.g., with Spring Cache) for repeatable logic:**  
  - Not needed for static constants.

- **Structuring services into clean layers (Controller, Service, Repository):**  
  - Place the constants in a dedicated utility or configuration package for clarity.

- **Performance tuning options with thread pools, asynchronous execution, and profiling:**  
  - Not applicable.

- **Externalizing configuration for dynamic schema or data source handling:**  
  - For greater flexibility, consider externalizing `MaxJoinLimit` and `NotFoundStatus` to configuration files.

**Summary:**  
This ECL module is extremely simple and migration-ready. The only manual work required is to convert the ECL module to a Java class with static constant fields, optionally externalizing values to configuration. No complex refactoring or workflow redesign is needed. This file poses no significant migration or compatibility challenges for Java Spring Boot.
