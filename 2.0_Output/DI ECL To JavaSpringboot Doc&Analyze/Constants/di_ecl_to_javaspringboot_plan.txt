Description: Provides a cost and effort estimation for migrating the Constants.ecl ECL module to Java Springboot, including runtime cost, manual code adjustment, and data recon testing.
=============================================

# 1. Java Springboot Runtime Cost

Since the original ECL module (`Constants.ecl`) only defines and exports two constants (`NotFoundStatus` and `MaxJoinLimit`) and does not process any data, perform queries, or interact with datasets, the runtime cost for running the converted Java Springboot code is effectively **zero**. 

- **EC2 Instance Usage:** No data processing or compute workload is involved for static constants. The constants would be loaded into memory when the Java application starts, incurring only a negligible fraction of a cent for memory usage, which is typically absorbed in the baseline cost of running any Java Springboot service.
- **Data Volume:** No datasets are read, written, or processed.
- **Number of Queries:** None.
- **Temporary Tables:** None.
- **Cost Justification:** The only cost would be the baseline cost of keeping a Java Springboot service running, but for a constants utility class, this is not measurable as a separate cost. If the constants are part of a larger service, their contribution to runtime cost is negligible.

**Estimated Java Springboot Runtime Cost: $0.00**

# 2. Code Fixing for Manual Interventions and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation

- **Manual Code Fixing Effort:** 
  - Renaming variables to Java conventions (e.g., `NOT_FOUND_STATUS`, `MAX_JOIN_LIMIT`)
  - Adjusting data types (`String`, `int`)
  - Refactoring the ECL module to a Java class with `public static final` fields
  - Optionally externalizing constants to a configuration file (e.g., `application.properties`)
  - No control flow or logic to convert

  **Estimated effort: 0.5 to 1 hour**

- **Data Recon Testing Effort:**
  - Verifying the constants are correctly set and accessible in Java
  - No data processing, so only basic value checks are needed

  **Estimated effort: 0.25 hour**

**Total Effort for Manual Code Fixes and Data Recon Testing: 0.75 to 1.25 hours**

# 3. API Cost

The cost consumed by the API for this estimation task is **$0.00**.
