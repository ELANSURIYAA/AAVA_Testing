The required schema module (schema.py) and the main converted PySpark pipeline script are missing from the provided directory. Only auto-generated PySpark transformation functions (from .xfr files) are present. Without these mandatory files, it is not possible to generate the comprehensive Python orchestration script for end-to-end reconciliation and validation as requested. Please provide the missing schema module and the main PySpark pipeline script to proceed.
