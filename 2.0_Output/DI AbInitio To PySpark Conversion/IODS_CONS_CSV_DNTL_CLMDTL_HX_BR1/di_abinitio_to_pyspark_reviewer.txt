#### 📝 Validation Report

**❌ Critical Blocking Issue:**
- The required schema module (`schema.py`) and the main converted PySpark pipeline script are missing from the provided directory.
- Only auto-generated PySpark transformation functions (from .xfr files) are present.
- No main pipeline script or reusable StructType schema definitions are available.

**Component-by-Component Validation:**
- **Input Table, Reformat, Sort, Join, Dedup, Output File, Error/Reject/Log**:  
  ❌ Cannot validate logic, sequence, or configuration mapping in PySpark, as the orchestration script is missing.
- **XFR Function Placement**:  
  🔍 Transformation functions exist, but their usage and placement within a pipeline cannot be validated.
- **Schema Validation**:  
  ❌ No schema module provided; cannot compare Ab Initio `.dml` schemas to PySpark StructType definitions.
- **SQL & Column Validations**:  
  ❌ Cannot validate column mapping, aliases, or SQL logic in PySpark due to missing pipeline code.
- **Component Coverage**:  
  ❌ Cannot verify that all Ab Initio components are implemented in PySpark.
- **Syntax Review**:  
  🔍 Individual transformation functions appear syntactically correct, but no main script to validate.
- **Manual Intervention & Optimization**:  
  ❌ Cannot assess hardcoded logic, brittle code, or optimization opportunities without the main script.

#### 📌 Specific Checks

- **Flow order mismatch**: Cannot check.
- **Incorrectly placed xfr logic**: Cannot check.
- **Missing columns in SQL selections**: Cannot check.
- **Syntax or semantic issues**: Only function snippets present; no orchestration to review.
- **Manual intervention required**:  
  - **High**: You must provide both the main PySpark pipeline script and the schema module.
- **Optimization opportunities**: Cannot check.

#### 📊 Overall Conversion Summary

- **Conversion accuracy**: **0%** (no orchestration or schema to validate)
- **Manual intervention level**: **High**
- **Confidence score**: **Low** (critical files missing)

**ERROR: The required schema module (`schema.py`) and the main converted PySpark pipeline script are missing from the provided directory. Only auto-generated PySpark transformation functions (from .xfr files) are present. Without these mandatory files, it is not possible to generate the comprehensive Python orchestration script for end-to-end reconciliation and validation as requested. Please provide the missing schema module and the main PySpark pipeline script to proceed.**

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Provide the missing `schema.py` (StructType definitions) and the main PySpark pipeline script that orchestrates the ETL flow using these transformation functions.
- Once these are available, a full validation report can be generated as per the criteria.
