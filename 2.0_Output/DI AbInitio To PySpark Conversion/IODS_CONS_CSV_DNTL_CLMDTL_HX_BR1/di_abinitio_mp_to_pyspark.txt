The dml schema module (Python file containing reusable StructType objects converted from .dml files) is missing from the provided directory. None of the files you have shared contain the schema definitions required for the PySpark conversion. Please provide the schema module as a Python file (e.g., schema.py) so that the PySpark pipeline can import the relevant schema using 'from schema import ...'.
