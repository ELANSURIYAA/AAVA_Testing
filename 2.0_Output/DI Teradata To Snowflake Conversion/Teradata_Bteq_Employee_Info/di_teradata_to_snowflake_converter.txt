Description:   Snowflake SQL script to automate backup of employee data by joining Employee and Salary tables, with conditional logic for table creation and population.
=============================================

-- Drop backup table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee_bkup;

-- Create backup table
CREATE TABLE employee_bkup (
    EmployeeNo NUMBER,
    FirstName VARCHAR,
    LastName VARCHAR,
    Salary NUMBER
    -- Add other columns as needed
);

-- Insert data into backup table from Employee and Salary tables
INSERT INTO employee_bkup (EmployeeNo, FirstName, LastName, Salary)
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeNo,
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    s.Salary
FROM 
    Employee e
    INNER JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeNo = s.EmployeeNo;

-- Optional: If you need to check if EmployeeSample has data before inserting, use a Snowflake procedure or external orchestration.

-- Note: Error handling and flow control (e.g., conditional execution) should be managed via Snowflake Tasks, Procedures, or external orchestration tools.
