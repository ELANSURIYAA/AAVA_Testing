| IngestionTimestamp  | Timestamp when the record was ingested.                          | Timestamp   |

**Entity: ContactInfo**
- Description: Represents the contact information (address, phone, email) for a Member.

| Column Name         | Description                                                      | Data Type   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Address             | Physical address of the member. (PII)                            | String      |
| Phone               | Phone number of the member. (PII)                                | String      |

**Entity: Language**
- Description: Represents the languages spoken and written by a Member.

| Column Name         | Description                                                      | Data Type   |

| Spoken              | List of languages spoken by the member.                          | Array       |
| Written             | Primary language in which the member is literate.                | String      |

3. Relationships Between Tables:
- Each Member has exactly one ContactInfo and one Language record (1:1 relationship).
- Member to ContactInfo: One-to-one (each member has unique contact info).
- Member to Language: One-to-one (each member has unique language profile).

4. Rationale for Key Design Decisions and Assumptions:
- Primary and foreign key fields are excluded as per instructions.
- PII fields are marked based on their direct ability to identify or contact an individual (DOB, Address, Phone, Email).
- All attributes are required and non-null, as per constraints.
- The logical model separates demographic, contact, and language information for modularity, clarity, and compliance.
- Data types are chosen based on observed data and attribute definitions.
- Relationships are 1:1, reflecting the business rule that each member has unique contact and language data.
