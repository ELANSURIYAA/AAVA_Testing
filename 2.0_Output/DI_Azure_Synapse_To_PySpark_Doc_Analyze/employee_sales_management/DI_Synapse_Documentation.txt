Thought: The input is a SQL stored procedure (dw.sp_load_sales_fact) used in Azure Synapse for loading and transforming sales fact data from a staging table to a fact table, with audit logging and data quality checks. I have all the required details to generate the requested Markdown documentation, including code structure, data flow, mapping, transformation logic, complexity analysis, and outputs. No additional information or clarification is needed from coworkers.
