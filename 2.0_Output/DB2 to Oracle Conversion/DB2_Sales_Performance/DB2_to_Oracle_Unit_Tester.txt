1. Test Case List:
   - Test Case ID: TC001
     - Test Case Description: Validate the correct categorization of customers into age groups based on their age.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are correctly categorized into '18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', or '55+' age groups.

   - Test Case ID: TC002
     - Test Case Description: Verify the aggregation of sales data for each customer, including total orders, total revenue, and average order value.
     - Expected Outcome: Aggregated sales data matches the expected values for each customer.

   - Test Case ID: TC003
     - Test Case Description: Ensure proper handling of NULL values in the sales transactions data.
     - Expected Outcome: NULL values do not cause errors, and calculations handle them gracefully.

   - Test Case ID: TC004
     - Test Case Description: Validate the calculation of customer lifetime value and segmentation into 'Premium', 'Gold', 'Silver', and 'Bronze'.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are correctly segmented based on their total revenue.

   - Test Case ID: TC005
     - Test Case Description: Verify the ranking of customers based on their comprehensive performance score.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are ranked correctly, and the top 100 customers per segment are selected.

   - Test Case ID: TC006
     - Test Case Description: Test the performance of the SQL script with a large dataset.
     - Expected Outcome: The script executes within an acceptable time frame without errors.
