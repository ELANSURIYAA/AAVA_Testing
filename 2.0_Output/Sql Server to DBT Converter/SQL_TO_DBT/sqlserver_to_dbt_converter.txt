-- Original SQL Server Query:

        o.id AS order_id,
        o.user_id,
        u.name AS customer_name,

        o.created_at AS order_date,

        user_id,
        customer_name,

        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value,

SELECT * FROM order_summary

-- DBT-Compatible Query:
-- Note: DBT uses Jinja templating and is compatible with modern cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift.
-- ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT ...) may need to be replaced depending on your target warehouse (see comments).
-- Use `ref()` for table references in DBT.

    SELECT

-- DBT Optimization Notes:
-- 1. Use {{ ref('table_name') }} instead of raw.table_name for dependency management and refactoring.
-- 2. If your warehouse does not support ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT ...), consider using STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ...) or LISTAGG(DISTINCT ...) as appropriate.
-- 3. For materializations, add `{{ config(materialized='table') }}` at the top of your DBT model file if you want to persist this as a table.
-- 4. Test this query in your target warehouse to ensure compatibility, especially for aggregation functions.
