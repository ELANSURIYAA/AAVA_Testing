-- Original SQL Server Query:

        o.user_id,
        u.name AS customer_name,

        o.total_amount,
        o.created_at AS order_date,
        p.category AS product_category,
        p.price AS product_price
    FROM raw.orders o

        user_id,
        customer_name,

        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT product_category) AS categories_bought

SELECT * FROM order_summary
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- DBT-Compatible Query:
-- Note: DBT compiles SQL for the target data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift). 
-- ARRAY_AGG is supported in BigQuery and Snowflake, but for Redshift, use LISTAGG. 
-- The following example assumes Snowflake or BigQuery. For Redshift, replace ARRAY_AGG with LISTAGG.

-- DBT-specific changes:
-- 1. Replaced raw table references with {{ ref('table_name') }} for DBT model referencing.
-- 2. ARRAY_AGG is supported in BigQuery/Snowflake. For Redshift, use LISTAGG.
-- 3. No SQL Server-specific functions were present; the query is largely compatible except for table referencing and aggregation syntax.
-- 4. Consider materializing this query as a table or view in DBT by setting `materialized='table'` or `materialized='view'` in the model config block.
-- 5. For performance, consider clustering or partitioning on user_id if supported by your data warehouse.

-- Example DBT config block (add at top of your .sql file if needed):
-- {{ config(materialized='table') }}

-- Test this query in your DBT environment to ensure expected results.
