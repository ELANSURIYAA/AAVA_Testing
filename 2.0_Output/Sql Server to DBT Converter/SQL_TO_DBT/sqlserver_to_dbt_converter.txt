-- Original SQL Server Query:
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT
        o.id AS order_id,
        o.user_id,
        u.name AS customer_name,
        u.email AS customer_email,
        o.total_amount,
        o.created_at AS order_date,
        p.category AS product_category,
        p.price AS product_price
    FROM raw.orders o
    JOIN raw.users u ON o.user_id = u.id
    JOIN raw.order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
    JOIN raw.products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
),

order_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        customer_name,
        customer_email,
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT product_category) AS categories_bought
    FROM customer_orders
    GROUP BY user_id, customer_name, customer_email
)

SELECT * FROM order_summary
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- DBT-Compatible Query:
-- Note: DBT uses the SQL dialect of your target data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.). 
-- ARRAY_AGG is not available in SQL Server, but is available in BigQuery and Snowflake (as ARRAY_AGG or ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT ...)).
-- For Redshift, use LISTAGG for string aggregation.
-- Below is a version compatible with BigQuery/Snowflake. Adjust aggregation function for your warehouse if needed.

-- DBT-specific changes:
-- 1. Use {{ ref('table_name') }} to reference source tables, enabling DBT lineage and dependency tracking.
-- 2. ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT ...) is supported in BigQuery and Snowflake. For Redshift, replace with LISTAGG(DISTINCT ...).
-- 3. Ensure your source tables (orders, users, order_items, products) are defined as DBT models or sources.
-- 4. Consider materializing this model as a table or view in your dbt_project.yml for performance optimization.
-- 5. Test this query in your target DBT environment to ensure correct results.
