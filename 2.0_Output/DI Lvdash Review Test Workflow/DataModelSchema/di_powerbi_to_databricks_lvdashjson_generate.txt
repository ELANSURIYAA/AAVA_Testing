Both DataModelSchema.txt__77m855dh and Layout.txt__fauan06u cannot be read due to a 500 error: "An error occurred during file parsing: 'text'". This indicates the files are either not plain text (possibly binary, compressed, or encoded with an unsupported format), or are corrupted. The Read a file's content tool only supports plain text files.

To resolve this, please ensure both files are exported or converted to plain UTF-8 text format before attempting to read them with the current tools. If these files are Power BI artifacts (e.g., .pbix or embedded JSON/XML), extract their textual metadata first. Once the files are in plain text, the migration agent will be able to process them.

Until then, I cannot provide their content or proceed with migration. Please re-upload or convert the files and try again.
