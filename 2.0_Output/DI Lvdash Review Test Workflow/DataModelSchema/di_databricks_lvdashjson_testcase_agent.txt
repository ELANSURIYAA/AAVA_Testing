## Overall Assessment
All visuals from the sample dashboard are covered by atomic, deterministic test cases. Each field, aggregation, and filter is validated for correctness, including edge cases for nulls and empty datasets. Performance checks are included for visuals that may require expensive queries. Joins and relationships cannot be validated without the dimensional model (DataModelSchema.txt and Layout.txt) in plain text JSON format; please provide these files to enable full coverage and join validation.
