# Dashboard Test Plan

## Test Cases

| Test ID  | Visual ID   | Description | Expected Output | Severity | SQL Query |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| TC_001   | f6ea2185    | Validate pie chart: count of toss_decision by toss_decision category. | Each category shows count of toss_decision. | High | **Cannot generate: Data model schema missing.** |
| TC_002   | 19adc0e8    | Validate counter: count of unique venues. | Single value: count of distinct venue. | High | **Cannot generate: Data model schema missing.** |
| TC_003   | 3dc9a51d    | Validate pie chart: count of result by result category. | Each result category shows count of result. | High | **Cannot generate: Data model schema missing.** |
| TC_004   | 69be52d4    | Validate bar chart: count of id by winner. | Each winner shows count of id. | High | **Cannot generate: Data model schema missing.** |
| TC_005   | 73464d94    | Validate counter: total number of matches (count of id). | Single value: count of id. | High | **Cannot generate: Data model schema missing.** |

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 5  
- **High Severity**: 5  
- **Medium Severity**: 0  
- **Low Severity**: 0  

## Overall Assessment
**Test plan generation blocked.**  
The dashboard definition was parsed and all visuals identified. However, the required DataModelSchema.txt and Layout.txt files are not readable (parsing error, likely not plain text). As a result, field existence, data types, table names, joins, and aggregation logic cannot be validated, and executable SQL cannot be generated.

**Action Required:**  
- Re-export DataModelSchema.txt and Layout.txt as plain UTF-8 text files.
- Ensure all required files are present and accessible.
- Re-run the test plan generation once schema/model files are available.

**No SQL test cases can be generated until the data model and schema are available.**
