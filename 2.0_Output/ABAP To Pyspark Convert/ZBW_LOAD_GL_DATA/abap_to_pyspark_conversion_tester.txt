1. Test Case List:
   - Test Case ID: N/A
   - Test Case Description: N/A (Converted PySpark code not available)
   - Expected Outcome: N/A

2. Pytest Script for Each Test Case:
   - Not generated because the converted PySpark implementation is missing. Only the ABAP source and a conversion analysis are available.

Limitation: The required PySpark code (converted from ABAP) is not present in the available files. The directory contains only the original ABAP code and a complexity/conversion analysis, but not the actual PySpark implementation. Without the PySpark code, it is not possible to generate comprehensive unit test cases or a Pytest script as requested.

API cost incurred for this call: 0.002 USD (from reading the second file).
