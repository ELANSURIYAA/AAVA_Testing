1. The ABAP source code was found and read successfully.
2. The only other file available contains a complexity analysis and conversion notes, NOT the actual converted PySpark code.
3. Without the actual PySpark code, it is NOT possible to:
   - Perform syntax change detection between ABAP and PySpark
   - Recommend manual interventions specific to the PySpark implementation
   - Generate a comprehensive list of test cases or Pytest scripts that validate the correctness of the converted PySpark code
4. API cost consumed for this call: 0.004 USD

**Action Required:**  
Please provide the actual PySpark code that was converted from the ABAP program. Only then can I proceed with the requested analysis, test case list, and Pytest script generation.
