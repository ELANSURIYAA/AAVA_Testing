Test Case List:
No test cases can be generated because the converted PySpark output is not present in the provided files. Only the ABAP source code and a complexity/syntax analysis are available. Without the actual PySpark script, I cannot generate comprehensive unit test cases or a corresponding Pytest script.

Pytest Script for Each Test Case:
Not available, as the required PySpark code (converted from ABAP) is missing.

Cost consumed by the API for this call: minimal (directory and file read attempts only, no data processing performed).
