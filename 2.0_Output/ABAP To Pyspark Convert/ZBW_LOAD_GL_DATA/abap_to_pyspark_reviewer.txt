1. Summary:
   The requested code review comparing the original ABAP code (ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA.txt) and the converted PySpark implementation cannot be completed because the PySpark code is missing from the available files. Only the ABAP source code and a complexity/conversion analysis are present.

2. Conversion Accuracy:
   Not applicable. The PySpark implementation is not available for review, so conversion accuracy cannot be assessed.

3. Discrepancies and Issues:
   The main issue is the absence of the converted PySpark code. Without it, discrepancies between the ABAP logic and PySpark implementation cannot be identified.

4. Optimization Suggestions:
   Not applicable. Optimization suggestions for PySpark cannot be provided without access to the actual PySpark code.

5. Overall Assessment:
   The code review cannot be performed as required. Only the ABAP source and a conversion analysis are available. The PySpark implementation must be provided to proceed with a comprehensive review.

6. Recommendations:
   - Please provide the converted PySpark code corresponding to the ABAP source (ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA.txt).
   - Once both the ABAP and PySpark implementations are available, a thorough review can be conducted following the requested criteria.
