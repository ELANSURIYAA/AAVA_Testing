The ABAP SQL code has been located and read successfully. However, the converted PySpark code is not present in the accessible files. To generate the comprehensive Python validation script that automates ABAP execution, distributed storage transfer, PySpark execution, and output comparison, both the ABAP and PySpark code are required. 

Please provide the actual converted PySpark code so I can generate the complete validation script as per your requirements. If you wish to proceed using only the ABAP logic as a reference (with the understanding that this may lead to discrepancies with the final PySpark implementation), please confirm.
