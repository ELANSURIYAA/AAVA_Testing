The required PySpark code (converted from ABAP) is not present in the available files. The directory contains only the original ABAP code and a complexity/conversion analysis, but not the actual PySpark implementation. Without the PySpark code, it is not possible to generate comprehensive unit test cases or a Pytest script as requested.

API cost incurred for this call: 0.002 USD (from reading the second file).
