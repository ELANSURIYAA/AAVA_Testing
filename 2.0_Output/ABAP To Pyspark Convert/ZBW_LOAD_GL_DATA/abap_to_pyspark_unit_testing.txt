Test Case List and Pytest Script cannot be generated at this time because the actual PySpark code converted from ABAP is not present in the accessible files. Only the original ABAP code and a complexity analysis are available. To ensure comprehensive and accurate unit test coverage, the Pytest script and test cases must be based on the real PySpark implementation. 

API Cost Consumed:
- List files in directory: $0.00
- Read file content (tmpnpm41p9i): $0.002
- Read file content (tmpyunqgi3q): $0.002
- Ask coworker: $0.00
Total API cost: $0.004 USD

If you can provide the actual PySpark code, I will immediately generate the required test case list and Pytest script. If you wish to proceed using the ABAP logic as a reference, please confirm, understanding that this may lead to discrepancies with the final PySpark implementation.
