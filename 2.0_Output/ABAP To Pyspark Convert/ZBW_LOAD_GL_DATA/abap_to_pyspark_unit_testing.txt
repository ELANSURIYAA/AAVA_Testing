Test Case List:
- Test case generation and Pytest script implementation cannot proceed because the actual PySpark code (converted from ABAP) for the program "zload_finance_to_bw" is not present in the available files. The directory only contains the original ABAP code and a complexity analysis, but not the PySpark implementation.
- To fulfill the user's request, the actual PySpark code is required. Please provide the PySpark code or clarify its location.
