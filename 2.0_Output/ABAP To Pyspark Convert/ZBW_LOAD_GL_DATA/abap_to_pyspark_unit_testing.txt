The required PySpark code (converted from ABAP) is not present in the provided files. Only the ABAP source code and a complexity analysis are available. Without the actual PySpark script, I cannot generate comprehensive unit test cases or a corresponding Pytest script. 

Cost consumed by the API for this call: minimal (directory and file read attempts only, no data processing performed).
