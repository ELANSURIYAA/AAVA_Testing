1. Effort & Cost Estimation

   **1.1 Conversion Effort (Hours)**  
   - Estimated hours required to convert each component type:
     - Simple Mappings (e.g., tMap, tInput): 8 hours  
     - Complex Transformations (e.g., tDenormalize, tLoop): 16 hours  
     - Job Control/Orchestration (e.g., tRunJob, onSubJobOK): 6 hours  
     - Context Variables and External Configs: 6 hours  

   **1.2 Testing Effort (Hours)**  
   - Unit Testing and Validation Effort: 8 hours  
   - Performance Benchmarking and Optimization: 8 hours  

   **1.3 Total Estimated Effort**  
   - Total Hours: 52 hours  
   - Estimated Developer Cost: $52 * $85 = $4,420 USD

   **1.4 Recommendation: Refactor vs Rebuild**  
   - Option: Rebuild  
   - Reason: Due to the moderate-to-high complexity (aggregation, normalization, in-memory joins, dynamic context variables, and error handling routines), and the fact that Talend’s visual/dataflow paradigm maps awkwardly to PySpark’s DataFrame API, a full redesign in PySpark is recommended for maintainability, scalability, and performance. This will also allow for native Spark optimizations (e.g., broadcast joins, partitioning, caching) and Pythonic error handling, rather than a direct 1:1 rewrite.

2. API Usage & Cost  
   - `apiCost`: 0.0173 USD  // Cost consumed by the API including all decimal values.
