1. Effort & Cost Estimation

   **1.1 Conversion Effort (Hours)**  
   - Estimated hours required to convert each component type:
     - Simple Mappings (e.g., tMap, tInput): 6 hours  
     - Complex Transformations (e.g., tDenormalize, tLoop): 10 hours  
     - Job Control/Orchestration (e.g., tRunJob, onSubJobOK): 4 hours  
     - Context Variables and External Configs: 4 hours  

   **1.2 Testing Effort (Hours)**  
   - Unit Testing and Validation Effort: 6 hours  
   - Performance Benchmarking and Optimization: 6 hours  

   **1.3 Total Estimated Effort**  
   - Total Hours: 36 hours  
   - Estimated Developer Cost: $36 * 80 = $2880 USD

   **1.4 Recommendation: Refactor vs Rebuild**  
   - Option: Refactor  
   - Reason: The Talend job implements standard ETL logic (aggregation, normalization, lookup join, file output) without advanced Talend features (joblets, nested flows, dynamic schema). All transformations map directly to PySpark DataFrame operations. Moderate effort is needed for context/config translation and error handling, but a full redesign is not required.
