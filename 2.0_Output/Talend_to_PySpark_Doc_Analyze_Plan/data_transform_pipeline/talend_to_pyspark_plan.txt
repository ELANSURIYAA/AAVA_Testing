1. Effort & Cost Estimation

   **1.1 Conversion Effort (Hours)**  
   - Estimated hours required to convert each component type:
     - Simple Mappings (e.g., tMap, tInput): 8 hours  
     - Complex Transformations (e.g., tDenormalize, tLoop): 20 hours  
     - Job Control/Orchestration (e.g., tRunJob, onSubJobOK): 6 hours  
     - Context Variables and External Configs: 6 hours  

   **1.2 Testing Effort (Hours)**  
   - Unit Testing and Validation Effort: 8 hours  
   - Performance Benchmarking and Optimization: 8 hours  

   **1.3 Total Estimated Effort**  
   - Total Hours: 56 hours  
   - Estimated Developer Cost: $56 * $65 = $3640 USD

   **1.4 Recommendation: Refactor vs Rebuild**  
   - Option: Refactor  
   - Reason: The Talend job is straightforward, with clear mapping to PySpark DataFrame operations. Major logic (aggregation, normalization, join) maps directly to Spark APIs. Only context variable handling and error management require careful translation. No advanced orchestration or dynamic schema; a moderate refactor is sufficient for maintainability and performance.

2. API Usage & Cost  
   - `apiCost`: 0.0630 USD  // Cost consumed by the API including all decimal values.
