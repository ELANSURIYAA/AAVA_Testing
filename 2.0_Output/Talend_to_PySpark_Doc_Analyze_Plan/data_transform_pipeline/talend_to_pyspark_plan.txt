1. Effort & Cost Estimation

   **1.1 Conversion Effort (Hours)**  
   - Estimated hours required to convert each component type:
     - Simple Mappings (e.g., tMap, tInput): 8 hours  
     - Complex Transformations (e.g., tDenormalize, tLoop): 16 hours  
     - Job Control/Orchestration (e.g., tRunJob, onSubJobOK): 6 hours  
     - Context Variables and External Configs: 6 hours  

   **1.2 Testing Effort (Hours)**  
   - Unit Testing and Validation Effort: 8 hours  
   - Performance Benchmarking and Optimization: 8 hours  

   **1.3 Total Estimated Effort**  
   - Total Hours: 52 hours  
   - Estimated Developer Cost: $52 * $85 = $4420 USD

   **1.4 Recommendation: Refactor vs Rebuild**  
   - Option: Refactor  
   - Reason: The Talend job’s logic is straightforward (aggregation, normalization, join, output). It can be mapped directly to PySpark DataFrame operations with minimal transformation. No highly complex orchestration or dynamic schema detected.

2. API Usage & Cost  
   - `apiCost`: 0.0200 USD  // Cost consumed by the API including all decimal values.
