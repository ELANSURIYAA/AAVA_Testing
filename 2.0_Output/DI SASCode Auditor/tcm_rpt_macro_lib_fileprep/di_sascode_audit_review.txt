### Verification Summary
- Total audit rules in original table: 25
- Total audit rules evaluated by agent: 2
- Missing audit evaluations: 23
- Incorrect evaluations: 0

### Missing Evaluations
The following audit IDs from the original table were NOT evaluated by the previous agent:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

### Incorrect Evaluations
None. The two audits evaluated (IDs 1 and 2) are consistent with the SAS code and audit criteria:
- Audit 1 ("Standardized Query Execution") is marked as Passed, which is correct. The code uses standard SQL and avoids SAS-native functions in WHERE clauses.
- Audit 2 ("Access Verification via SASTRACE") is marked as Failed, which is correct. The SAS code does not contain the required `options sastrace=,,,d sastraceloc=saslog nostsuffix;` statement.

### Recommendation Quality
- Audit 1: Recommendation is "No update needed"—clear and appropriate for a passed rule.
- Audit 2: Recommendation is clear, specific, and actionable: "Add options sastrace=,,,d sastraceloc=saslog nostsuffix; for tracing Oracle query execution."
- No recommendations are present for the 23 missing audits.

### Overall Assessment
The previous agent only evaluated 2 out of 25 audit rules. The evaluations and recommendations for those 2 audits are accurate and clear. However, the validation is incomplete, as 23 audit rules were not checked at all. The review must be considered insufficient until all audit rules are evaluated against the SAS code.
