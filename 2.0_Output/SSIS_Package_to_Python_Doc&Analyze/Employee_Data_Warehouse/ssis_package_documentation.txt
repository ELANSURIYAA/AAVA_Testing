# Employee Data Warehouse SSIS Package Documentation

## 1. Overview of Package

**Purpose:**  
The Employee Data Warehouse SSIS package is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) employee-related data from operational source systems into a data warehouse. The package includes robust logging and error handling mechanisms to ensure traceability and reliability during execution.

**Alignment with Enterprise ETL:**  
This implementation aligns with enterprise data integration and ETL processes by:
- Centralizing employee data for analytics and reporting.
- Ensuring data quality through error logging.
- Supporting large-scale data movement (up to several terabytes).

**Business Problem & Benefits:**  
The package addresses the need for consolidated, reliable employee data for analytics, compliance, and business intelligence. Benefits include:
- Improved data accuracy.
- Enhanced reporting capabilities.
- Streamlined compliance and audit processes.

**High-Level SSIS Components:**
- **Control Flow:** Manages the sequence of tasks, including logging and error handling.
- **Data Flow:** (Details not available in provided files.)
- **Event Handlers:** Custom scripts for logging execution and errors.
- **Package Parameters:** Variables such as `LogFilePath`, `BatchID`, and `DestinationDBConnection`.

## 2. Package Structure and Design

**Structure:**  
The package includes:
- Script Tasks for execution logging and error logging.
- Use of SSIS variables for configuration and dynamic values.

**Key Components:**
- **Control Flow Tasks:** Script Tasks for logging and error handling.
- **Data Flow Components:** (Not detailed in provided files.)
- **Variables:** `LogFilePath`, `BatchID`, `DestinationDBConnection`, `System::ErrorDescription`.
- **Parameters:** As above.

**Primary SSIS Components:**
- **Connection Managers:** Used for database connections in logging scripts.
- **Containers, Transformations, Sources, Destinations:** (No explicit details provided.)
- **Dependencies:** External SQL Server for logging; variables for configuration.

## 3. Data Flow and Processing Logic

**Data Flow:**  
- Data is sourced from operational tables (EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, LOCATIONS).
- Data is loaded into data warehouse tables (EMPLOYEES_DW, HIGHSALARY_SUMMARY, LOWSALARY_SUMMARY).
- Error events are logged to SSIS_ERROR_LOG.

**Source & Destination Systems, Tables, Fields, Data Types:**  
- **Sources:** EMPLOYEES (1 TB), DEPARTMENTS (200 GB), LOCATIONS (200 GB).
- **Destinations:** EMPLOYEES_DW (2 TB), HIGHSALARY_SUMMARY (200 GB), LOWSALARY_SUMMARY (200 GB), SSIS_ERROR_LOG (50 GB).
- **Fields/Data Types:** (Not detailed in provided files.)

**Transformations:**  
- (No explicit transformation logic available.)
