Macro Name: (No explicit macro found in SAS code)

- Missing/Unconverted in Python: No explicit SAS macro found; all logic implemented as procedural steps.
- Remarks or Recommendations:
  - The SAS code does not define any %MACRO blocks. All logic is implemented as procedural steps (libname assignment, PROC SQL, DATA step, PROC EXPORT).
  - All major logic blocks (Teradata connection, SQL extraction and join, business rules, eligibility filtering, export to CSV) are present and implemented in the Python code.
  - The Python code replicates the SAS logic using functions and pandas, including:
    - Teradata connection (connect_to_teradata)
    - SQL extraction and join (extract_healthcare_data)
    - Business rules and eligibility logic (enrich_data)
    - Filtering eligible members (filter_eligible_members)
    - Export to CSV (export_to_csv)
  - No SAS-specific constructs such as RETAIN, LAG, FIRST., LAST., macro variables, or CALL EXECUTE are present in the SAS code, so none are missing in Python.
  - The only SAS macro usage is the %let statement for the output path, which is directly implemented as a variable in Python.
  - No placeholder comments or stubbed-out logic are present in the Python code.

Conclusion: There are no %MACRO definitions in the SAS code, so no macro logic is missing or unconverted in the Python code. All procedural logic is accounted for.
