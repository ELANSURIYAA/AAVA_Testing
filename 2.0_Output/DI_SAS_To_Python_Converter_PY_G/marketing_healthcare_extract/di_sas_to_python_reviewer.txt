Macro Name: (No macros defined in SAS code)
- Missing/Unconverted in Python: N/A
- Remarks or Recommendations:
  - The SAS code does not define any %MACROs. All logic is implemented as procedural steps.
  - All major steps (Teradata extraction, data enrichment with business rules, filtering eligible members, and CSV export) are represented in the Python code.
  - The Python code simulates data extraction and provider network join, applies business rules, filters eligible members, and exports to CSV, matching the SAS logic.
  - The use of macro variables (e.g., %let outpath) in SAS is replaced by a Python variable (outpath).
  - No SAS-specific constructs such as RETAIN, LAG, FIRST., LAST., or dynamic macro execution (CALL EXECUTE, SYMPUT) are present in the SAS code, so none are missing in Python.
  - Recommendation: No macro conversion issues found, as there are no macros in the SAS code. All procedural logic appears to be fully implemented in Python.
