Macro Name: (No explicit macro found; all logic is in open code and PROC steps)

- Missing/Unconverted in Python: No
- Remarks or Recommendations:
  - The SAS code does not define any %MACRO blocks; all logic is implemented as open PROC SQL, DATA, and PROC EXPORT steps.
  - All business logic (Teradata extraction, enrichment, eligibility flag, filtering, and CSV export) is present and mapped in the Python code as functions.
  - The Python code replicates:
    - The Teradata connection (via SQLAlchemy/teradatasql).
    - The SQL join and business rule logic (in extract_healthcare_data and enrich_data).
    - The eligibility filter (in filter_eligible_members).
    - The export to CSV (in export_to_csv).
  - There are no SAS-specific constructs (e.g., RETAIN, LAG, FIRST., LAST., macro variables, CALL EXECUTE, SYMPUT) in the SAS code, so nothing is missing in the Python translation.
  - No placeholder comments or stubbed-out logic are present in the Python code.

Summary: There are no %MACRO definitions in the SAS file. All business logic and data steps are fully reflected in the Python code. No unconverted or missing macro logic detected.
