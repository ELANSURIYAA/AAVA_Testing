Macro Name: (No explicit SAS macro definitions found; all logic is procedural)

- Missing/Unconverted in Python: Partial
- Remarks or Recommendations:
  - The SAS code does not use %MACRO definitions, but contains procedural steps (libname, PROC SQL, DATA step, PROC EXPORT) that must be mapped to Python functions.
  - SAS LIBNAME statement for Teradata connection is replaced by SQLAlchemy engine in Python, which is correctly implemented.
  - PROC SQL logic for joining, enriching, and eligibility calculation is fully converted in the Python extract_healthcare_data() function.
  - DATA step for filtering eligible members is converted in the Python filter_eligible_members() function.
  - PROC EXPORT for CSV output is converted in the Python export_to_csv() function.
  - SAS macro variable &outpath is replaced by a hardcoded string in Python; consider parameterizing this in Python for flexibility.
  - No SAS-specific constructs (BY, FIRST., LAST., RETAIN, LAG, CALL EXECUTE, SYMPUT, INFILE/INPUT/PUT) are present in the SAS code, so no conversion is required for these.
  - No placeholder comments or stubbed logic found in the Python code.
  - All business rules and eligibility logic are carried over.
  - Recommendation: If future SAS macros are added, ensure dynamic parameterization and macro variable handling are reflected in Python using function arguments or templating.
