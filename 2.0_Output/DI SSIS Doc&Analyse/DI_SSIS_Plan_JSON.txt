        "Approximate Data Volume Processed": {
          "Input Data": "50\u2013100 GB (based on main tables such as cc_Claim, cc_incident, cc_bodypart, and reference tables; only a subset of total EDW/ClaimCenter data processed per run)",

          "8 executors provide parallelism for 50\u2013100GB input and complex join chains.",
          "16GB memory per executor is required for large joins and caching reference data.",
          "Job duration reflects shuffle-heavy joins, derived columns, and output writes.",
