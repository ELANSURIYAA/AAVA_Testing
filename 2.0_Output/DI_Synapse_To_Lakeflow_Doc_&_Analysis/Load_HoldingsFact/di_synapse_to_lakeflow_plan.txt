==============================================================================

1. Lakeflow Cost Estimation
1.1 Pipeline/Compute Cost Breakdown

Data Volume Processed per Run: 650 GB

Execution Frequency: 1 run/day

Monthly Volume Processed: 19,500 GB

Lakeflow Pricing Used: $0.50 per compute unit (Standard Tier)

Estimated Monthly Cost (USD): $9,750

Cost Formula Used:
Monthly Cost = (Estimated Compute Units × $0.50)
Assuming 1 compute unit per GB processed:
Monthly Cost = 19,500 × $0.50 = $9,750
(Storage & orchestration cost not included as no explicit storage cost provided.)

2. Manual Flow Adjustment and Data Reconciliation Effort

Flow Logic Adjustments (e.g., transformation steps, task dependencies): 6 hrs

Schema/Data Type Alignment (e.g., dataset structure, catalog mapping): 4 hrs

Error/Exception Handling Logic: 3 hrs

Output Validation & Data Reconciliation Testing: 4 hrs

Total Estimated Effort: 17 hrs

2.2 Developer Cost

Developer Hourly Rate: $50/hr

Total Developer Cost: $850 USD

3. API Processing Cost
