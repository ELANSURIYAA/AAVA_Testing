Description:   Analysis of Databricks DBU pricing and data volume context for Synapse SQL-to-Lakeflow migration.
=============================================

## 1. Pipeline Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of Databricks DBU pricing and indicative data volumes for key tables relevant to Synapse SQL pipeline migration. The information supports cost modeling, capacity planning, and migration strategy for transitioning from Synapse SQL to Lakeflow (Databricks). The context is focused on enterprise-scale data warehousing, with processed volumes and target tables mapped for migration.

## 2. Complexity Metrics

| Category                  | Measurement                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of Activities      | 0 (No explicit pipeline activities defined in file)                          |
| Source/Target Systems     | Source: Synapse SQL, Target: Databricks Lakeflow                             |
| Transformation Logic      | None specified                                                               |
| Parameters Used           | None specified                                                               |
| Reusable Components       | None specified                                                               |
| Control Logic             | None specified                                                               |
| External Dependencies     | None specified                                                               |
| Performance Considerations| Data volume context provided (~650 GB processed)                             |
| Volume Handling           | Indicative volumes for tables (see below)                                    |
| Error Handling            | None specified                                                               |
| Overall Complexity Score  | 5 (Low complexity; pricing and volume context only)                          |
| Conversion complexity rating | Low (Score: 5/100) - Only pricing and volume context, no pipeline logic   |

**Justification:**  
The file contains only pricing and data volume context, with no pipeline activities, transformation logic, or control flow. Migration complexity is low, as only metadata and cost information are present.

## 3. Syntax Differences

- **Synapse SQL Context:**  
  The file provides metadata (DBU pricing, table volumes) but does not include SQL constructs, stored procedures, or pipeline activities.

- **Lakeflow Mapping:**  
  - Pricing information is used for Lakeflow cost modeling.
  - Data volume metrics inform Lakeflow cluster sizing and resource allocation.
  - No direct mapping of SQL syntax or pipeline logic is required.

**Example:**  
- Synapse SQL: Pricing and volume context typically handled outside pipeline logic.
- Lakeflow: Use pricing and volume metrics for cluster configuration and operational planning.

---

## 4. Manual Adjustments

- **Required Interventions:**  
  - None required for migration, as the file contains only metadata.
  - Ensure DBU pricing and volume metrics are referenced in Lakeflow cost modeling documentation.

---

## 5. Optimization Techniques

- **Lakeflow Recommendations:**  
  - Use provided data volume metrics to size Lakeflow clusters appropriately.
  - Reference DBU pricing for cost optimization and budget planning.
  - No refactoring or rebuilding required, as no pipeline logic is present.
