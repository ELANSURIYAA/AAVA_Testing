Description:   Analysis of Databricks Pricing (DBU) and indicative data volumes for migration assessment.
=============================================

## 1. Pipeline Overview

This document provides a summary of Databricks DBU (Databricks Unit) pricing and indicative data volumes for several tables relevant to migration planning. No explicit pipeline or SQL transformation logic is present in the file. The content is limited to cost ranges and estimated table sizes, which can inform Lakeflow migration sizing and cost estimation.

## 2. Complexity Metrics

| Category                  | Measurement                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of Activities      | Not specified                                                               |
| Source/Target Systems     | Table names listed; no explicit source/target system mapping                |
| Transformation Logic      | Not specified                                                               |
| Parameters Used           | Not specified                                                               |
| Reusable Components       | Not specified                                                               |
| Control Logic             | Not specified                                                               |
| External Dependencies     | Not specified                                                               |
| Performance Considerations| Data volume estimates provided                                              |
| Volume Handling           | Indicative volumes for tables (see below)                                   |
| Error Handling            | Not specified                                                               |
| Overall Complexity Score  | 0                                                                           |
| Conversion complexity rating | Low (No pipeline or SQL logic to convert; only metadata present)          |

**Justification:**  
The file contains only pricing and volume metadata, with no pipeline, SQL, or transformation logic. Therefore, the conversion complexity is minimal (Low), as there is nothing to convert except for referencing table sizes in migration planning.

## 3. Syntax Differences

No SQL constructs, stored procedures, activities, or data flows are present in the file. Therefore, there are no syntax differences to map between Synapse SQL and Lakeflow SQL for this file.

## 4. Manual Adjustments

No manual interventions are required, as there are no pipeline features, parameterization, or dependency chains present in the file.

## 5. Optimization Techniques

No pipeline or transformation logic is present. No refactoring or rebuilding is required. For migration planning, use the provided table sizes to estimate Lakeflow storage and compute requirements.
