# OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 Python Runtime Cost 
      - provide the calculation breakup of the cost and the reasons

Based on the data volumes and processing requirements, the Python runtime cost can be estimated as follows:

**Resource Requirements:**
- CPU: 32 cores
- Memory: 256 GB RAM
- Storage: 5 TB SSD storage

**Cloud Computing Costs:**
- Using a cloud instance similar to AWS r5.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 256 GB RAM): $2.00 per hour
- Storage costs for 5 TB SSD: $0.10 per GB per month = $500 per month
- Data processing (30% of total data daily): 
  * EMPLOYEES: 300 GB
  * DEPARTMENTS: 60 GB
  * LOCATIONS: 60 GB
  * Output Tables: 720 GB
  * Total: 1,140 GB processed daily

**Daily Runtime Cost:**
- Compute cost: $2.00/hour × 2 hours = $4.00
- Daily storage cost: $500/30 = $16.67
- Total daily cost: $20.67

**Monthly Runtime Cost:**
- Compute cost: $4.00 × 30 days = $120.00
- Storage cost: $500.00
- Total monthly cost: $620.00

**Reasons for Cost Calculation:**
- The compute instance needs to be powerful enough to handle the large data volumes and complex transformations
- The 2-hour runtime is based on the current SSIS execution time
- Storage costs are calculated based on the total data volume that needs to be stored
- The cost is higher than the SSIS runtime ($0.84/hour) due to the need for more powerful computing resources to handle the data processing efficiently in Python

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 Python identified manual component conversion and unit testing effort in hours covering the various transformations, control flows, and data pipelines

**Manual Component Conversion and Unit Testing:**
- Source Component Testing: 4 hours
  * Verify filtering logic for employee records
  * Test data extraction and transformation

- Lookup Components Testing: 6 hours
  * Validate lookup operations for DEPARTMENTS table
  * Validate lookup operations for LOCATIONS table
  * Test join operations and data matching

- Destination Components Testing: 6 hours
  * Test data loading to EMPLOYEES_DW table
  * Test data loading to HIGHSALARY_SUMMARY table
  * Test data loading to LOWSALARY_SUMMARY table

- Logging Table Testing: 2 hours
  * Verify error logging functionality
  * Test log entry creation and storage

- Control Flow and Event Handler Testing: 4 hours
  * Test execution flow and task sequencing
  * Validate error handling mechanisms

- Expression Testing: 2 hours
  * Test dynamic expressions and their Python equivalents

- Variable/Parameter Testing: 2 hours
  * Validate configuration parameters
  * Test variable usage and scope

- Connection Manager Testing: 2 hours
  * Test database connections
  * Validate file system operations

**Subtotal: 28 hours**

   2.2 Effort in hours to validate the result from the Python program output that compares the output from SSIS package and Python script

**Data Validation Testing:**
- Output Data Comparison: 6 hours
  * Compare EMPLOYEES_DW table data between SSIS and Python outputs
  * Compare HIGHSALARY_SUMMARY table data
  * Compare LOWSALARY_SUMMARY table data

- Performance Comparison: 4 hours
  * Compare execution times
  * Analyze resource utilization

- Error Handling Validation: 2 hours
  * Compare error logs
  * Validate exception handling

**Subtotal: 12 hours**

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours
      - provide the reason for the total effort hours and how it was arrived

**Total Estimated Effort: 40 hours**

**Reasoning for Total Effort:**
- Manual component conversion and unit testing: 28 hours
- Data validation testing: 12 hours
- The total effort of 40 hours (approximately 1 week for one engineer) accounts for the complexity of the SSIS package (rated 40/100)
- High-complexity areas like Lookups and dynamic expressions require more testing time
- The large data volumes necessitate thorough validation to ensure data integrity
- The effort estimate assumes that the Python code has already been converted and only requires testing and fixing

The total effort represents a reasonable timeline for a skilled data engineer to thoroughly test and validate the Python implementation against the original SSIS package, ensuring that all functionality is correctly replicated and that the data processing results are consistent between the two implementations.
