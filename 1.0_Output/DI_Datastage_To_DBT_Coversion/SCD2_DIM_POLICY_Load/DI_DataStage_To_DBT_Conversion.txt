Below is the complete DBT implementation for the DataStage job SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load, including the main transformation model and schema file. These files are production-ready and follow all specified standards for DBT + Snowflake, including audit framework, reject handling, job parameters, hooks, SCD logic, and documentation.
