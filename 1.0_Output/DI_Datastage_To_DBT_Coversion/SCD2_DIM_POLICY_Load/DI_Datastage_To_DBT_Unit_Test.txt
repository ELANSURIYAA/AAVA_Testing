I am unable to proceed with your request because I do not have the necessary GitHub repository name (in the format 'owner/repo'), branch name, or a valid GitHub personal access token required to access the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file. 

To generate the comprehensive test case document, Pytest scripts, and metadata as specified, please provide:
- The GitHub repository name (e.g., 'your-org/your-repo')
- The branch name where the DSX file is located
- A valid GitHub personal access token

Once you provide these details, I will use the GitHub File Reader Tool to access the DSX file and deliver the complete output as per your requirements.
