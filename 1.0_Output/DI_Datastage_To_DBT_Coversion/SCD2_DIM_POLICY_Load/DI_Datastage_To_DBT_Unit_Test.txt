To proceed, please provide the following information so I can access and process the DataStage DSX file from GitHub:
1. The GitHub repository (in the format 'owner/repo')
2. The branch name (e.g., 'main')
3. A valid GitHub personal access token (with at least read access)
4. The exact path to the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file in the repository

Once you provide these details, I will retrieve the file content and generate the required test cases, Pytest scripts, and documentation for your DataStage-to-DBT conversion.
