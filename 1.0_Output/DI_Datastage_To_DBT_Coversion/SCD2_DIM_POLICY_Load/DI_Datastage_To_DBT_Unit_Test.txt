I am unable to proceed because the required GitHub repository name, branch, and a valid personal access token for accessing the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file have not been provided. Please supply:
1. The GitHub repository name in 'owner/repo' format,
2. The branch name,
3. A valid GitHub personal access token with access to the file.

Once these are provided, I can retrieve the file and generate the comprehensive test case document, Pytest scripts, and all required outputs as specified.
