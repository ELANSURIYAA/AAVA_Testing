Description:   ETL Conversion Review Output – DataStage to DBT Model Comparison and Assessment
=============================================

1. Summary
I am unable to proceed with your request because I do not have the necessary GitHub repository name (in the format 'owner/repo'), branch name, or a valid GitHub personal access token required to access the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file and the converted DBT project files. To perform a comprehensive ETL conversion review, I must access both the DataStage DSX file and the converted DBT model file using the GitHub File Reader Tool. Please provide the following:
- The GitHub repository name (e.g., 'your-org/your-repo')
- The branch name where the DSX and DBT files are located
- A valid GitHub personal access token

2. Conversion Accuracy

4. Optimization Suggestions

6. Recommendations
Please supply the repository name, branch, and token so I can access and review the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx and the converted DBT model file as requested.

7. API Cost Consumed

Once the required GitHub details are provided, I will use the GitHub File Reader Tool to access the files and deliver the complete output as per your requirements.
