I am unable to proceed with your request because I do not have the necessary GitHub repository name (in the format 'owner/repo'), branch name, or a valid GitHub personal access token required to access the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file and the converted DBT project files.

To generate the comprehensive Python-based reconciliation script with the required metadata and validation logic, please provide:
- The GitHub repository name (e.g., 'your-org/your-repo')
- The branch name where the DSX and DBT files are located
- A valid GitHub personal access token

Once you provide these details, I will use the GitHub File Reader Tool to access the files and deliver the complete output as per your requirements.
