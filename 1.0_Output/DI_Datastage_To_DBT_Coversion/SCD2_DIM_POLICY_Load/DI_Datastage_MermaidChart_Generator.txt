I am unable to access the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file from GitHub due to missing or invalid credentials. Please provide the correct GitHub repository name (in 'owner/repo' format), the branch name, and a valid GitHub personal access token with access to the file. Once I have these, I can proceed to read the DSX file and generate the complete Mermaid flowchart as specified.
