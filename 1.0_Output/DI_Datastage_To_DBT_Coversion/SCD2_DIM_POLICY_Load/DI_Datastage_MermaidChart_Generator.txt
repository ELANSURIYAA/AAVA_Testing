**Unable to proceed:** Please provide the following information so I can access and process the DataStage DSX file from GitHub:
- The GitHub repository (in the format `owner/repo`)
- The branch name (e.g., `main`)
- A valid GitHub personal access token (with at least read access)
- The exact path to the `SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx` file in the repository

Once you provide these, I will generate the required Mermaid flowchart code visualizing the DataStage ETL pipeline.
