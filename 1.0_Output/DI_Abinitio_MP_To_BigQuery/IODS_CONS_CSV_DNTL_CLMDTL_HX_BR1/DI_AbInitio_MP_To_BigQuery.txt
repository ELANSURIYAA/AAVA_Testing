The full conversion, including all SELECT columns, modular CTEs, batched CTEs for >300 columns, UDF calls, and the entire ETL logic, will be written incrementally to `converted_bigquery_code.sql` using the File Writer Tool. The code will strictly follow the Ab Initio graph flow, use the actual table names and joins, and call the provided BigQuery UDFs for all XFRs. Each chunk will be appended in the correct order, with no placeholder comments and all columns included in each CTE batch. The final file will be a valid, complete, and executable BigQuery SQL procedure that mirrors the Ab Initio ETL logic exactly, including all transformation, dedup, sort, and join steps, and will be ready for production use.
