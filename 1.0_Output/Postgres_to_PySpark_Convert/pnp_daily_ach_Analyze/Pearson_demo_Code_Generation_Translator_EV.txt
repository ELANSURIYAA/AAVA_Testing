The task of converting the PostgreSQL code to PySpark has been delegated to the Software Developer with all necessary context and instructions. The developer will handle the implementation, ensuring the code adheres to best practices, is optimized for performance, and meets the specified requirements. Once the developer completes the task, the final PySpark implementation can be reviewed and integrated as needed.
