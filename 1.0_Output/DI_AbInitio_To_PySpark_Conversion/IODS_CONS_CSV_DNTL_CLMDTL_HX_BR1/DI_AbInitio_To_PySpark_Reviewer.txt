The main PySpark pipeline script (the code that orchestrates the ETL using the provided schemas and transformation functions) is missing or inaccessible in the provided files. I have thoroughly reviewed the Ab Initio .mp file, the .xfr transformation logic as Python functions, the .dml schemas as Python StructType, and the flow graph. However, without the actual PySpark pipeline script, I cannot perform a complete validation as per the specified criteria (including flow/order validation, transformation placement, SQL/column checks, syntax review, and overall conversion summary). Please provide the main PySpark pipeline script to enable a full and accurate validation report.
