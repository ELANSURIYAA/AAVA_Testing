Thought: The second file contains only a pipeline analysis and metrics report, not the actual Databricks Lakeflow notebook code. The original user context, however, provided the full converted Lakeflow pipeline code (SQL, PySpark, and driver notebooks) in the prompt. I can use that detailed pipeline code to design the required test cases and Pytest scripts, as it contains all the necessary logic and business rules. I will proceed to synthesize the test case list and Pytest scripts based on the provided pipeline code.
