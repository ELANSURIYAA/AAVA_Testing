Description: DataStage job analysis and metrics report for SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx migration to dbt (Snowflake).

# 1. Job Overview

Unable to proceed: The required DataStage job file (SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx) could not be accessed from GitHub due to missing repository name and/or access credentials. All analysis and metrics must be derived directly from the input file, but the file could not be retrieved.

# 2. Complexity Metrics

| Category                | Measurement |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Number of Stages        | N/A        |
| Source/Target Systems   | N/A        |
| Transformation Stages   | N/A        |
| Parameters Used         | N/A        |
| Reusable Components     | N/A        |
| Control Logic           | N/A        |
| External Dependencies   | N/A        |
| Performance Considerations | N/A     |
| Volume Handling         | N/A        |
| Error Handling          | N/A        |
| Overall Complexity Score| N/A        |
| Conversion complexity rating | N/A   |

*Justification: No file content available for analysis.*

# 3. Syntax Differences

No DataStage constructs could be mapped to dbt/Snowflake SQL syntax due to missing input file.

# 4. Manual Adjustments

No manual interventions identified; input file required for extraction.

# 5. Optimization Techniques

No job-specific optimization recommendations possible without the actual DataStage job file.

# 6. API Cost

apiCost: 0.0000 USD

**Note:** Please provide the correct GitHub repository name and a valid personal access token to enable retrieval and analysis of the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file. All sections above must be populated directly from the actual job file for compliance with migration documentation standards.
