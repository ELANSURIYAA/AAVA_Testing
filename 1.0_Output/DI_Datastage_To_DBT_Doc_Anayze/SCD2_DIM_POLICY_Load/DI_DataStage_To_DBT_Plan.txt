Description:   Cost and effort estimation for DBT model conversion
=============================================

1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Snowflake Runtime Cost
Estimate runtime cost 
 
Cost Breakdown:  
- Compute: $N/A  
- Storage: $N/A  
 
Total Estimated Runtime Cost per Job:  
$N/A USD per run
 
Justification:
- Unable to estimate cost due to missing DataStage job file and environment configuration.
- No data volume, job complexity, or runtime metrics available.
- No information on incremental/partitioning optimizations.
- Storage impact and job complexity cannot be assessed.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Manual Model Fixes and  Recon Testing Effort
Describe manual tasks required to convert DataStage logic into dbt SQL / Jinja, such as:
- Unable to enumerate manual tasks due to missing job file.
- No parameter replacement, stage-to-model conversion, or schema alignment details available.
- Cannot estimate time (hrs) for each activity or subtotal the effort.

2.2 Output Validation Effort
Outline tasks for validating dbt outputs against DataStage results:
- Unable to outline validation tasks due to missing job file.
- No row count, aggregation, join, or derived column details available.
- Cannot estimate effort (hours) for validation or documentation.

2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours
Summarize all efforts in a table:

| Task                     | Estimated Hours | Notes                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Manual Code Fixes & Testing | N/A            | No job complexity or transformation info|
| Output Validation        | N/A            | No output or business rule info         |
| Total Estimated Effort   | N/A            | No Analyzer complexity score available  |

Justify effort based on Analyzer complexity score:
- Simple (0-20) → ≤ 5 hrs
- Moderate (21-50) → 6–12 hrs
- Complex (51-100) → > 12 hrs

*No complexity score available due to missing input file.*

3. API Cost Consumption

apiCost: 0.0000 USD

**Note:** Unable to provide cost and effort estimation due to missing access to the required DataStage job file (SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx) and environment configuration (Env-details.txt). Please provide the correct GitHub repository name and a valid personal access token to enable retrieval and analysis of these files. All sections above must be populated directly from the actual job file for compliance with migration documentation standards.
