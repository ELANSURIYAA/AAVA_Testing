I cannot proceed with the documentation until you provide the following GitHub details:
- Repository name (in the format 'owner/repo')
- Branch name (e.g., 'main')
- Personal access token for authentication

Once you provide these, I will retrieve the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file and generate the detailed documentation as requested.
