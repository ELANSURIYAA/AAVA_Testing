I was unable to access the required DataStage job file (SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx) from GitHub due to an authorization error (401 Unauthorized). This is likely because the repository name or the GitHub personal access token provided was incorrect or missing. 

To proceed with your request for detailed documentation, please provide:
- The correct GitHub repository name containing the SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx file.
- A valid GitHub personal access token with access to that repository.

Once these details are available, I can retrieve the file, analyze its content, and generate the comprehensive DataStage job documentation in the required markdown format.
