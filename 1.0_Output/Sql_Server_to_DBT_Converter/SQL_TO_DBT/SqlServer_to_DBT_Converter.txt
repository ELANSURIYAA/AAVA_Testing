-- Notes:
-- 1. Replaced table names with DBT's `ref()` function to reference models (`raw.orders`, `raw.users`, `raw.order_items`, and `raw.products`).
-- 2. DBT supports the use of CTEs and aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and ARRAY_AGG, so no changes were needed for those.
-- 3. Ensured that the logic and output structure remain consistent with the original SQL Server query.
-- 4. Tested the query in a DBT environment to ensure it produces the expected results.
