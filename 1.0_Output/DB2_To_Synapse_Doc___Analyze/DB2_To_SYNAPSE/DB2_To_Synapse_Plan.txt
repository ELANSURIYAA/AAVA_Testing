Both files have been successfully read. The first file contains the DB2 script, and the second file provides Synapse environment details, including pricing and cluster configuration. I now have the necessary information to calculate the estimated cost and effort.

Thought: I will calculate the Synapse SQL runtime cost and testing effort based on the provided data and context.
