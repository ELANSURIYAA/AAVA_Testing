Cost Estimation
1.1 Synapse SQL Runtime Cost
- The DB2 script and its converted Synapse SQL code are relatively simple, involving two tables (EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS), basic DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), a join, and a single stored procedure with basic logic.
- The Synapse analyzer output shows the main complexity is procedural logic (cursor, error handling) and not data volume or advanced SQL features.
- For a script of this size (less than 50 lines, no temporary tables, only a few DML statements), running cost in Synapse is minimal. Assuming a small dedicated SQL pool (DW100c) or serverless SQL pool:
  - Serverless SQL pool: $5 per TB processed (minimum charge is per query, but for small data, cost is negligible).
  - Data processed: Only a few rows (sample data), so cost is well below $0.01.
  - Estimated cost for running the converted Synapse SQL code: **$0.01 USD** (rounded up for minimum charge).
- The analyzer output confirms apiCost: 0.004 USD.

Calculation breakup:
- Synapse SQL runtime (serverless): $5/TB, but for a few KB of data, cost is negligible.
- No external data movement, no large data scans.
- Main cost is developer/test time, not compute.

Reasons:
- Small data volume, simple queries, no complex analytics or large scans.
- No temporary tables, no advanced features that would increase cost.

Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Synapse SQL manual code fixes and unit testing effort (temp tables, calculations):
- 8 syntax differences identified (cursor handling, error handling, parameter/variable declarations, loop/conditional logic, etc.).
- Manual effort required to:
  - Convert cursor logic and error handling to T-SQL.
  - Adjust parameter and variable declarations.
  - Refactor procedural logic (WHILE, IF, SET, etc.).
- No temporary tables or advanced calculations.
- Estimated manual code fixing effort: **3 hours**
  - 2 hours for code conversion (procedural to T-SQL, syntax fixes).
  - 1 hour for unit testing (run converted code, check for errors, basic validation).

2.2 Output validation effort (DB2 vs Synapse SQL script):
- Compare outputs of the original DB2 script and the converted Synapse SQL script for correctness.
- Includes:
  - Setting up test data in Synapse.
  - Running both scripts and comparing results for all DML and SELECT statements.
  - Verifying stored procedure output.
- Estimated output validation effort: **2 hours**

2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours
- Manual code fixing and unit testing: 3 hours
- Output validation: 2 hours
- **Total Estimated Effort: 5 hours**

Reason for total effort:
- The script is straightforward, with no advanced features or large data volumes.
- Main effort is in procedural logic conversion and validation, not in handling complex SQL or data migration.
- No need for extensive performance tuning or advanced troubleshooting.

API Cost
- apiCost: 0.004 USD

**Summary Table**

| Item                                   | Estimate          |
|---------------------------------------- |------------------|
| Synapse SQL Runtime Cost                | $0.01 USD        |
| Manual Code Fixing & Unit Testing       | 3 hours          |
| Output Validation Effort                | 2 hours          |
| **Total Estimated Effort**              | **5 hours**      |
| API Cost (for this call)                | 0.004 USD        |

**Reasons:**
- Minimal runtime cost due to small data and simple queries.
- Main effort is in procedural code conversion and validation.
- No incompatible data types or structural changes.
- No temp tables or advanced analytics.
- API cost as reported by analyzer.

**Complete Content Used:**
- DB2 script (EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, stored procedure, DML, transaction block).
- Synapse analyzer output (complexity, syntax differences, manual adjustment list, cost, and effort drivers).
