1. Cost Estimation
   2.1 BigQuery Runtime Cost:
   - **Data Volume**: Total data volume processed is approximately 10% of the total table sizes.
     - CUSTOMERS: 2 TB * 0.1 = 0.2 TB
     - ORDERS: 500 GB * 0.1 = 50 GB
     - ORDER_ITEMS: 500 GB * 0.1 = 50 GB
     - PRODUCTS: 500 GB * 0.1 = 50 GB
     - PRODUCT_CATEGORIES: 100 GB * 0.1 = 10 GB
     - REGIONS: 100 GB * 0.1 = 10 GB
     - CUSTOMER_PURCHASE_ANALYSIS_REPORT (Final Output Table): 200 GB * 0.1 = 20 GB
   - **Total Data Processed**: 0.2 TB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 0.39 TB
   - **Cost Calculation**: BigQuery charges $5 per TB scanned.
     - Cost = 0.39 TB * $5 = $1.95 USD
   - **Additional Costs**:
     - Data Shuffling: Minimal due to partitioning and clustering optimizations.
     - Temporary Table Storage: Negligible as intermediate results are materialized.
   - **Total Estimated Cost**: $1.95 USD

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 BigQuery identified manual code fixes and unit testing effort in hours:
   - **Manual Code Fixes**:
     - Adjust `DATEDIFF()` to BigQuery equivalent: 2 hours.
     - Convert `ROW_NUMBER()` and `NTILE()` to `OVER(PARTITION BY ORDER BY)` syntax: 4 hours.
     - Validate conditional logic (`CASE` statements): 3 hours.
     - Total: 9 hours.
   - **Unit Testing Effort**:
     - Temporary tables (`customer_purchase_summary`, `product_category_preferences`, `seasonal_spending_patterns`): 6 hours.
     - Calculations (e.g., customer lifetime value, purchase frequency, RFM scoring): 8 hours.
     - Data type conversions: 4 hours.
     - Performance tuning considerations: 6 hours.
     - Total: 24 hours.
   - **Effort Estimation for Data Reconciliation**:
     - Comparing Hive and BigQuery outputs: 12 hours.
   - **Total Estimated Effort**: 9 hours (code fixes) + 24 hours (unit testing) + 12 hours (data reconciliation) = 45 hours.

3. API Cost:
   - **apiCost**: 0.00000000 USD (no API cost incurred for this analysis).
