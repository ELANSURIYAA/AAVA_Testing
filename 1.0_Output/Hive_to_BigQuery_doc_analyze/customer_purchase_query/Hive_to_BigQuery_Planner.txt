1. Cost Estimation
   2.1 BigQuery Runtime Cost:
         - Calculation Breakup:
           BigQuery charges $5 per TB scanned for on-demand analysis. The data volume processed by the queries is approximately 10% of the total table sizes.
           - CUSTOMERS: 2 TB * 10% = 0.2 TB
           - ORDERS: 500 GB * 10% = 50 GB
           - ORDER_ITEMS: 500 GB * 10% = 50 GB
           - PRODUCTS: 500 GB * 10% = 50 GB
           - PRODUCT_CATEGORIES: 100 GB * 10% = 10 GB
           - REGIONS: 100 GB * 10% = 10 GB
           Total Data Scanned: 0.2 TB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 10 GB = 0.37 TB
           Cost: 0.37 TB * $5 = $1.85 USD
           - Additional Storage Costs:
             Final Output Table (CUSTOMER_PURCHASE_ANALYSIS_REPORT): 200 GB * $0.02 per GB = $4 USD
           Total BigQuery Runtime Cost: $1.85 + $4 = $5.85 USD

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 BigQuery Identified Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
         - Manual Code Fixes:
           - Replace Hive-specific functions with BigQuery equivalents (e.g., DATEDIFF, QUARTER, DAYOFWEEK).
           - Adjust window function syntax (ROW_NUMBER, NTILE).
           - Modify CASE statements for compatibility.
           Estimated Effort: 10 hours
         - Unit Testing:
           - Validate temporary tables, calculations, and data type conversions.
           - Test performance tuning considerations (e.g., partitioning, clustering).
           Estimated Effort: 15 hours
   2.2 Effort Estimation for Data Reconciliation:
         - Compare Hive and BigQuery outputs for accuracy.
         - Validate data consistency, aggregation results, and derived metrics.
         Estimated Effort: 20 hours
   Total Testing Effort: 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 hours
