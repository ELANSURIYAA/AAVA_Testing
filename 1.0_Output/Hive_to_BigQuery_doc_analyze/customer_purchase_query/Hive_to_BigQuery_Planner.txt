1. Cost Estimation
   2.1 BigQuery Runtime Cost:
       - Calculation Breakup:
         * CUSTOMERS table (~2 TB): 10% processed = 200 GB
         * ORDERS table (~500 GB): 10% processed = 50 GB
         * ORDER_ITEMS table (~500 GB): 10% processed = 50 GB
         * PRODUCTS table (~500 GB): 10% processed = 50 GB
         * PRODUCT_CATEGORIES table (~100 GB): 10% processed = 10 GB
         * REGIONS table (~100 GB): 10% processed = 10 GB
         * Total data scanned = 370 GB
         * BigQuery cost per TB scanned = $5
         * Cost for 370 GB scanned = (370 / 1024) * $5 = $1.81 USD
         * Temporary table storage costs: Negligible for this query as intermediate results are not stored persistently.
         * Data shuffling costs: Minimal as the query uses JOINs and GROUP BYs efficiently.

       - Total BigQuery Runtime Cost: $1.81 USD

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 BigQuery identified manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Manual Code Fixes:
         * Conversion of Hive-specific functions like `DATEDIFF`, `DAYOFWEEK`, `QUARTER`, etc., to BigQuery equivalents.
         * Adjustments for BigQuery's handling of NULL values and division by zero.
         * Modifications for BigQuery's window functions and NTILE implementation.
         * Estimated effort: 8 hours

       - Unit Testing Effort:
         * Testing temporary tables and intermediate calculations.
         * Validating data type conversions and ensuring compatibility.
         * Performance tuning for JOINs and GROUP BYs.
         * Estimated effort: 12 hours

   2.2 Effort estimation for data reconciliation:
       - Comparing Hive output with BigQuery results for accuracy.
       - Validating data integrity and consistency.
       - Estimated effort: 10 hours

   - Total Testing Effort: 30 hours

3. API Cost:
