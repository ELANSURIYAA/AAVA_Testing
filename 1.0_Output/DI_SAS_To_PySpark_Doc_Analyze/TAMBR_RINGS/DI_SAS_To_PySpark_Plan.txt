Description:   Effort and cost estimation for PySpark migration and testing of TAMBR_RINGS SAS code (blocked due to missing analyzer and environment files)
=============================================

1.1 Cost Estimation
   1.1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost 
         - Unable to provide calculation breakup or cost estimation because the required PySpark environment details (PySpark_Env_Details_Azure_Databricks.txt) are missing.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 Unable to estimate manual code fixes and unit testing effort hours because the SAS CODE ANALYZER output for TAMBR_RINGS.txt is missing, which is required to identify manual intervention areas and testing scope.

Manual adjustments from the Analyzer output cannot be replicated as the analyzer output is not available.

apiCost: 0.0 USD

**Note:** Please ensure the SAS CODE ANALYZER output for TAMBR_RINGS.txt and the PySpark environment details file are available and accessible to proceed with the required estimation and documentation.
