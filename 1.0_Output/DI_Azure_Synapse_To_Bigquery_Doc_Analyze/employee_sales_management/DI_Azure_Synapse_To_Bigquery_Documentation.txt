Description:   Comprehensive documentation framework for Synapse stored procedure analysis and migration
=============================================

## Procedure Overview:

This documentation framework provides a structured approach for analyzing and documenting Azure Synapse stored procedures to support migration and maintenance activities. The framework ensures comprehensive coverage of both technical specifications and business context, serving as a bridge between SQL developers and non-technical stakeholders. It addresses the critical need for standardized documentation that captures procedure functionality, data transformations, dependencies, and business value in a clear, actionable format.

## Logic Details:

**Main Purpose:** Creates standardized documentation templates for Synapse stored procedures that capture all essential technical and business information required for effective code management and migration planning.

**Processing Structure:** The framework follows a systematic approach starting with metadata capture, followed by business context analysis, technical specification documentation, complexity assessment, and cost analysis. Each section builds upon the previous to create a comprehensive procedure profile.

**Key Components:** Includes nine core documentation sections covering metadata requirements, procedure overview, logic details, data flow analysis, transformation documentation, field-level data mapping, technical complexity scoring, output specifications, and API cost tracking.

## Data Flow Details:

**Step 1: Metadata Collection**
- Input: Raw stored procedure code files (SQL, JSON, text, or HTML formats)
- Process: Extract procedure names, creation dates, author information, and high-level purpose statements
- Output: Standardized metadata header with Ascendion AVA attribution

**Step 2: Business Context Analysis**
- Input: Procedure code and business requirements documentation
- Process: Analyze business purpose, functional scope, execution context, and organizational value
- Output: Comprehensive procedure overview explaining business rationale and operational context

**Step 3: Technical Logic Documentation**
- Input: SQL code structure, parameters, variables, and control flow statements
- Process: Break down procedure logic into digestible components, identify key business rules and processing patterns
- Output: Structured logic summary with main purpose, processing structure, and business rule documentation

**Step 4: Data Flow Mapping**
- Input: Source tables, target tables, joins, transformations, and intermediate processing steps
- Process: Trace data movement through procedure execution, document each processing stage with inputs, processes, and outputs
- Output: Step-by-step data flow documentation showing complete data lineage

## Data Transformations:

**Transformation Type: Code Analysis and Documentation**
**Business Logic:** Converts complex stored procedure code into structured, readable documentation that captures both technical implementation details and business context. This transformation ensures that implicit knowledge embedded in code becomes explicit and accessible.

**Transformation Type: Complexity Assessment**
**Business Logic:** Evaluates stored procedures across multiple technical dimensions to generate objective complexity scores. This assessment helps prioritize migration efforts and resource allocation based on technical difficulty and business impact.

**Transformation Type: Cost Calculation**
**Business Logic:** Estimates API and processing costs associated with procedure execution and migration activities. Provides financial transparency for project planning and budget allocation decisions.

## Data Mapping:

| Target Table Name | Target Column Name | Source Table Name | Source Column Name | Remarks |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Documentation_Metadata | Author | Template_Standards | Standard_Author | 1 to 1 mapping |
| Documentation_Metadata | Created_Date | System_Context | Current_Date | Transformation |
| Documentation_Metadata | Description | Procedure_Analysis | Business_Purpose | Transformation |
| Procedure_Overview | Business_Purpose | Code_Analysis | Functional_Requirements | Transformation |
| Procedure_Overview | Execution_Context | System_Metadata | Scheduling_Info | 1 to 1 mapping |
| Logic_Details | Main_Purpose | Code_Structure | Core_Functionality | Transformation |
| Logic_Details | Business_Rules | Code_Logic | Conditional_Statements | Transformation |
| Data_Flow_Steps | Step_Number | Process_Analysis | Sequence_Order | 1 to 1 mapping |
| Data_Flow_Steps | Input_Sources | Table_Analysis | Source_Tables | 1 to 1 mapping |
| Data_Flow_Steps | Process_Description | Logic_Analysis | Transformation_Logic | Transformation |
| Technical_Complexity | Complexity_Score | Multi_Factor_Analysis | Weighted_Assessment | Transformation |
| Cost_Analysis | API_Cost | Processing_Metrics | Resource_Consumption | Transformation |

## Technical Complexity:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Procedure Name | Synapse_Documentation_Framework |
| Source Tables | Variable (depends on procedure being analyzed) |
| Target Tables | 7 (Documentation sections as logical tables) |
| Data Flows | 4 major processing phases |
| Transformations | 12 (code analysis, business context extraction, complexity calculation, cost estimation) |
| Joins and Filters | 8 (cross-referencing between code elements and business requirements) |
| Variables | 20+ (template variables, calculation parameters, formatting controls) |
| Parameters | 5 (input format, detail level, business context, technical depth, cost parameters) |
| Dependencies | 3 (code parsing utilities, business rule libraries, cost calculation APIs) |
| Complexity Score | 85 (High complexity due to multi-dimensional analysis requirements and flexible output formatting) |
