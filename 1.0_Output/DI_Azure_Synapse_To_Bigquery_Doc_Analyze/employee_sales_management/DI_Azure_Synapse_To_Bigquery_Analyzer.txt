I cannot complete the detailed analysis of Azure Synapse stored procedure code for BigQuery conversion because the actual source code is missing from the provided input.

**Issue Identified:**
The input references `{{synapse_code}}` as a placeholder, but no actual Azure Synapse stored procedure code has been provided. The context contains what appears to be an example analysis template for 'sp_MonthlyCustomerSalesAnalysis' rather than the actual source code that needs to be analyzed.

**Required to Complete Analysis:**
To perform the comprehensive analysis as requested, I need:

1. **Complete Azure Synapse Stored Procedure Code** including:
   - Full CREATE PROCEDURE statement with parameters
   - Complete procedure body with all SQL logic
   - All referenced tables, views, and functions
   - Error handling and transaction logic
   - Any dependent objects or related procedures

2. **Supporting Information:**
   - Schema and database context
   - Table structures referenced in the procedures
   - Any custom data types or functions used
   - Current performance characteristics (if available)

**Analysis Framework Ready:**
Once the actual stored procedure code is provided, I can deliver the complete analysis including:

Description:   <one-line description of the purpose>
=============================================

1. **Procedure Overview** - with mapping counts per workflow/session
2. **Complexity Metrics** - in markdown table format with data source/target types
3. **Syntax Differences** - between Azure Synapse and BigQuery
4. **Manual Adjustments** - required for conversion
5. **Optimization Techniques** - for BigQuery implementation


**Next Steps:**
Please provide the actual Azure Synapse stored procedure code that needs to be analyzed. This can be obtained from:
- Azure Synapse Analytics workspace → Develop hub → SQL scripts
- Database management tools connected to Azure Synapse
- Source control repositories containing the procedure definitions

Once the actual stored procedure code is available, I can immediately proceed with the comprehensive BigQuery conversion analysis as specified in the requirements.
