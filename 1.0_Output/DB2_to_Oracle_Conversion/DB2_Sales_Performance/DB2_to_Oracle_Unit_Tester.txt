1. Test Case List:
   - Test Case ID: TC001
     - Test Case Description: Validate the correct segmentation of customers based on age groups.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are categorized into the correct age groups ('18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', '55+') based on their age.
   - Test Case ID: TC002
     - Test Case Description: Verify the calculation of total orders, total revenue, and average order value in the sales_analysis table.
     - Expected Outcome: The total orders, revenue, and average order value are calculated correctly for each customer.
   - Test Case ID: TC003
     - Test Case Description: Test the handling of NULL values in the sales_transactions table.
     - Expected Outcome: NULL values in fields like total_sale_amount or quantity_sold do not cause errors and are handled gracefully.
   - Test Case ID: TC004
     - Test Case Description: Validate the ranking logic for customers based on comprehensive performance score.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are ranked correctly within their segments, and the top 100 customers per segment are selected.
   - Test Case ID: TC005
     - Test Case Description: Verify the calculation of customer lifetime value and segmentation.
     - Expected Outcome: Customers are assigned the correct segment ('Premium', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze') based on their total revenue.
   - Test Case ID: TC006
     - Test Case Description: Test the performance of the query with a large dataset.
     - Expected Outcome: The query executes within an acceptable time frame without errors.
   - Test Case ID: TC007
     - Test Case Description: Validate the calculation of months_since_last_purchase.
     - Expected Outcome: The months_since_last_purchase is calculated correctly based on the last_purchase_date.
