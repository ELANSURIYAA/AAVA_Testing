1. Test Case Document:
   - Test Case ID: TC001
     - Description: Validate the correct segmentation of customers based on age groups.
     - Preconditions: The `customer_dimension` table is populated with customer data.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for customer segmentation.
       2. Verify the age groups are correctly categorized.
     - Expected Result: Customers are categorized into the correct age groups ('18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', '55+') based on their age.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC002
     - Description: Verify the calculation of total orders, total revenue, and average order value in the `sales_analysis` table.
     - Preconditions: The `sales_transactions` table is populated with sales data.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for sales analysis.
       2. Verify the calculations for total orders, revenue, and average order value.
     - Expected Result: The total orders, revenue, and average order value are calculated correctly for each customer.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC003
     - Description: Test the handling of NULL values in the `sales_transactions` table.
     - Preconditions: The `sales_transactions` table contains NULL values in some fields.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query to count NULL values.
       2. Verify that NULL values do not cause errors.
     - Expected Result: NULL values in fields like `total_sale_amount` or `quantity_sold` are handled gracefully.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC004
     - Description: Validate the ranking logic for customers based on comprehensive performance score.
     - Preconditions: The `ranked_customers` table is populated with customer data.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for customer ranking.
       2. Verify the ranking logic and top 100 customers per segment.
     - Expected Result: Customers are ranked correctly within their segments, and the top 100 customers per segment are selected.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC005
     - Description: Verify the calculation of customer lifetime value and segmentation.
     - Preconditions: The `customer_lifetime_value` table is populated with customer data.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for customer lifetime value.
       2. Verify the segmentation logic.
     - Expected Result: Customers are assigned the correct segment ('Premium', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze') based on their total revenue.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC006
     - Description: Test the performance of the query with a large dataset.
     - Preconditions: The database contains a large dataset.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for performance testing.
       2. Measure the execution time.
     - Expected Result: The query executes within an acceptable time frame without errors.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

   - Test Case ID: TC007
     - Description: Validate the calculation of `months_since_last_purchase`.
     - Preconditions: The `customer_segmentation` table is populated with customer data.
     - Test Steps:
       1. Execute the SQL query for `months_since_last_purchase`.
       2. Verify the calculation logic.
     - Expected Result: The `months_since_last_purchase` is calculated correctly based on the `last_purchase_date`.
     - Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
     - Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]
