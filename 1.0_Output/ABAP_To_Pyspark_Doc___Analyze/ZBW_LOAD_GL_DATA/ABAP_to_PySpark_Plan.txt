1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost
       - Data Volume:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Total Data Processed: (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB) * 10% = ~380 GB
       - Estimated Runtime: Assuming 1 hour of processing for 380 GB of data.
       - Cost Calculation: 
         - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
         - Average Cost: ($0.15 + $0.75) / 2 = $0.45 per hour.
         - Total Cost: $0.45 * 1 hour = $0.45 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark Code Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
       - Syntax Differences Identified: 6 (e.g., `OPEN DATASET` → `spark.read.csv`, `SPLIT` → `split`, etc.).
       - Temporary Tables: 2.
       - Estimated Effort: 2 hours per syntax difference + 1 hour per temporary table = (6 * 2) + (2 * 1) = 14 hours.
   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
       - Comparing ABAP and PySpark outputs for accuracy.
       - Estimated Effort: 4 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours:
       - Total Effort: 14 hours (code fixes and unit testing) + 4 hours (output validation) = 18 hours.
       - Reason: The effort is based on the complexity of syntax differences, the number of temporary tables, and the validation process.

3. API Cost
   - apiCost: 0.003 USD.

Summary:
- PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.45 USD.
- Total Effort: 18 hours.
- API Cost: 0.003 USD.
