### 1. Cost Estimation:
#### 1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
- **Data Volumes**:
  - Input Tables:
    - `FINANCE_DATA_RAW`: ~2 TB
    - `FINANCE_AGGREGATE`: ~500 GB
    - `COST_CENTER_LOOKUP`: ~500 GB
    - `GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING`: ~100 GB
  - Final Output Table:
    - `FINANCE_BW_FINAL`: ~200 GB
- **Processing Volume**:
  - Approximately 10% of the data from the input tables is processed in the queries.
  - Total data processed = 10% of (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB) = 10% of 3.1 TB = 310 GB.
- **Databricks Pricing**:
  - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
  - Assuming a moderate DBU cost of $0.45 per hour and a cluster with 8 nodes.
  - Processing time estimation: For 310 GB of data, assuming a processing speed of 50 GB/hour per node, the cluster would take approximately 310 GB / (50 GB/hour * 8 nodes) = ~0.775 hours.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - Total DBU hours = 0.775 hours * 8 nodes = 6.2 DBU hours.
  - Total cost = 6.2 DBU hours * $0.45/DBU = $2.79.

### 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
#### 2.1 PySpark Code Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
- Manual fixes for ABAP-to-PySpark conversion, handling temp tables, and calculations: ~10 hours.
- Unit testing individual transformations and data mappings: ~8 hours.

#### 2.2 Output Validation Effort:
- Integration testing to ensure the PySpark job integrates correctly with data sources and target tables: ~12 hours.
- Performance testing to measure execution time and resource utilization: ~6 hours.
- Validation testing to compare output data with expected results: ~10 hours.

#### 2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours:
- Total Testing Effort = 10 (manual fixes) + 8 (unit testing) + 12 (integration testing) + 6 (performance testing) + 10 (validation testing) = **36 hours**.

### Final Summary:
- **Estimated Cost of Running PySpark Code**: ~$2.79 per run.
- **Estimated Testing Effort**: ~36 hours.
- **API Cost**: $0.01 USD (assumed for this call).

This estimation provides a comprehensive understanding of the cost and effort involved in running and testing the PySpark code converted from ABAP scripts.
