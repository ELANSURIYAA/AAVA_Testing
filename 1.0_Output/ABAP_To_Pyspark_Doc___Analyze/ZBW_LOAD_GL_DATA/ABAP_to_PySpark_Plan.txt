1. **Cost Estimation**

   **1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost**
   - **Enterprise DBU Cost**: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
   - **Data Volume Processed**:
     - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB.
     - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB.
     - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB.
     - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB.
     - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB.
   - **Processing Volume**: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
   - **Calculation**:
     - Total data processed = 10% of (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB).
     - Total data processed = 10% of 3.3 TB = 0.33 TB = 330 GB.
     - Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.45/hour and 1 DBU processes 100 GB/hour:
       - Runtime = 330 GB / 100 GB/hour = 3.3 hours.
       - Cost = 3.3 hours * $0.45/hour = $1.485.
   - **Total PySpark Runtime Cost**: **$1.485 USD**.

2. **Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation**

   **2.1 PySpark Code Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort**
   - **Manual Adjustments**:
     - Replace ABAP file handling with PySpark's file reading methods.
     - Replace internal table operations with PySpark DataFrame operations.
     - Replace ABAP conditional logic and error handling with PySpark's exception handling.
     - Replace ABAP DML operations with PySpark's DataFrame write operations.
     - Replace ABAP string operations with PySpark's string manipulation functions.
   - **Effort Estimation**:
     - Syntax adjustments and replacements: 4 hours.
     - Testing and validation of temporary tables and calculations: 3 hours.
     - Total Effort: **7 hours**.

   **2.2 Output Validation Effort**
   - Compare the output from the ABAP script and PySpark script.
   - Validate data consistency, accuracy, and completeness.
   - Effort: **3 hours**.

   **2.3 Total Estimated Effort**
   - PySpark Code Fixes and Unit Testing: 7 hours.
   - Output Validation: 3 hours.
   - **Total Effort**: **10 hours**.
