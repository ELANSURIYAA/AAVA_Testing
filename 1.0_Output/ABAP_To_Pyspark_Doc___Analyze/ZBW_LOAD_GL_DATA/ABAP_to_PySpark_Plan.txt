Cost Estimation:

1. PySpark Runtime Cost:
   - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
   - Data Volume:
     - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB.
     - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB.
     - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB.
     - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB.
     - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB.
   - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
   - Calculation:
     - Total Data Processed: (10% of 2 TB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 100 GB) + (10% of 200 GB) = 200 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 330 GB.
     - Estimated Runtime: Assuming 1 DBU per hour for processing 100 GB, runtime for 330 GB = 3.3 hours.
     - Cost Range: 3.3 hours * $0.15 = $0.495 (minimum), 3.3 hours * $0.75 = $2.475 (maximum).
   - Reasons:
     - The cost is calculated based on the data volume processed and the DBU pricing range provided.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:

   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Areas of manual intervention:
         - Replace `OPEN DATASET` and `READ DATASET` with PySpark's file reading methods.
         - Replace `SPLIT` with PySpark's `split` function.
         - Replace `INSERT` with PySpark's `write` method.
         - Replace `COMMIT WORK` and `ROLLBACK WORK` with PySpark's implicit transaction handling.
       - Estimated Effort: 8 hours for code fixes and unit testing.

   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Validating data integrity and correctness.
       - Estimated Effort: 4 hours.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort: 8 hours (code fixes and unit testing) + 4 hours (output validation) = 12 hours.
       - Reasons:
         - The effort is based on the complexity of ABAP-to-PySpark conversion and the validation process.
