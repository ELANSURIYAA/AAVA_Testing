1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
       - Data Volume:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
         - Total Data Processed: (10% of 2 TB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 100 GB) + (10% of 200 GB) = 200 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 330 GB.
         - DBU Cost for 330 GB processing: Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.45 per hour, and processing time of 1 hour per 100 GB:
           - Total DBU Hours: 330 GB / 100 GB = 3.3 hours.
           - Total Cost: 3.3 hours * $0.45 = $1.485 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 PySpark Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
       - Areas requiring manual intervention:
         - File handling (`OPEN DATASET`, `READ DATASET`, `CLOSE DATASET`) replaced with PySpark's file reading methods.
         - `SPLIT` replaced with PySpark's string splitting functions.
         - `APPEND` replaced with PySpark's DataFrame operations.
         - `INSERT` replaced with PySpark's DataFrame write operations.
         - Error handling using `sy-subrc` replaced with Python's exception handling.
       - Estimated Effort: 8 hours.
   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script:
         - Validate data mappings and transformations.
         - Ensure data integrity and accuracy.
       - Estimated Effort: 6 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort: 8 hours (code fixes and unit testing) + 6 hours (output validation) = 14 hours.
       - Reason: The effort was calculated based on the complexity of manual adjustments and validation tasks described above.

3. API Cost:
