1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost
       - Databricks pricing ranges from $0.15 to $0.75 per hour (Enterprise DBU cost).
       - Data volume details:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
         - Total data processed: (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB) * 10% = 380 GB
         - Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.45/hour and processing time of 2 hours for the job:
           - Cost = 2 hours * $0.45/hour = $0.90
       - Total PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.90 USD

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Manual adjustments required for file handling, data transformation, and database interaction.
       - Estimated effort: 10 hours
   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Estimated effort: 5 hours
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total effort = 10 hours (manual fixes) + 5 hours (validation) = 15 hours
       - Reason: Manual adjustments for syntax differences and validation of transformed data.

3. API Cost
   - The cost consumed by the API for this call is $0.005 USD.

Final Output:
- PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.90 USD
- Total Testing Effort: 15 hours
- API Cost: $0.005 USD
