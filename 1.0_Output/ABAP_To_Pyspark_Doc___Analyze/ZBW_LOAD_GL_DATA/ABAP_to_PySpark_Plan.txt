1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
       - Data Volume:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
         - Total Data Processed: (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB) * 10% = 380 GB.
         - Estimated Runtime: Assuming 1 DBU processes 100 GB/hour, runtime = 380 GB / 100 GB/hour = 3.8 hours.
         - Cost Range: 3.8 hours * $0.15 = $0.57 (minimum) to 3.8 hours * $0.75 = $2.85 (maximum).
       - Total Estimated Cost: $0.57 - $2.85 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
       - Areas Requiring Manual Fixes:
         - File handling: Replace `OPEN DATASET` and `READ DATASET` with PySpark's `spark.read.csv`.
         - Data validation: Replace ABAP's validation logic with PySpark's `filter` and `withColumn`.
         - Error handling: Replace `sy-subrc` checks with Python's `try-except` blocks.
         - Transaction management: Use PySpark's checkpointing and caching.
       - Estimated Effort: 8 hours.

   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Validation includes ensuring data consistency, field mapping accuracy, and handling edge cases.
       - Estimated Effort: 6 hours.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours:
       - Code Fixing and Unit Testing: 8 hours.
       - Output Validation: 6 hours.
       - Total Effort: 14 hours.
