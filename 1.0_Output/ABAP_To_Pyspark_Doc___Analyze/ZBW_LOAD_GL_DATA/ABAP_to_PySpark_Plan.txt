The files `ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA.txt` and `ZBW_LOAD_GL_DATA_Environmental_Varible.txt` are not present in the directory. Please confirm their correct location or provide the correct file paths so I can proceed with the analysis. Without these files, I cannot estimate the cost and testing effort for the PySpark code converted from ABAP scripts. Let me know how to proceed.
