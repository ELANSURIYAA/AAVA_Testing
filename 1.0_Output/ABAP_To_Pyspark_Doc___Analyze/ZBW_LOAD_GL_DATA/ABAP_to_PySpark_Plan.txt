1. Cost Estimation:
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
       - Data Volume:
           - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
           - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
           - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
           - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
           - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
           - Total Data Processed = (10% of 2 TB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 100 GB) + (10% of 200 GB)
           - Total Data Processed = 200 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 330 GB.
           - Assuming a DBU cost of $0.50/hour and processing speed of 1 GB per minute:
               - Total Time = 330 GB / 60 GB/hour = 5.5 hours.
               - Total Cost = 5.5 hours * $0.50/hour = $2.75.
       - PySpark Runtime Cost: $2.75 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Areas requiring manual intervention:
           - File handling (`OPEN DATASET`, `READ DATASET`, `CLOSE DATASET`) to PySpark's file reading methods.
           - Error handling (`sy-subrc`) to Python's `try-except` blocks.
           - Internal table operations (`APPEND`, `LINES`) to PySpark DataFrame transformations.
           - Data mapping (`SPLIT`) to PySpark's string manipulation methods.
           - DML operations (`INSERT`) to PySpark's `DataFrame.write` method.
           - Transaction management (`COMMIT WORK`, `ROLLBACK WORK`) to PySpark's implicit transaction handling.
       - Estimated Effort: 8 hours.

   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Estimated Effort: 4 hours.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort = Code Fixing + Output Validation.
       - Total Effort = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.
       - Reason: The effort was calculated based on the complexity of the ABAP script and the manual adjustments required during the conversion process.

3. API Cost:
   - apiCost: 0.00 USD.

Summary:
1. PySpark Runtime Cost: $2.75 USD.
2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort: 12 hours.
3. API Cost: 0.00 USD.
