1. **Cost Estimation**

   **1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost**

   **Calculation Breakup:**
   - **Enterprise DBU Cost:** $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
   - **Data Volume:** 
     - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
     - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
     - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
     - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
     - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
   - **Processing Volume:** Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.

   **Reasons:**
   - The runtime cost is calculated based on the data volume processed and the DBU cost range provided.
   - For 10% processing of the given data volumes:
     - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: 200 GB
     - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: 50 GB
     - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: 50 GB
     - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: 10 GB
     - FINANCE_BW_FINAL: 20 GB
   - Total data processed: 330 GB.
   - Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.45 per hour and processing time of 1 hour per 100 GB:
     - Runtime cost = (330 GB / 100 GB) * $0.45 = $1.485.

   **Estimated PySpark Runtime Cost:** $1.485 USD.

2. **Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation**

   **2.1 PySpark Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort**
   - **Effort Areas:** 
     - Manual adjustments for syntax differences (e.g., file handling, conditional logic, data validation).
     - Unit testing for temporary tables, calculations, and ABAP-to-PySpark conversions.
   - **Estimated Effort:** 8 hours.

   **2.2 Output Validation Effort**
   - **Effort Areas:** 
     - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
     - Validating data integrity and accuracy.
   - **Estimated Effort:** 6 hours.

   **2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours**
   - **Reason:** 
     - The total effort is derived from the sum of manual code fixes, unit testing, and output validation efforts.
     - Total Estimated Effort = 8 hours (code fixes and unit testing) + 6 hours (output validation) = 14 hours.

**API Cost:** 0.00 USD.
