1. **Cost Estimation**:
   - **PySpark Runtime Cost**:
     - **Databricks Pricing**:
       - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
     - **Data Volume**:
       - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB.
       - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB.
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
     - **Runtime Estimation**:
       - Assuming a cluster with 8 nodes, each consuming 1 DBU per hour, and processing 10% of 2 TB (~200 GB) and 500 GB (~50 GB) for aggregation:
         - Total Data Processed: 250 GB.
         - Estimated Runtime: 2 hours (based on typical Spark processing speeds for such volumes).
       - **Cost Range**: 8 nodes × 2 hours × $0.15 to $0.75 = **$2.40 to $12.00**.

2. **Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation**:
   - **PySpark Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort**:
     - Effort required to adapt the ABAP logic to PySpark, including handling file reading, data transformations, and error handling.
     - **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days.
   - **Output Validation Effort**:
     - Compare the output of the PySpark code with the expected results to ensure accuracy.
     - **Estimated Effort**: 2 days.
   - **Total Estimated Effort in Hours**:
     - **5-7 days** (40-56 hours).
     - This includes manual code fixes, unit testing, and output validation.

3. **API Cost**:
   - **apiCost**: 0.003 USD.

This estimation provides a comprehensive understanding of the cost and effort required for the PySpark code conversion and testing.
