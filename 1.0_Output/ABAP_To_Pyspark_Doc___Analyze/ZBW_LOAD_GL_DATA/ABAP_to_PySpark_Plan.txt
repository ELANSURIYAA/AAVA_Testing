1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Enterprise DBU cost ranges from $0.15 to $0.75 per hour.
       - Data volume processed:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB (10% processed = 200 GB)
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB (10% processed = 50 GB)
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB (10% processed = 50 GB)
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB (10% processed = 10 GB)
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL: ~200 GB (10% processed = 20 GB)
       - Total data processed: 330 GB.
       - Estimated runtime: 5 hours (based on data volume and complexity).
       - Cost calculation:
         - Minimum cost: 5 hours * $0.15 = $0.75
         - Maximum cost: 5 hours * $0.75 = $3.75
       - PySpark runtime cost: $0.75 - $3.75 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Manual code fixes for syntax differences and temporary tables: 10 hours.
       - Unit testing for calculations and ABAP-to-PySpark conversions: 15 hours.
       - Total: 25 hours.
   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing ABAP script output with PySpark script output: 10 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total effort: 25 hours (code fixes + unit testing) + 10 hours (output validation) = 35 hours.
       - Reason: The effort accounts for manual intervention, testing of temporary tables, and validating the output for accuracy.
