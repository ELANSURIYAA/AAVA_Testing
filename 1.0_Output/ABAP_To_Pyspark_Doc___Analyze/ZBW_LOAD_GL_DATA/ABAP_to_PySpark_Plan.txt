1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost
       - Databricks Pricing (DBU - Databricks Units): $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
       - Data Volume:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
         - Total data processed: (10% of 2 TB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 100 GB) + (10% of 200 GB) = 200 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 330 GB.
         - Runtime cost for processing 330 GB:
           - Assuming a mid-range DBU cost of $0.45/hour and processing speed of 1 TB/hour:
             - Runtime = 330 GB / 1024 GB/hour = ~0.32 hours.
             - Cost = 0.32 hours * $0.45/hour = $0.144.
       - Total PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.144 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Areas requiring manual intervention:
         - File handling syntax replacement.
         - Data validation logic adaptation.
         - Mapping CSV fields to DataFrame columns.
         - Database write operations.
       - Estimated effort: 8 hours.
   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Estimated effort: 6 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours:
       - Total effort = 8 hours (manual fixes) + 6 hours (validation) = 14 hours.
       - Reason: The effort accounts for syntax differences, manual adjustments, and validation of outputs.

3. API Cost
   - apiCost: 0.00 USD (no external API costs incurred for this analysis).
