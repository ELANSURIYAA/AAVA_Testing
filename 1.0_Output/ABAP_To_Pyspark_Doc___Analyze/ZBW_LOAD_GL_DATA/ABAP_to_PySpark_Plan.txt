1. Cost Estimation:
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Calculation Breakup:
         - Data Volume Processed: Approximately 10% of the total data volume (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB = 3.3 TB).
         - Processed Data Volume: 10% of 3.3 TB = 330 GB.
         - DBU Pricing: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
         - Runtime Cost: Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.50 per hour and processing time of 4.5 hours, the runtime cost is $2.25.
       - Reasons:
         - The cost is based on the average DBU pricing and estimated processing time for the given data volume.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 PySpark Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
       - Effort: 20 hours.
       - Reasons:
         - Manual adjustments required for syntax differences (e.g., file handling, internal table manipulations, conditional logic, schema validation, and data insertion).
         - Unit testing effort for validating transformations and temporary table calculations.

   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
       - Effort: 10 hours.
       - Reasons:
         - Comparing outputs from ABAP and PySpark scripts to ensure accuracy and consistency.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort: 30 hours.
       - Reasons:
         - Sum of manual code fixing, unit testing, and output validation efforts.

3. API Cost:
   - Cost: $0.001 USD.

Final Output:
- PySpark Runtime Cost: $2.25 USD.
- Total Testing Effort: 30 hours.
- API Cost: $0.001 USD.
