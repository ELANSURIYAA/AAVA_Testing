1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
       - Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
       - Data Volume:
           - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
           - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
           - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
           - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
           - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
           - Total Data Processed: (10% of 2 TB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 500 GB) + (10% of 100 GB) + (10% of 200 GB)
           - Total Data Processed = 200 GB + 50 GB + 50 GB + 10 GB + 20 GB = 330 GB.
           - DBU Cost Range: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour.
           - Assuming processing takes 1 hour per 100 GB:
               - Total Processing Time = 330 GB / 100 GB = 3.3 hours.
               - Cost Range = 3.3 hours * $0.15 to 3.3 hours * $0.75.
               - Cost Range = $0.495 - $2.475.
       - PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.495 - $2.475 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Areas requiring manual intervention:
           - Temporary tables and calculations.
           - ABAP-to-PySpark syntax differences.
           - Field mapping and validation logic.
       - Estimated Effort: 8 hours.

   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script.
       - Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
       - Estimated Effort: 4 hours.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort = Code Fixing + Output Validation.
       - Total Effort = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.
       - Reason: The effort was calculated based on the complexity of the ABAP script, the number of temporary tables, and the need for thorough validation.

API Cost: 0.01 USD.

Final Output:
1. PySpark Runtime Cost: $0.495 - $2.475 USD.
2. Total Testing Effort: 12 hours.
3. API Cost: 0.01 USD.
