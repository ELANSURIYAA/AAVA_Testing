1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost
       - Databricks Pricing: $0.15 - $0.75 per hour (Enterprise DBU Cost).
       - Data Volume:
         - FINANCE_DATA_RAW: ~2 TB
         - FINANCE_AGGREGATE: ~500 GB
         - COST_CENTER_LOOKUP: ~500 GB
         - GL_ACCOUNT_MAPPING: ~100 GB
         - FINANCE_BW_FINAL (Final Output Table): ~200 GB
       - Processing Volume: Approximately 10% of the data from the tables is processed in the queries.
       - Calculation:
         - Total Data Processed: (2 TB + 500 GB + 500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB) * 10% = 380 GB
         - Estimated Runtime: Assuming 1 hour per 100 GB of data processed, runtime = 380 GB / 100 GB = 3.8 hours.
         - Cost: 3.8 hours * $0.75 (upper limit of DBU cost) = $2.85 USD.
       - Total Estimated Cost: $2.85 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 PySpark code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Manual code fixes for syntax differences, handling temporary tables, and ABAP-to-PySpark conversions: 4 hours.
       - Unit testing for various temp tables and calculations: 3 hours.
       - Total Effort: 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
   2.2 Output validation effort:
       - Comparing the output from ABAP script and PySpark script: 3 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort: 7 (code fixing and unit testing) + 3 (output validation) = 10 hours.
       - Reason: Effort includes manual fixes, testing, and validation to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
