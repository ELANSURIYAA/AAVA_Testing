1. Overview of Program:
   - Purpose: The ABAP program `zload_finance_to_bw` is designed to load financial data from a CSV file located on the application server into an SAP BW table. This facilitates reporting and analysis within SAP BW.
   - Business Problem: The program addresses the need for automated data integration between external financial systems and SAP BW, ensuring accurate and timely data availability for business intelligence purposes.

2. Code Structure and Design:
   - Structure: The program is structured as a report with the following components:
     - Internal Tables: `lt_file_data`, `lt_bw_data`, `ls_bw_data`.
     - File Handling Variables: `lv_filename`, `lv_line`, `lt_fields`.
     - Processing Logic: File reading, data transformation, and insertion into SAP BW table.
   - Primary ABAP Components:
     - Reports: `zload_finance_to_bw`.
     - Internal Tables: `lt_file_data`, `lt_bw_data`, `ls_bw_data`.
     - Subroutines: None explicitly defined; logic is implemented directly in the report.
     - Classes: None used.

3. Data Flow and Processing Logic:
   - Processing Logic:
     - File Reading: Opens the dataset `finance_data.csv` for input and reads data line by line.
     - Data Transformation: Splits each line into fields and maps them to the SAP BW structure `zbw_finance_data`.
     - Data Validation: Ensures the correct number of fields (7) per line and logs errors for incorrect formats.
     - Data Insertion: Inserts transformed data into the SAP BW table `zbw_finance_data`.
   - Transformations:
     - Splitting: Splits each line into fields using the delimiter ','.
     - Mapping: Maps fields to corresponding columns in the SAP BW structure.
     - Validation: Checks the number of fields and logs errors for discrepancies.

4. Data Mapping:
   - Target Table Name: `zbw_finance_data`

     | amount             | lt_fields         | [5]                | 1 to 1 mapping             |
     | currency           | lt_fields         | [6]                | 1 to 1 mapping             |
     | posting_date       | lt_fields         | [7]                | 1 to 1 mapping             |
