### **1. Physical Layer DDL Script:**
Here is the DDL script to create the physical table in Google BigQuery. The model uses nested structures (`STRUCT`) for one-to-one relationships and a repeated structure (`ARRAY<STRUCT>`) for the one-to-many relationship, which is an optimal design for BigQuery.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_dataset.Member (
    memberId STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier assigned to each member."),
    personal_info STRUCT<
        firstName STRING OPTIONS(description="The first name of the member."),
        lastName STRING OPTIONS(description="The last name of the member."),
        dateOfBirth DATE OPTIONS(description="The member's date of birth.")
    > OPTIONS(description="Contains the member’s personal identification details."),
    contact STRUCT<
        email STRING OPTIONS(description="The member's primary email address."),
        phone STRING OPTIONS(description="The member's phone number.")
    > OPTIONS(description="Stores the member’s contact information."),
    membership STRUCT<
        tier STRING OPTIONS(description="The level of membership."),
        startDate DATE OPTIONS(description="The date when the membership commenced."),
        renewalDate DATE OPTIONS(description="The date when the membership is due for renewal."),
        status STRING OPTIONS(description="The current status of the membership.")
    > OPTIONS(description="Holds details about the member’s subscription."),
    activity_log ARRAY<STRUCT<
        activityId STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier for each activity log entry."),
        date DATE OPTIONS(description="The date of the activity."),
        description STRING OPTIONS(description="A brief description of the activity.")
    >> OPTIONS(description="Records member interactions and activities.")
);
```

### **2. Column Documentation Table:**
