2. Verify the equivalent CAST() function in BigQuery SQL.
Expected Result: Type casting is correctly converted to BigQuery syntax.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

Test Case ID: TC003
Description: Validate ARRAY_AGG function conversion.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.
Test Steps:
1. Identify ARRAY_AGG usage in Snowflake SQL.
2. Verify the equivalent syntax in BigQuery SQL.
Expected Result: ARRAY_AGG function is correctly converted to BigQuery syntax.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

Test Case ID: TC004
Description: Validate window function syntax conversion.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.

Test Case ID: TC005
Description: Validate CLUSTER BY clause conversion.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.
Test Steps:
1. Identify CLUSTER BY clause in Snowflake SQL.
2. Verify the equivalent clustering approach in BigQuery SQL.
Expected Result: CLUSTER BY clause is correctly adapted for BigQuery.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

Test Case ID: TC006
Description: Validate semi-structured data handling.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.
Test Steps:
1. Identify semi-structured data handling in Snowflake SQL.
2. Verify the equivalent handling in BigQuery SQL.
Expected Result: Semi-structured data is correctly handled in BigQuery.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

Test Case ID: TC007
Description: Validate overall functionality equivalence.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.
Test Steps:
1. Execute the Snowflake SQL query and save the results.
2. Execute the BigQuery SQL query and save the results.
3. Compare the results for equivalence.
Expected Result: Results from Snowflake and BigQuery queries are equivalent.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]

Test Case ID: TC008
Description: Validate performance comparison.
Preconditions: Snowflake SQL query and converted BigQuery SQL query are available.
Test Steps:
1. Measure execution time for the Snowflake SQL query.
2. Measure execution time for the BigQuery SQL query.
3. Compare the execution times.
Expected Result: Execution times are within acceptable limits.
Actual Result: [To be filled after execution]
Pass/Fail Status: [To be filled after execution]
