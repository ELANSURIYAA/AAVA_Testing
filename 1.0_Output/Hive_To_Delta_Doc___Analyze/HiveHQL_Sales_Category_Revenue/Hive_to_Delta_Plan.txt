1. Cost Estimation
   2.1 Delta Runtime Cost 
         - Total Data Processed: 450 GB
         - Runtime Estimation: 2 hours
         - DBU Cost: $0.45/hour
         - Runtime Cost: $0.90 USD
         - Reasons: The runtime estimation accounts for the script complexity and data volume processed. The average DBU cost is used for calculation.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation
   2.1 Delta Code Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
         - Manual Fixes: 2 hours
         - Unit Testing: 4 hours
         - Output Validation: 3 hours
         - Total Effort: 9 hours
         - Reasons: Manual fixes are minimal due to low complexity of the Hive script. Unit testing covers all temporary tables and calculations. Output validation ensures accuracy of the migrated queries.
