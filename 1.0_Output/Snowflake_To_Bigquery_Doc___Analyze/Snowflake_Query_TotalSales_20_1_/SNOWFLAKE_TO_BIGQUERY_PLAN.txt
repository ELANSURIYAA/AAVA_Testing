1. Cost Estimation:
   1.1 BigQuery Runtime Cost:
       - Pricing: $5 per TB scanned.
       - Data Volume:
         - CUSTOMERS_DF: ~1.5 TB
         - SALES_DF: ~2 TB
         - PRODUCTS_DF: ~500 GB
         - FINAL_OUTPUT: ~300 GB
       - Total Data Processed: 10% of the total data volume.
         - CUSTOMERS_DF: 1.5 TB * 10% = 0.15 TB
         - SALES_DF: 2 TB * 10% = 0.2 TB
         - PRODUCTS_DF: 0.5 TB * 10% = 0.05 TB
         - FINAL_OUTPUT: 0.3 TB * 10% = 0.03 TB
       - Total Data Scanned: 0.15 + 0.2 + 0.05 + 0.03 = 0.43 TB
       - Cost: 0.43 TB * $5 = $2.15 USD.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 BigQuery Code Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
       - Number of Syntax Differences: 8
       - Estimated Effort: 2 hours per syntax difference.
       - Total Effort: 8 * 2 = 16 hours.

   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
       - Comparing the output from Snowflake script and BigQuery script.
       - Estimated Effort: 10 hours.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
       - Total Effort = Manual Fixes + Output Validation.
       - Total Effort = 16 + 10 = 26 hours.

   - Reason for Total Effort:
     - The manual fixes involve adapting Snowflake-specific syntax to BigQuery.
     - Output validation requires comparing results from both environments to ensure accuracy.

3. API Cost:
   - apiCost: 0.000 USD.

Summary:
- BigQuery Runtime Cost: $2.15 USD.
- Total Testing Effort: 26 hours.
