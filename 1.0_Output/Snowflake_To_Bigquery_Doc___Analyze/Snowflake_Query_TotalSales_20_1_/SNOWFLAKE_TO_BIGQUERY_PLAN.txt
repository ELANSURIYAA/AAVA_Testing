1. Cost Estimation:
   1.1 BigQuery Runtime Cost:
       - Total data volume processed: ~0.43 TB.
       - BigQuery On-Demand Query Cost: $5 per TB scanned.
       - Estimated cost for 0.43 TB: 0.43 * $5 = $2.15 USD.
       - Reason: The calculation is based on the data volume processed (10% of the total data) and the pricing details provided.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 BigQuery code manual code fixes and unit testing effort:
       - Estimated effort: ~8-12 hours.
       - Reason: Moderate complexity due to syntax differences, including replacing Snowflake-specific functions (e.g., JSON field extraction, ARRAY_AGG) and removing unsupported directives like CLUSTER BY.

   2.2 Output validation effort comparing the output from Snowflake script and BigQuery script:
       - Estimated effort: ~12-16 hours.
       - Reason: Includes validating syntax changes, ensuring data consistency, and comparing outputs between Snowflake and BigQuery.

   2.3 Total Estimated Effort in Hours:
       - Total effort: ~20-28 hours.
       - Reason: The total effort is the sum of code fixing and testing efforts, accounting for the complexity of syntax changes and the need for thorough validation.
