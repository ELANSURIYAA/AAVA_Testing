I am unable to generate the required .lvdash.json output because the necessary input files (DataModelSchema.txt and Layout.txt) are empty or missing. Only the sample .lvdash.json file is available, which is insufficient for the migration. Please provide the actual contents or correct file paths for DataModelSchema.txt and Layout.txt to proceed with the Power BI to Databricks Lakeview dashboard migration.
