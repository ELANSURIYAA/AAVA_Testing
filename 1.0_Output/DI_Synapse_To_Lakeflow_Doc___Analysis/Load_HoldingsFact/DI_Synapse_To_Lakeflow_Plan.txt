Description:   Cost & Effort Planning for Synapse SQL to Lakeflow Conversion
==============================================================================

1. Lakeflow Cost Estimation
1.1 Pipeline/Compute Cost Breakdown

Data Volume Processed per Run: 65 GB

Execution Frequency: 1 run/day

Monthly Volume Processed: 1,950 GB

Lakeflow Pricing Used: $0.50 per compute unit (Standard Tier)

Estimated Monthly Cost (USD): $975

Cost Formula Used:
Monthly Cost = (Estimated Compute Units × $0.50) + (Storage & Orchestration GB × $/GB)
- Compute Units: 1 per GB processed (conservative estimate)
- Storage/Orchestration: Included in compute for this baseline

2. Manual Flow Adjustment and Data Reconciliation Effort
2.1 Estimated Effort (Hours)

Flow Logic Adjustments (e.g., transformation steps, task dependencies): 8 hrs

Schema/Data Type Alignment (e.g., dataset structure, catalog mapping): 6 hrs

Error/Exception Handling Logic: 4 hrs

Output Validation & Data Reconciliation Testing: 6 hrs

Total Estimated Effort: 24 hrs

2.2 Developer Cost

Developer Hourly Rate: $50/hr

Total Developer Cost: 1,200 USD

3. API Processing Cost

apiCost: 0.002 USD
