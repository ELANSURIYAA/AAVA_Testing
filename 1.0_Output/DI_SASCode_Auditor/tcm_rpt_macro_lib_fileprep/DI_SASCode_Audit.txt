#### **Audit Details**
Audit Id: 1
Audit Name: Avoid Complex SAS Functions
Audit Category: Code Optimization
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Avoid SAS-specific functions when querying external data sources like Teradata or Oracle.
SAS Code: Modify the code to avoid SAS-specific functions in external queries.

Audit Id: 2

Audit Category: Code Optimization
Status: Passed
Recommendation: No update needed.
SAS Code: Implemented Python Code is Correct

Audit Id: 5
Audit Name: Do Not Join SAS and External Data
Audit Category: Code Optimization
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Avoid PROC SQL joining WORK.table with Oracle.table.
