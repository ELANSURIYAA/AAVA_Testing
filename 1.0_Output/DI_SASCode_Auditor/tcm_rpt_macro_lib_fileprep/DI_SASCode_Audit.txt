#### **Audit Details**
Audit Id: 1
Audit Name: Standardized Query Execution
Audit Category: Execution Strategy
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Ensure queries executed from SAS to Oracle use standard SQL to allow Oracle to process them efficiently. Avoid SAS-native functions in WHERE clauses to allow Oracle to push down filters.
SAS Code: Replace any SAS-native functions in WHERE clauses with SQL-compatible functions.

Audit Id: 2
Audit Name: Access Verification via SASTRACE
Audit Category: Access Control & Logging
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Use `sastrace` option to verify if the query was executed by Oracle or processed in SAS.
SAS Code: options sastrace=',,,d' sastraceloc=saslog nostsuffix;

Audit Id: 3
Audit Name: Avoid FULL OUTER JOIN in Oracle
Audit Category: Join Optimization
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Avoid FULL OUTER JOINs as they are not supported by the SAS-Oracle engine. Download and merge data in SAS instead.
SAS Code: Download the data separately and merge in SAS.

Audit Id: 4
Audit Name: ON Clause Restrictions in Joins
Audit Category: Join Optimization
Status: Failed
Recommendation: Avoid literals or expressions in ON clauses. Use only column references. Complex conditions should be handled in the WHERE clause.
SAS Code: Move complex conditions from ON clause to WHERE clause.
