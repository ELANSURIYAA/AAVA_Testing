Thought: I now have the content of the original Hive SQL script and the converted Delta Lake SQL script. I will analyze both scripts to identify their structure, target tables, and any differences in syntax or functionality. This analysis will guide the development of the Python script.

Action: Analyze the differences between the Hive and Delta scripts to identify key changes.
