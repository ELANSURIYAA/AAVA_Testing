```
Thought: The content of the file `/app/ec135cf9-2c2d-4a52-8a37-7a8fc5e896d0/tmp0kltq0zn/tmp5_gd3hvl` appears to be the original Hive script. I will now proceed to analyze the differences between the original Hive script and the converted Delta script to identify syntax changes, manual interventions, and functionality equivalence.
Action: Analyze the differences between the Hive and Delta scripts to identify key changes.
