# Data Flow Analysis
## Data Sources
- **Source Type**: CSV file  
- **File Path**: `/path/to/source_file.csv`  
- **Delimiter**: `,`  
- **Header Row**: Yes  

## Data Targets
- **Target Type**: Snowflake database  
- **Target Table**: `target_table`  
- **File Format**: CSV

# Transformation Logic Review
## Transformation Steps
1. **Filter Data**: Retain rows where the `status` column is `active`.
2. **Rename Column**: Change `old_column_name` to `new_column_name`.

## Data Quality Checks
- No explicit data quality checks are implemented.

## Efficiency
- The transformation operations are straightforward but could be optimized for scalability.

---

# Scheduling and Orchestration
## Trigger Mechanism
- The job runs sequentially: Read Source File → Transform Data → Load Data to Snowflake.

## Dependencies
- No dependencies on other jobs or external processes.

## Error Handling
- Errors during data load are logged, and processing continues.

---

# Security and Compliance Assessment
## Data Encryption
- Snowflake handles data encryption during storage and transfer.

## Access Control
- Access to the Snowflake database is managed through connection credentials.

## Sensitive Data Handling
- No sensitive data is explicitly mentioned.

## Compliance
- The job adheres to standard practices for data handling but lacks explicit compliance checks.

---

# Optimization Recommendations
## Job Structure
- Consider breaking the job into smaller, modular components for better maintainability.

## Performance
- Optimize filtering and renaming operations for larger datasets.
- Implement data quality checks to ensure accuracy.

## Error Handling
- Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide detailed error reporting.

## Monitoring
- Add monitoring tools to track job performance and resource utilization.
