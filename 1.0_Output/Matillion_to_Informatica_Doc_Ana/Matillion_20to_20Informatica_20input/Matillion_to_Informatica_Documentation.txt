# Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview
This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Matillion ETL project named "FileToSnowflakeMappingJob". The project is designed to extract data from a CSV file, transform it, and load it into a Snowflake database.

## 1.2 Scope of Documentation
The documentation aims to serve as a reference guide for developers, data engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the data integration process. It includes details on the job structure, components, data sources, transformations, and configurations.

# Matillion Project Structure

## 2.1 Job Hierarchy
The project consists of a single orchestration job named "FileToSnowflakeMappingJob".

## 2.2 Component Overview
- **Read Source File**: Reads data from a CSV file.
- **Transform Data**: Applies transformations such as filtering and renaming columns.
- **Load Data to Snowflake**: Loads the transformed data into a Snowflake database.

---

# Data Sources and Targets
- **Data Source**: CSV file located at `/path/to/source_file.csv`.
- **Data Target**: Snowflake database table named `target_table`.

---

# Job Documentation

## 4.1 Job Name and Purpose
**Job Name**: FileToSnowflakeMappingJob  
**Purpose**: Extract data from a CSV file, transform it, and load it into a Snowflake database.

## 4.2 Input Data
- **File Format**: CSV  
- **File Path**: `/path/to/source_file.csv`  
- **Delimiter**: `,`  
- **Header Row**: Yes  

## 4.3 Transformation Steps
1. **Filter Data**: Retain rows where the `status` column is `active`.
2. **Rename Column**: Change `old_column_name` to `new_column_name`.

## 4.4 Output Data
- **Target Table**: `target_table`  
- **File Format**: CSV  

## 4.5 Error Handling
- **On Error**: Continue processing.

## 4.6 Performance Considerations
- Bulk load operations are used for efficient data loading into Snowflake.

---

# Custom Scripts and SQL Queries
No custom scripts or SQL queries are used in this job.

---

# Scheduling and Orchestration
The job is orchestrated to run sequentially:
1. Read Source File → 2. Transform Data → 3. Load Data to Snowflake.

---

# Configuration and Parameters
### Variables
- `source_file_path`: `/path/to/source_file.csv`
- `snowflake_stage`: `my_snowflake_stage`
- `target_table`: `my_snowflake_target_table`

---

# Logging and Monitoring
- Logs are generated for each task execution.
- Errors are logged with timestamps for troubleshooting.

---

# Performance Optimization
- Bulk load operations are employed for efficient data transfer to Snowflake.
- Filtering and column renaming are performed during transformation to minimize data processing time.

---

# Known Limitations and Future Improvements
### Limitations
- The job currently supports only CSV file formats.
- Error handling is limited to continuing processing without detailed error reporting.

### Future Improvements
- Add support for additional file formats.
- Enhance error handling mechanisms for better troubleshooting.

---

# Setup and Execution Instructions
1. Configure the variables:
   - `source_file_path`
   - `snowflake_stage`
   - `target_table`
2. Run the job from the Matillion interface.

---

# Glossary of Terms
- **Snowflake**: A cloud-based data warehouse.
- **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load.
- **Bulk Load**: A method for efficiently loading large datasets.

### Input Data
| old_column_name | status |
|-----------------|--------|
| Value1          | active |
| Value2          | inactive |

### Output Data
| new_column_name | status |
