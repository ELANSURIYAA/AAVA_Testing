Description: Loads the FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY table with summarized holding metrics from staging data.
================================

Error: The actual Databricks-converted code (SQL or PySpark) for the LOAD_FACT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY procedure is not present in the provided files. Only the original Synapse SQL and an analysis document are available. 

To generate comprehensive unit tests and a Pytest script, I require the Databricks implementation (SQL or PySpark) that performs the data loading, transformation, and business rule enforcement as described.

Please provide the Databricks-converted code so I can proceed with test case design and Pytest script generation.
