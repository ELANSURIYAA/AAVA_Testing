Thought: The file "/app/06229b16-2d3e-40e0-9ee5-7ce77333d5a2/tmpnokklcfq/tmpy_0z6mq_" contains the original Synapse stored procedure logic and all necessary metadata for a thorough review. I now have both the original Synapse logic and the Fabric SQL code (provided in the user prompt). I can now synthesize the required review and validation sections as per the instructions.
