The Python script provided replicates the Alteryx workflow functionality described in the documentation. It reads input data, performs data cleansing and transformations, merges datasets, and loads the data into a star-schema data warehouse using pandas and SQLAlchemy. The script is optimized for CI/CD compatibility, handles edge cases like missing values and duplicates, and uses parameterized environment variables for flexibility. It is ready for execution as a standalone validation job or integration into CI/CD pipelines.
