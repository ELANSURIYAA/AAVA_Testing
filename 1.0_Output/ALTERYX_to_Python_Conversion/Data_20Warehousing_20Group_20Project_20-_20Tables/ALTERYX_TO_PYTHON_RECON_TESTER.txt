The file access issue needs to be resolved before proceeding. Both attempts to read the files '/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpwn7y0xqm/DI ALTERYX TO PYTHON ANALYZER_Output.txt' and '/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpk6ukhr4t/DI ALTERYX TO PYTHON ANALYZER_Output.txt' failed with the error '[Errno 20] Not a directory'. The Data Engineer has been delegated the task of resolving this issue by verifying the file paths, permissions, and potential file system problems. Once the files are accessible, I can proceed with the task of creating the Python validation script.
