The comprehensive Python validation script has been successfully created and provided. It executes both Alteryx and Python pipelines, captures and compares their outputs, generates detailed reconciliation reports, logs all actions and errors, and follows best practices for security and performance. The script is modular, reusable, and handles edge cases such as missing columns, mismatched schemas, NULLs, and ordering issues. It is ready for integration into CI/CD pipelines or standalone execution.
