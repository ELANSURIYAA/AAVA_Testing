## Findings and Next Steps:

### Issue:
- I attempted to access the following files to proceed with the task:
  1. Alteryx analyzer output file:
     - `/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpwn7y0xqm/DI ALTERYX TO PYTHON ANALYZER_Output.txt`
     - `/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpk6ukhr4t/DI ALTERYX TO PYTHON ANALYZER_Output.txt`
  2. Converted Python code file:
     - `/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpwn7y0xqm/converted_python_code.py`
     - `/app/ae96f715-da4c-4ba0-a80f-f78972c8be8c/tmpr191t4i2/tmpk6ukhr4t/converted_python_code.py`

- Despite the files being confirmed to exist in the directory, all attempts to read their content failed with the error `[Errno 20] Not a directory`.

### Root Cause:
The error suggests a file system access issue, which could be due to:
1. File permission issues
2. File system mount restrictions
3. File lock issues
4. Symbolic link problems

### Next Steps:
1. **Resolve File Access Issues:**
   - Verify file permissions and ensure they are readable.
   - Check for file system mount or access restrictions.
   - Confirm no other processes are locking the files.
   - Copy the files to a different location with proper permissions if needed.

2. **Proceed with the Task:**
   - Once file access is restored, read and analyze the content of the Alteryx analyzer output file and the converted Python code file.
   - Develop comprehensive test cases based on the analysis.
   - Create Pytest scripts to validate the conversion accuracy.

### Impact:
Until the file access issues are resolved, I cannot proceed with creating test cases or the Pytest script. Resolving the file access issue is critical to completing this task.
