# Data Warehousing Group Project - Tables
---

## 1. Workflow Overview

This Alteryx workflow is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data for a Data Warehousing project focused on language learning traces. The workflow processes raw CSV and text files, cleans and transforms the data, and loads it into a star-schema data warehouse with dimension and fact tables. The main business objective is to enable robust reporting and analytics on user learning traces, lexemes, and related linguistic features, providing actionable insights for educational product improvement.

**Business Problem Solved:**  
The workflow standardizes and structures disparate language learning trace data, making it suitable for advanced analytics and reporting. It ensures data quality, consistency, and referential integrity, supporting downstream BI and data science initiatives.

## 4. Syntax Differences

- Alteryx uses GUI-based configurations for tools, while Python requires explicit coding.
- Alteryx's Text to Columns tool directly splits fields, whereas Python requires string manipulation.
- Alteryx's Multi-Field Formula applies transformations across multiple fields, which in Python would require looping or vectorized operations.
- SQL post-processing in Alteryx is integrated, while Python would need separate SQL execution scripts.

---

## 5. Manual Adjustments

- Replace Alteryx-specific tools like Multi-Field Formula with pandas or PySpark equivalents.
- Rewrite SQL post-processing scripts using Python libraries like SQLAlchemy or pyodbc.
- Implement error handling and logging mechanisms in Python.
- Adjust for differences in string manipulation and conditional logic syntax.

## 6. Conversion Complexity

- **Complexity Score:** 68/100
- **High-Complexity Areas:** 
  - SQL post-processing
  - Multi-Field Formula transformations
  - Conditional logic implementation
- **Moderate-Complexity Areas:**
  - Joins and data blending
  - Dimension and fact table preparation

---

## 7. Optimization Techniques

- Use pandas for small to medium datasets; switch to PySpark for large-scale data.
- Optimize joins and aggregations using efficient indexing and partitioning.
- Refactor the workflow to minimize intermediate data writes and leverage in-memory processing.
- Consider rebuilding the workflow in Python for better performance and maintainability.
