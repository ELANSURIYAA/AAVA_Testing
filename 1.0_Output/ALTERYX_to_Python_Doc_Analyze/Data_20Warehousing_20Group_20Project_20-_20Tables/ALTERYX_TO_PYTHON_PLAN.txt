# Cost Estimation and Testing Effort for Python Migration from Alteryx

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Python Runtime Cost

Based on the analysis of the Alteryx workflow complexity and the Python conversion requirements, I estimate the following costs:

**Compute Resources:**
- Processing 13M+ records from learning_traces.csv: $0.15 per execution
- Memory requirements for data transformations: $0.10 per execution
- Temporary storage for intermediate results: $0.05 per execution

**Data Processing Costs:**
- ETL operations (text processing, joins, aggregations): $0.20 per execution
- Database operations (SQL table creation and population): $0.25 per execution

**Total Estimated Cost per Execution: $0.75**

**Monthly Cost Estimation (assuming daily execution):**
- 30 executions × $0.75 = $22.50 per month

## 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 Identified Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort

**Data Transformation Logic (18 hours):**
- String manipulation functions (Replace, TitleCase, etc.): 6 hours
- Text-to-columns conversion logic: 4 hours
- Multi-field formula conversion to Python equivalents: 8 hours

**Database Integration (12 hours):**
- ODBC connection setup in Python: 4 hours
- SQL post-processing script conversion: 6 hours
- Transaction management and error handling: 2 hours

**Data Reconciliation Testing (24 hours):**
- Dimension table output validation: 8 hours
- Fact table relationship validation: 8 hours
- Data quality checks and edge case testing: 8 hours

**Performance Optimization (10 hours):**
- Memory usage optimization: 4 hours
- Processing speed improvements: 4 hours
- Error handling and logging implementation: 2 hours

**Total Estimated Effort: 64 hours**
