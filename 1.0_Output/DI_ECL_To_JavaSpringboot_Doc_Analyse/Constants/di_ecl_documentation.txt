{
  "1. Overview of Program": "This ECL script defines a module named 'Constants' that exports two constants: 'NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit'. It serves as a centralized location for these values, which can be reused across other parts of the ECL codebase. The script addresses the need for consistent and maintainable configuration management within the system. It does not directly connect to external systems but provides foundational values for other modules or scripts.",
  "2. Code Structure and Design": "The script is structured as a single module named 'Constants'. This module encapsulates two constants: 'NotFoundStatus', a string indicating a 'not found' status, and 'MaxJoinLimit', an integer specifying the maximum limit for join operations. The module is designed for simplicity and reusability, allowing other scripts to import and use these constants without duplication.",
  "3. Data Flow and Processing Logic": {
    "Processed Datasets": [],
    "Data Flow": "This script does not process datasets. It defines constants that can be imported and used by other scripts. The constants are directly exported from the module without any transformations or intermediate processing."
  },
  "4. Data Mapping": [
    {
      "Target Dataset Name": "Constants",
      "Target Field Name": "NotFoundStatus",
      "Source Dataset Name": "N/A",
      "Source Field Name": "N/A",
      "Transformation Logic": "Direct assignment of the string value 'Not found'.",
      "Business Purpose": "Provides a standardized status message for scenarios where a value is not found."
    },
    {
      "Target Dataset Name": "Constants",
      "Target Field Name": "MaxJoinLimit",
      "Source Dataset Name": "N/A",
      "Source Field Name": "N/A",
      "Transformation Logic": "Direct assignment of the integer value 2000.",
      "Business Purpose": "Defines a maximum limit for join operations to ensure performance and prevent excessive resource usage."
    }
  ],
  "5. Performance Optimization Strategies": "This script does not involve data processing operations such as JOINs, filtering, or indexing. Its performance optimization lies in its simplicity and the reusability of constants, which reduces redundancy and potential errors in larger scripts.",
  "6. Technical Elements and Best Practices": "The script follows best practices by encapsulating constants within a module, promoting modularity and reusability. It uses clear and descriptive naming conventions ('NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit') to enhance readability. Error handling is implicit, as the constants are predefined and do not depend on external inputs. The script does not include logging or recovery mechanisms, as it is not designed for data processing.",

  "8. Key Outputs": [
    "The script outputs two constants: 'NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit'. These are exported from the 'Constants' module for use in other scripts."
  ],
  "Business Purpose of Outputs": "The outputs provide standardized and reusable values for configuration management within the ECL codebase. 'NotFoundStatus' ensures consistent messaging for missing values, while 'MaxJoinLimit' helps maintain performance and resource constraints in join operations."
