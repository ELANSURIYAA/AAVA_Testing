{
  "1. Overview of Program": "This ECL script defines a module named `Constants` that encapsulates reusable constants for other scripts or modules. The constants include a status message (`NotFoundStatus`) and a numerical limit (`MaxJoinLimit`). These constants are designed to standardize values across the system, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency. The script addresses the business need for centralized configuration management, which simplifies updates and improves maintainability. It serves as a foundational component, connecting to other scripts that require these predefined values.",
  "2. Code Structure and Design": "The `Constants.ecl` script is structured as a single module named `Constants`. This module contains two exported constants: `NotFoundStatus`, a string indicating a 'not found' status, and `MaxJoinLimit`, an integer specifying a maximum limit for join operations. The module design ensures that these constants can be reused across multiple scripts, promoting modularity and reducing hardcoding. The script uses the `EXPORT` keyword to make the constants accessible externally, adhering to ECL's modular programming practices.",
  "3. Data Flow and Processing Logic": {
    "Processed Datasets": [],
    "Data Flow": "This script does not process any datasets. Instead, it defines constants that can be imported and utilized by other scripts. The constants are declared within a module and exported for external use. There is no data transformation, joining, or aggregation involved in this script."
  },
  "4. Data Mapping": [],
  "5. Performance Optimization Strategies": "This script does not involve data processing or performance-intensive operations. However, by centralizing constants in a module, it indirectly optimizes performance by reducing the need for redundant declarations across multiple scripts. This approach minimizes potential errors and simplifies updates, as changes to constants need to be made in only one location.",
  "6. Technical Elements and Best Practices": "The script demonstrates best practices in modular programming by encapsulating constants within a module. It uses clear and descriptive naming conventions (`NotFoundStatus` and `MaxJoinLimit`) to enhance readability and maintainability. The use of the `EXPORT` keyword ensures that the constants are accessible to other scripts, promoting reusability. Although the script does not include error handling or logging, these are unnecessary given its purpose as a constants definition module.",

  "Business Purpose of Outputs": "The script does not produce any direct outputs. Its purpose is to provide reusable constants that support other scripts in maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy. By centralizing these constants, the script facilitates easier updates and ensures uniformity across the system."
