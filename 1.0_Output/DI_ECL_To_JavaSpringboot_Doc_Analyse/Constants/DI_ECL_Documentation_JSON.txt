{
  "1. Overview of Program": "This ECL script defines a module named 'Constants' that encapsulates reusable constants for use across other ECL programs. The constants include a status message 'Not found' and a numeric limit 'MaxJoinLimit' set to 2000. The script serves as a centralized repository for shared values, ensuring consistency and maintainability in larger systems. It addresses the business problem of managing hardcoded values scattered across multiple scripts, reducing redundancy and potential errors. This module can be integrated into various systems requiring these constants, supporting operations like data joins and error handling.",
  "2. Code Structure and Design": "The script is structured as a single module named 'Constants', which contains two exported constants: 'NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit'. The module is designed for reusability, allowing other ECL programs to import and utilize these constants. The use of the EXPORT keyword ensures that the constants are accessible externally, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication. The script is minimalistic, focusing solely on defining shared values without additional logic or transformations.",
  "3. Data Flow and Processing Logic": {
    "Processed Datasets": [],
    "Data Flow": "This script does not process datasets directly. Instead, it provides constants that can be used in other scripts to influence data processing logic. For example, 'MaxJoinLimit' might be used to set a threshold for join operations, while 'NotFoundStatus' could be used for error handling or status reporting."
  },
  "4. Data Mapping": [
    {
      "Target Dataset Name": "Constants",
      "Target Field Name": "NotFoundStatus",
      "Source Dataset Name": "None",
      "Source Field Name": "None",
      "Transformation Logic": "Direct assignment of the string 'Not found'.",
      "Business Purpose": "Provides a standardized status message for error handling or reporting."
    },
    {
      "Target Dataset Name": "Constants",
      "Target Field Name": "MaxJoinLimit",
      "Source Dataset Name": "None",
      "Source Field Name": "None",
      "Transformation Logic": "Direct assignment of the numeric value 2000.",
      "Business Purpose": "Defines a threshold limit for join operations to prevent excessive resource usage."
    }
  ],
  "5. Performance Optimization Strategies": "This script does not include performance optimization strategies, as it does not perform any data processing or transformations. However, by centralizing constants, it indirectly supports performance by reducing redundancy and ensuring consistent configuration across scripts.",
  "6. Technical Elements and Best Practices": "The script adheres to best practices by encapsulating constants within a module, promoting modularity and reusability. The naming conventions are clear and descriptive, making the constants easy to understand and use. Error handling is implicit, as the constants provide predefined values for scenarios like 'Not found' status. The script is minimalistic and does not include logging or recovery mechanisms, as its sole purpose is to define constants.",
