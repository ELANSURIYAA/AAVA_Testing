    "1. Script Overview": {
      "Summary": "This ECL script defines a module named 'Constants' that encapsulates reusable constants for use across other ECL programs. The constants include a status message 'Not found' and a numeric limit 'MaxJoinLimit' set to 2000. The script serves as a centralized repository for shared values, ensuring consistency and maintainability in larger systems. It addresses the business problem of managing hardcoded values scattered across multiple scripts, reducing redundancy and potential errors. This module can be integrated into various systems requiring these constants, supporting operations like data joins and error handling.",
      "Functional Modules": [
        "Module 'Constants' contains two exported constants: 'NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit'."
      ],
      "Data Pipelines Overview": "This script does not orchestrate data pipelines or batch processes. It provides constants for use in other scripts."
