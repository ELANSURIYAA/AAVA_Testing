{
  "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script defines a module called `Constants` that encapsulates two key constants: `NotFoundStatus` and `MaxJoinLimit`. These constants are designed to standardize values across the system, ensuring consistency and maintainability. The script is critical for defining reusable constants that can be referenced in other parts of the ECL codebase.",
    "Functional Modules": [
      "Module `Constants`: Encapsulates constants for reuse.",
      "Constant `NotFoundStatus`: String constant with value 'Not found'.",
      "Constant `MaxJoinLimit`: Integer constant set to 2000."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "This script does not orchestrate data pipelines or batch processes. It serves as a foundational component for other scripts by providing predefined constants."
