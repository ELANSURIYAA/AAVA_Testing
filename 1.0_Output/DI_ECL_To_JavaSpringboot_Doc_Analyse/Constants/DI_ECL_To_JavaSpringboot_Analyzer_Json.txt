  "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script defines a module named `Constants` that encapsulates reusable constants for other scripts or modules. The constants include a status message (`NotFoundStatus`) and a numerical limit (`MaxJoinLimit`). These constants are designed to standardize values across the system, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency. The script addresses the business need for centralized configuration management, which simplifies updates and improves maintainability. It serves as a foundational component, connecting to other scripts that require these predefined values.",
    "Functional Modules": [
      "Module `Constants` contains two exported constants: `NotFoundStatus` (a string) and `MaxJoinLimit` (an integer)."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "This script does not process any datasets. Instead, it defines constants that can be imported and utilized by other scripts. The constants are declared within a module and exported for external use. There is no data transformation, joining, or aggregation involved in this script."
