  "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script defines a module named 'Constants' that exports two constants: 'NotFoundStatus' and 'MaxJoinLimit'. It serves as a centralized location for these values, which can be reused across other parts of the ECL codebase.",
    "Functional Modules": [
      "Constants module: Encapsulates two constants - 'NotFoundStatus' (a string) and 'MaxJoinLimit' (an integer)."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "This script does not orchestrate data pipelines or batch processes. It provides foundational constants for use in other scripts."

  "4. Manual Adjustments for Java Springboot Migration": {
    "Transform Refactoring": "Not applicable as there are no TRANSFORMs.",
    "Schema Redefinition": "Convert the constants into static final variables in a Java class.",
    "Join Handling Strategy": "Not applicable as there are no JOINs.",

    "Refactor vs Rebuild Recommendation": {
      "Approach": "Refactor with minimal changes",
