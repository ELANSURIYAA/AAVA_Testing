# Cost and Effort Estimation for DB2 to Oracle Exadata Migration

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Oracle Exadata Runtime Cost

Based on the analysis of the DB2 script and Oracle Exadata environment details, the estimated cost of running the converted Oracle SQL code is as follows:

- **Single Execution Cost**: $2.688 (assuming a 2-hour runtime)
- **Daily Execution Cost (over a month)**: $80.64
- **Hourly Execution Cost (over a month)**: $967.68

**Assumptions and Reasoning:**
1. Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure costs $1.344 per hour per database node.
2. The script processes data from four tables (customer_master, sales_transactions, product_master, regional_data), each approximately 1GB in size.
3. Approximately 10% of the data (400MB in total) is processed in the queries.
4. The script contains 11 Common Table Expressions (CTEs), complex window functions, and various calculations for customer segmentation and performance metrics.
5. Given the complexity of the script and the data volume, the estimated runtime for a single execution is approximately 1-2 hours.
6. The actual cost may vary depending on query optimization, indexing, and parallel processing capabilities.

## 2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 Manual Code Fixes and Data Recon Testing Effort (in hours)

**Manual Code Fixes: 30-40 hours**
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions): 12-16 hours
- Function Conversion (DAYS(), INT(), YEAR(), MONTH()): 6-8 hours
- Window Functions (DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK()): 4-6 hours
- Joins and Calculations: 8-10 hours

**Data Reconciliation and Validation Testing: 20-25 hours**
- Creating test cases and comparing results between DB2 and Oracle SQL outputs
- Verifying the correctness of calculations, segmentation, and performance metrics
- Testing edge cases, such as null values, outliers, and boundary conditions

**Total Effort: 50-65 hours**

The key areas requiring manual intervention during conversion include:
1. Date Functions (DAYS(), YEAR(), MONTH())
2. Type Conversion (INT())
3. Recency Calculation using DAYS() and INT()
4. Window Functions and Partitioning
5. Joins and Filters, especially when using 1=1 as a placeholder condition
