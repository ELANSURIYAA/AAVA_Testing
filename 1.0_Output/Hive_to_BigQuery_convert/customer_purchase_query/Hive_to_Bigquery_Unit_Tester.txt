**Test Case List:**

1. **Test Case ID:** TC001  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `customer_purchase_summary` CTE for correct aggregation of total spent, order count, and tenure days.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Aggregated values match the input data for given customer IDs.

2. **Test Case ID:** TC002  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `product_category_preferences` CTE for correct ranking of product categories based on spending.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Categories are ranked correctly for each customer.

3. **Test Case ID:** TC003  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `seasonal_spending_patterns` CTE for correct extraction of seasonal data.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Spending data is correctly grouped by quarter, month, and day of the week.

4. **Test Case ID:** TC004  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the final query for correct customer segmentation based on spending tiers.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Customers are segmented into Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze tiers accurately.

5. **Test Case ID:** TC005  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `monthly_purchase_frequency` calculation for edge cases like zero tenure days.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Frequency is calculated correctly, avoiding division by zero errors.

6. **Test Case ID:** TC006  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `top_category` and `second_category` fields for correct identification of preferred categories.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Categories are identified correctly for each customer.

7. **Test Case ID:** TC007  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `q4_q3_growth_pct` calculation for edge cases like zero spending in Q3.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Growth percentage is calculated correctly, avoiding division by zero errors.

8. **Test Case ID:** TC008  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the `recency_score`, `frequency_score`, and `monetary_score` fields for correct RFM scoring.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Scores are calculated correctly based on the respective metrics.

9. **Test Case ID:** TC009  
   **Test Case Description:** Validate the final query for correct filtering of customers with `total_spent > 500`.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Only customers meeting the criteria are included in the result.

10. **Test Case ID:** TC010  
    **Test Case Description:** Validate the final query for correct ordering of customers by `total_spent`.  
    **Expected Outcome:** Customers are ordered in descending order of total spending.
