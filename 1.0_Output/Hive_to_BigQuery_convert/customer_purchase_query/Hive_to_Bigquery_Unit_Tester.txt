**Test Case List:**

1. **Test Case ID:** TC001  
   **Description:** Validate that the query correctly calculates total spending, order count, and customer tenure for a customer with multiple completed orders in 2024.  
   **Expected Outcome:** The total spending, order count, and tenure are accurately calculated based on the input data.

2. **Test Case ID:** TC002  
   **Description:** Ensure that customers with no completed orders in 2024 are excluded from the results.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Such customers are not present in the final output.

3. **Test Case ID:** TC003  
   **Description:** Verify that the customer tier is correctly assigned based on the total spending thresholds.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Customers are categorized as Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze based on their total spending.

4. **Test Case ID:** TC004  
   **Description:** Test the handling of NULL values in key columns like `order_date`, `order_amount`, and `customer_id`.  
   **Expected Outcome:** The query handles NULL values gracefully without errors.

5. **Test Case ID:** TC005  
   **Description:** Validate the calculation of the most preferred product category for customers.  
   **Expected Outcome:** The top category and its spending are correctly identified for each customer.

6. **Test Case ID:** TC006  
   **Description:** Check the seasonal spending patterns for customers across different quarters.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Spending is correctly aggregated by quarter, and the quarter-over-quarter growth percentage is accurately calculated.

7. **Test Case ID:** TC007  
   **Description:** Verify the calculation of weekend vs. weekday spending.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Weekend and weekday spending are correctly aggregated.

8. **Test Case ID:** TC008  
   **Description:** Test the RFM scoring logic for recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.  
   **Expected Outcome:** RFM scores are correctly assigned to customers.

9. **Test Case ID:** TC009  
   **Description:** Ensure that the query correctly limits the results to 1000 customers and orders them by total spending in descending order.  
   **Expected Outcome:** The output contains a maximum of 1000 customers, sorted by total spending.

10. **Test Case ID:** TC010  
    **Description:** Validate the query's behavior with an empty dataset.  
    **Expected Outcome:** The query returns an empty result set without errors.
