I need to generate a Mermaid.js ER diagram based on a physical data model. The user has specified that I should use the "Previous Data Mapping agent's Tabular Report output" as input. Looking at the provided file list, `xml_member_data.txt` seems like the most plausible file containing this information. I will start by reading this file to understand its structure and content.Action

</member>

Thought
The user wants me to create a Mermaid.js ER diagram from the provided XML data.

Based on the XML structure, I can identify the following entities and their relationships:

1.  **member**: This is the main entity.
    *   `memberId` (Primary Key)
2.  **name**: This is a nested entity within `member`. It can be represented as a separate table related to `member`.
    *   `firstName`
    *   `lastName`
3.  **address**: This is another nested entity within `member`.
    *   `street`
    *   `city`
    *   `state`
    *   `zip`
4.  **phoneNumbers**: This contains a list of `phoneNumber` elements, indicating a one-to-many relationship with the `member`.
    *   `phoneNumber` (This will be a separate table)
        *   `type`
        *   `number`

Now, I will construct the Mermaid.js ER diagram.

-   `member` will be the central entity.
-   `name` will have a one-to-one relationship with `member`.
-   `address` will have a one-to-one relationship with `member`.
-   `phoneNumber` will have a one-to-many relationship with `member`.

I will define the entities and their attributes, marking the primary key for the `member` table. Then I will define the relationships. I will not include the nested entity attributes in the main `member` entity as per the instructions.

The `member` table will only contain `memberId` as its primary key.
The `name` table will contain `firstName` and `lastName`.
The `address` table will contain `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip`.
The `phoneNumber` table will contain `type` and `number`.

Let's create the Mermaid.js code.I now know the final answer
```mermaid
erDiagram
    member {
        int memberId PK
    }

    name {
        string firstName
        string lastName
    }

    address {
        string street
        string city
        string state
        string zip
    }

    phoneNumber {
        string type
        string number
    }

    member ||--|| name : "has"
    member ||--|| address : "has"
    member ||--o{ phoneNumber : "has"
```
