I need to analyze the `xml_member_data.txt` file to understand its structure and content. This will help me create the logical data model. I will use the `Read a file's content` tool for this purpose.Action
Read a file's content

{
  "file_path": "/app/6e1bbb5c-e933-4f54-8659-f9b6917f033f/xml_member_data.txt"
}
