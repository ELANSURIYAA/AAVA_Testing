### **1. Physical Layer DDL Script:**

The logical model's one-to-one relationships are best implemented in BigQuery using nested structures (STRUCTs) to improve query performance and maintain a denormalized, entity-centric view. The following DDL script creates a single `Person` table with `ContactInfo` and `Language` details nested within it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `your_project.your_dataset.Person` (
    PersonID STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier for the person."),
    DateOfBirth DATE OPTIONS(description="The date of birth of the person."),
    Gender STRING OPTIONS(description="The gender of the person (e.g., Male, Female, Other)."),
    Race STRING OPTIONS(description="The racial identity of the person."),
    Ethnicity STRING OPTIONS(description="The ethnic background of the person."),
    InsuranceProviderName STRING OPTIONS(description="The name of the health insurance provider company."),
    HealthcareProviderName STRING OPTIONS(description="The name of the person's primary healthcare provider."),
    MaritalStatus STRING OPTIONS(description="The marital status of the person (e.g., Single, Married)."),
    EmploymentStatus STRING OPTIONS(description="The current employment status of the person."),
    EducationLevel STRING OPTIONS(description="The highest level of education attained by the person."),
    Nationality STRING OPTIONS(description="The nationality of the person."),
    EmergencyContactDetails STRING OPTIONS(description="Contact information for a person to be notified in an emergency."),
    SourceSystem STRING OPTIONS(description="The originating system from which the record was sourced."),
    IngestionTimestamp TIMESTAMP OPTIONS(description="The timestamp when the record was ingested into the data platform."),
    LastUpdatedTimestamp TIMESTAMP OPTIONS(description="The timestamp of the last modification to the record."),
    ContactInfo STRUCT<
        AddressLine STRING OPTIONS(description="The full street address of the person."),
        PhoneNumber STRING OPTIONS(description="The primary phone number of the person."),
        EmailAddress STRING OPTIONS(description="The primary email address of the person.")
    > OPTIONS(description="This record stores the various methods of contacting a person."),
    Language STRUCT<
        SpokenLanguage STRING OPTIONS(description="The primary language spoken by the person."),
        WrittenLanguage STRING OPTIONS(description="The primary language for written communication preferred by the person.")
    > OPTIONS(description="This record stores the language preferences for an individual.")
);
