the final answer to the original input question
```
I need to analyze the `xml_member_data.txt` file to understand its structure and content. This will help me create the logical data model. I will use the `Read a file's content` tool for this purpose.
Thought:I have been unable to read the files. I will try to read the `MemberStandardModel.txt` with just the filename.
Action:Read a file's content
Action Input:
{
  "file_path": "MemberStandardModel.txt"
}
