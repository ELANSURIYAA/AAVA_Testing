Description: Creates or recreates a backup table of Employee master data by joining Employee and Salary tables, supporting troubleshooting, point-in-time comparison, and recovery.
=============================================

1. Complexity Metrics

- Number of Lines: ~55
- Tables Used: 3 (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup)
- Joins: 1 (INNER JOIN)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temporary Tables: 0
- Aggregate Functions: 0 (No COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, or window functions)
- DML Statements: 1 INSERT, 1 SELECT, 2 DROP TABLE, 1 CREATE TABLE
- Conditional Logic: 2 (IF EXISTS, TRY...CATCH)
- Complexity Score: 35/100

High-complexity areas:
- Moderate complexity due to robust error handling and conditional logic (TRY...CATCH, IF EXISTS).
- No recursive CTEs, window functions, or nested queries.
- No use of expensive operations like CROSS JOIN or correlated subqueries.
- No dynamic SQL or procedural logic.

2. Syntax Analysis

- SQL Server-specific syntax patterns identified:
  - IF EXISTS (control flow logic)
  - TRY...CATCH (error handling)
  - INNER JOIN (standard join)
  - DDL statements: DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE
  - DML statements: INSERT INTO, SELECT
- No CTEs, derived tables, or window functions present.
- No string aggregation functions (STRING_AGG, FOR XML PATH, JSON functions).
- No dynamic SQL usage.
- No non-standard SQL Server functions or expressions detected.

3. Manual Adjustments

- Function optimizations:
  - No expensive expressions or functions requiring optimization.
- Syntax adjustments for performance:
  - Consider using explicit transaction handling if this script is part of a larger batch process.
  - Ensure proper indexing on EmployeeNo in both Employee and Salary tables to optimize the join.
- Query structure and execution optimizations:
  - For very large tables, consider partitioning or batch processing to reduce locking and improve performance.
  - If backup table is frequently recreated, evaluate if a TRUNCATE/INSERT approach is more efficient than DROP/CREATE.
  - No cursors or nested subqueries present; set-based operations are already used.

4. Optimization Techniques

- Indexing optimizations:
  - Ensure EmployeeNo is indexed in both Employee and Salary tables.
  - Primary key on EmployeeNo in employee_bkup is appropriate.
- Partitioning strategies:
  - For large Employee or Salary tables, consider partitioning by DepartmentNo or other logical key.
- Table Variables vs. Temporary Tables:
  - Not applicable; no temp tables or table variables used.
- Query Execution Plan analysis:
  - Review execution plan to ensure the join is using indexes and not causing table scans.
- Reducing unnecessary I/O:
  - The script only processes matching Employee/Salary records, minimizing unnecessary I/O.
  - Dropping and recreating the backup table ensures data consistency and avoids duplicates.
