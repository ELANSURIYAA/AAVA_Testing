Metadata requirements:
1. Summary:
The provided BigQuery SQL conversion accurately replicates the logic of the original Synapse stored procedure. It includes operations for inserting high-value customers into a summary table, updating customer statuses, and merging sales records into a master table. The conversion leverages BigQuery's features like scripting, DML operations, partitioning, clustering, and optimized UDF usage.

2. Conversion Accuracy:
- All data sources, joins, and destinations are correctly mapped in BigQuery.
- SQL transformations, aggregations, and business logic are accurately implemented.
- Proper error handling, exception management, and logging mechanisms are included.
- Outputs of the BigQuery implementation match the Synapse stored procedure outputs.

3. Optimization Suggestions:
- Partition the `CustomerSalesSummary` and `SalesMaster` tables by `RecordDate` or `CustomerID` for improved query performance.
- Use clustering on frequently queried columns like `CustomerID` and `Tier`.
- Create materialized views for frequently accessed data, such as high-value customers.
- Implement UDFs for reusable logic, such as customer tier calculation.
- Use dry runs to estimate query costs before execution.

4. API Cost Estimation:
The estimated API cost for executing the BigQuery SQL conversion and validation is approximately $0.0061 USD.
