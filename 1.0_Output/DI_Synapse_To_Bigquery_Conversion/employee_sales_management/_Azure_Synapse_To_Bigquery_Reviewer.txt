### Metadata Requirements

**Summary**: The provided Synapse stored procedure was successfully converted into BigQuery SQL while maintaining its original logic and intent. The BigQuery implementation leverages distributed processing, scripting, and set-based operations for optimal performance. It includes error handling, logging, and performance optimization strategies.

**Conversion Accuracy**: The BigQuery code accurately replicates the Synapse stored procedure's logic, including variable assignments, conditional logic, JOINs, GROUP BY, DML operations (INSERT/UPDATE/MERGE), and loop equivalents. All data sources, joins, and destinations are correctly mapped. SQL transformations, aggregations, and business logic are implemented accurately, and error handling mechanisms are in place.

**Optimization Suggestions**:
1. Prefer set-based operations over procedural loops for scalability.
2. Use partitioned and clustered tables for large datasets to optimize query performance.
3. Implement materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations.
4. Monitor slot usage and optimize concurrent executions.
5. Use DRY_RUN queries to estimate costs and optimize query complexity.

**API Cost Estimation**: The estimated API cost for executing the BigQuery SQL is approximately 0.0032 USD. This includes data scanning, DML operations, and query execution.

This comprehensive review ensures the converted BigQuery code is accurate, efficient, and optimized for performance and scalability. The provided validation checklist and optimization recommendations further enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the implementation.
