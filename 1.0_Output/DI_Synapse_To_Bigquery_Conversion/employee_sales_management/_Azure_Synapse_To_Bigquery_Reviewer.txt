Metadata requirements:
1. Summary: The provided Synapse stored procedure and its corresponding BigQuery SQL conversion were reviewed to ensure accurate replication of logic, data flow, and business rules. The BigQuery code was validated for proper data source mapping, SQL transformations, aggregations, error handling, logging mechanisms, and performance optimization.
2. Conversion Accuracy: The conversion accurately replicates the Synapse stored procedure's logic, including audit logging, data quality checks, transformations, and error handling. All data sources, joins, and destinations were correctly mapped, and SQL transformations were implemented as per BigQuery standards. Error handling and logging mechanisms were appropriately adapted to BigQuery scripting.
3. Optimization Suggestions: 
   - Use partitioned and clustered tables for large datasets to improve query performance.
   - Implement materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations.
   - Optimize UDF usage to reduce processing costs.
   - Ensure proper caching mechanisms are in place for repeated queries.
   - Validate IAM roles and permissions for enhanced security.
4. API Cost Estimation: The estimated API cost for the BigQuery implementation is 0.0032 USD, based on the provided DML/DDL operations and data processing.

The BigQuery SQL conversion adheres to best practices, ensuring scalability, performance, and integration capabilities while maintaining the original Synapse stored procedure's functionality. The provided testing framework and reconciliation script further validate the correctness and efficiency of the migration process.
