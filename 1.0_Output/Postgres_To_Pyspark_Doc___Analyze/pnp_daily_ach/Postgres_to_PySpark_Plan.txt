1. Cost Estimation
   1.1 PySpark Runtime Cost:
        - Databricks Pricing: $0.15 - $0.75 per DBU per hour.
        - Data Volume Processed:
            * Total data volume across all tables: ~4.35 TB.
            * Approximately 10% of the data is processed in queries: ~435 GB.
        - Estimated Runtime:
            * Based on the PostgreSQL script, the runtime for the entire process is approximately 2 hours.
        - Cost Calculation:
            * Assuming an average DBU cost of $0.45 per hour.
            * Total DBU hours = 2 hours * 10 DBUs (estimated for the workload).
            * Total Cost = 2 * 10 * $0.45 = $9.00 USD.
        - Reason: The cost is based on the data volume, processing complexity, and average DBU pricing.

2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation:
   2.1 PySpark Code Manual Fixes and Unit Testing Effort:
        - Number of Temporary Tables: 7.
        - Number of Calculations and Transformations: 10.
        - Estimated Effort: 2 hours per table + 1 hour per transformation = 14 + 10 = 24 hours.
   2.2 Output Validation Effort:
        - Comparing PostgreSQL and PySpark outputs for 7 temporary tables.
        - Estimated Effort: 2 hours per table = 14 hours.
   2.3 Total Estimated Effort:
        - Total Effort = 24 (code fixes and testing) + 14 (output validation) = 38 hours.
        - Reason: The effort is based on the number of tables, transformations, and validation steps.

API Cost:
- apiCost: 0.0032 USD.

Final Summary:
1. PySpark Runtime Cost: $9.00 USD.
2. Total Testing Effort: 38 hours.
3. API Cost: $0.0032 USD.
