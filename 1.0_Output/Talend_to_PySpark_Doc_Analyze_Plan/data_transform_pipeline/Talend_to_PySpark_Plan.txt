1. Effort & Cost Estimation

   **1.1 Conversion Effort (Hours)**  
   - Estimated hours required to convert each component type:
     - Simple Mappings (e.g., tMap, tInput): `8` hours  
     - Complex Transformations (e.g., tDenormalize, tLoop): `16` hours  
     - Job Control/Orchestration (e.g., tRunJob, onSubJobOK): `12` hours  
     - Context Variables and External Configs: `4` hours  

   **1.2 Testing Effort (Hours)**  
   - Unit Testing and Validation Effort: `10` hours  
   - Performance Benchmarking and Optimization: `6` hours  

   **1.3 Total Estimated Effort**  
   - Total Hours: `56` hours  
   - Estimated Developer Cost: `$56 * 50 = $2800 USD`

   **1.4 Recommendation: Refactor vs Rebuild**  
   - Option: `Refactor`  
   - Reason: Due to moderate complexity (70/100) and the presence of reusable Talend logic, refactoring is recommended. This approach minimizes rework while ensuring the logic is optimized for PySpark.

2. API Usage & Cost  
   - `apiCost`: 0.0173 USD  // Cost consumed by the API including all decimal values.
