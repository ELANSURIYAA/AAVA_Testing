### Test Case Document:
1. **Test Case ID**: TC001  
   **Description**: Validate extraction of employee data from the source database.  
   **Preconditions**: Source database connection is active and accessible.  
   **Test Steps**:  
      - Mock the database connection.  
      - Execute the `extract_employee_data` method.  
   **Expected Result**: A DataFrame containing employee data is returned with correct columns and data types.  
   **Actual Result**: (To be filled during execution)  
   **Pass/Fail Status**: (To be filled during execution)  

2. **Test Case ID**: TC002  
   **Description**: Validate transformation of employee data with department and location lookups.  
   **Preconditions**: Employee, department, and location data are available.  
   **Test Steps**:  
      - Provide sample data for employees, departments, and locations.  
      - Execute the `transform_employee_data` method.  
   **Expected Result**: Transformed DataFrame includes derived columns and joined data.  
   **Actual Result**: (To be filled during execution)  
   **Pass/Fail Status**: (To be filled during execution)  

3. **Test Case ID**: TC003  
   **Description**: Validate loading of transformed data into the destination database.  
   **Preconditions**: Destination database connection is active and accessible.  
   **Test Steps**:  
      - Mock the database connection.  
      - Execute the `load_employee_data` method with transformed data.  
   **Expected Result**: Data is successfully loaded into the destination table.  
   **Actual Result**: (To be filled during execution)  
   **Pass/Fail Status**: (To be filled during execution)  

4. **Test Case ID**: TC004  
   **Description**: Validate error handling during data extraction failure.  
   **Preconditions**: Source database connection is active but query execution fails.  
   **Test Steps**:  
      - Mock the database connection to throw an exception.  
      - Execute the `extract_employee_data` method.  
   **Expected Result**: Error is logged, and the process terminates gracefully.  
   **Actual Result**: (To be filled during execution)  
   **Pass/Fail Status**: (To be filled during execution)  

5. **Test Case ID**: TC005  
   **Description**: Compare performance between SSIS and Python implementations.  
   **Preconditions**: Both implementations are available for testing.  
   **Test Steps**:  
      - Execute the ETL process with small and large datasets in both implementations.  
      - Measure execution time and memory usage.  
   **Expected Result**: Python implementation performs comparably or better than SSIS.  
   **Actual Result**: (To be filled during execution)  
   **Pass/Fail Status**: (To be filled during execution)  

### Pytest Script:
