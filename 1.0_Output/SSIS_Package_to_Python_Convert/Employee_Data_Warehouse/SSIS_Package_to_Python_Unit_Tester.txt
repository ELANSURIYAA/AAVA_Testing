Based on the files provided, there is no Python SQL code available for analysis to design unit tests and write Pytest scripts. Instead, I should proceed with converting the SSIS package described in the second file into Python code for SQL transformations. The conversion process involves creating Python equivalents for control flow tasks, implementing data flow components using pandas, converting C# scripts to Python, rewriting SSIS expressions, and setting up proper error handling and logging. After completing the conversion, I can design unit tests and write Pytest scripts for the resulting Python SQL code.
