Potential Issue:
- Description: RETAIN or LAG logic not handled. In SAS, RETAIN statements keep variable values across iterations of a data step, and LAG functions reference previous row values. The Python code does not use pandas' shift() or explicit loops to replicate this, so any logic depending on these features in SAS would be missing.
- Recommendation: Review the original SAS code for RETAIN or LAG usage. If present, implement pandas shift() or custom looping in Python to preserve or reference prior values as needed.

Potential Issue:
- Description: FIRST. or LAST. logic not implemented. SAS uses FIRST.variable and LAST.variable (after BY-group processing) to identify the first or last row in a group. The Python code does not use groupby() with head(), tail(), or custom indexing to mimic this, so group-level logic may be missing.
- Recommendation: If the SAS code used BY-group processing with FIRST./LAST., implement equivalent logic in Python using groupby() and appropriate row selection.

Potential Issue:
- Description: Temporary tables or intermediate steps may be omitted. SAS often uses multiple DATA steps or temporary datasets for staged processing. The Python code appears to process data in a single flow (read, clean, analyze), so intermediate transformations or checks may not be replicated.
- Recommendation: Review the SAS workflow for intermediate datasets or steps. If present, ensure each transformation or validation is explicitly implemented in Python, possibly as additional functions or DataFrame copies.

Potential Issue:
- Description: Macro variables and global/local symbol resolution not reflected. SAS macro variables allow for dynamic code and parameterization. The Python code does not use environment variables, config files, or function parameters to replicate this, so dynamic aspects of the SAS code may be lost.
- Recommendation: If the SAS code used macro variables, implement equivalent Python variables, function arguments, or configuration management to preserve dynamic behavior.

Potential Issue:
- Description: Business rules (flags, thresholds, filters) may be missing. SAS code often contains IF-THEN/ELSE logic for business rules, flags, or conditional processing. The Python clean_data() function only shows generic missing value handling, renaming, and type conversion, with no explicit business rule logic.
- Recommendation: Review the SAS code for IF-THEN/ELSE statements or other business rules. If present, add corresponding logic in Python (e.g., DataFrame filtering, column creation, or conditional assignments).
